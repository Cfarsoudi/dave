     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     A place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround
     an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana
     palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.

     Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the
     waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of
     the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.

     For a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many
     VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.

     The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger
     than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder.

     INT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY

     A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage.
     The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a
     veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to
     have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight
     shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...

     SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish,
     drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids,
     in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.

     His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon
     the girls.

     KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.

     NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's
     walk, then turns to the girl at her side...

     KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.

                                  NICOLE
                  When we graduate the only thing I'm
                  going to miss is...
                         (with a nod to the stage)
                  Know what I mean?

     Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam.  Nicole has to nudge her.

                                  NICOLE (CONT'D)
                  Kelly?

                                  KELLY
                         (still staring)
                  Oh yeah.

     Sam is at the podium.  He looks out across the audience.  There
     are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter.  Sam smiles,
     silencing them with a wave of his hand.

                                  SAM
                  We've come to the halfway point in my
                  senior seminars...

     Cheers, applause.  Sam waits for the kids to settle.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                  No!

     Boos as we FIND...

     JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.  He sits with a clique
     of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue
     Bay School.  Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...

     SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just
     enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a
     loner.  She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.

                                  SAM
                  Thank you, Jimmy.

                                  JIMMY
                  Hey, man, at least in study hail I could
                  meditate.

                                  KIRK (O.S.)
                  He means masturbate...

     This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND...

     KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.

                                  SAM
                  Something Kirk with which I'm sure you
                  have hands-on experience.

     Loud laughter.  Sam quiets them again, then turns to the
     blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X.
     The kids start to cheer.

     Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S.

     The cheering fades into silence.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  We've all heard the words, date rape,
                  sexual harassment.  We've talked about
                  some of these things in this room.
                         (beat)
                  Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay
                  Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray
                  Duquette and Gloria Perez.
                         (beat)
                  They're here to give you what we hope
                  will be a fresh perspective on these
                  subjects, and to answer any questions
                  you night have.

     Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors...

     RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light
     heavyweight, walks out onto the stage.  He's dressed in a dark
     suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses.

     GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.  She's a good six inches shorter
     than Ray, with a sweet face.  Attractive but no stunner.

     About five kids applaud.  Ray takes the podium.

                                  RAY
                  Thank you for having us.  We'll each
                  talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then
                  open it up to your questions...

     IN THE AUDIENCE

     Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet.  As she passes behind
     Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath.

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm not going to listen to this
                  jack-off.

     She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door..

     Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...

                                  RAY
                  Let's begin with a question.  What is a
                  sex crime?

     A moment.

                                  JIMMY
                  Not getting any.

     This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles
     from Sam and Gloria.  And none at all from Ray Duquette.

     EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

     The kids change classes.  Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass.
     The kids swarm past.  A pair of girls flash by.

                                  CAROLE
                  Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo.

                                  SAM

                  Hey, Carole, you too.  And be good.

                                  CAROLE
                         (beneath a pouty look)
                  I hate to be good.

     The three adults ENTER an old wooden building.

     INT. BUILDING - DAY

                                  SAM
                  This is one of the original buildings.
                  We have the offices here now.

     The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs.
     Gloria stops before one of the photos.

     ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH

     An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to
     another age.

     A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat
     under sail.  His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an
     unseen horizon.  There is something in this boy's pose, in the
     line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has
     fixed upon is the future itself.

                                  GLORIA
                  Anybody in particular?

     When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side.  He
     stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria.

                                  SAM
                  Sam Lombardo.  The first.  Class of
                  'Forty-Two
                         (beat)
                  My father.

     Gloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and
     back again.

                                  VOICE (0.S.)
                  Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos
                  around here.

     Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a
     baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene.

                                  SAM
                  Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and
                  Duquette.
                         (to the cops)
                  Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.

     Art and the detectives shake hands.

                                  ART
                  So, did you set 'em all straight on the
                  ugly facts of life?

                                  SAM
                  I have the feeling, they got it down
                  already.  They're a step ahead of us,
                  Artie.

     Gloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks
     at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at
     which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.

                                  RAY
                  I've got that two o'clock in town.

                                  GLORIA
                         (nodding)
                  Back to the land of grownups.

     The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art.

                                  SAM
                         (to Gloria)
                  If old pictures interest you, come back
                  some time, there's quite a collection
                  down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a
                  proper tour.

                                  GLORIA
                         (smiling)
                  I'd like that.

     Ray opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it.

     Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway.
     Sam remains near the doors, watching as...

     ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL

     Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range
     Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus,
     which they get into and drive away.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER

     Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden
     pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the
     bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks.

     ANGLE ON DOCKS

     As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one
     student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets
     about tying off the boat.

     Sam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder.

                                  SAM
                         (loud enough to be heard
                          by his class)
                  Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil
                  those dock lines and I'll see you all on
                  Monday.

     He watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon
     the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in
     work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky.

     EXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER

     hosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as...
     A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake.

                                  JIMMY
                  All right.  I could party on that.

     Sam just laughs at him.

                                  SAM
                  That's about all it's good for.
                         (beat)
                  That's the one to have.

     He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the
     bay, under sail.

                                  SAM
                  The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that
                  one summer.
                         (beat)
                  Long time ago.

     He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.

                                  JIMMY
                  You know, I want to thank you for
                  getting me into this class...  No way was
                  my old man going to spring for the
                  fees...

                                  SAM
                  Hey, you're working for it.
                         (beneath a laugh)
                  Least you're supposed to be.

     He tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but
     catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                  Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys?

     Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the
     dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse
     knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at
     the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam
     with a coy smile.

                                  KELLY
                  So who's washing your car this weekend,
                  Mr. Lombardo?
                         (off Sam's blank look)
                  The senior car wash, remember?
                         (beat)
                  Tamara's making a schedule.  She said
                  you bought a coupon but you're not on
                  anybody's list.

     Sam smiles, remembering.

                                  SAM
                  Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a
                  Washing ticket, support the effort.
                  That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste
                  of time, don't you think?

     Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the
     dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then.

                                  KELLY
                  Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I
                  do it?  We're working as a team.

     Sam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.

                                  SAM
                  Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out
                  to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys
                  can wash the mud off.

                                  KELLY
                  Deal.
                         (beat)
                  You know, I just looked out front.  My
                  ride wasn't there.  You suppose you
                  could give me one?

     Sam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  You wouldn't want me to walk, would you?
                  I mean like, something bad might happen.

     Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who
     seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.

                                  SAM
                  What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?

                                  JIMMY
                         (still looking at Kelly)
                  What?

                                  SAM
                  A ride.  You want one?

                                 JIMMY
                  Yeah.  But I got my bike.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning
     that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which
     is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His
     arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy.

     As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit
     VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.

     A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall
     black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...

     Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff
     jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.

     Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.

                                  SAM
                  We got room for one more, Suzie.  You
                  need a ride?

     Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them.

                                  KELLY
                  Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes?
                  Whores-4-Less?

     Suzie's eyes go cold.  She signals the groundsman, who turns the
     key.  The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.  Suzie flashes a smile, then
     sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  That's cute.

     Suzie gives her the finger.  Sam makes eye contact with Suzie,
     offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                         (to Suzie)
                  I hope you swallow it.

     Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away.

     EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid
     lush, tropical settings.

     Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "VAN RYAN"
     woven into their wrought-iron design.  Beyond the gates a long
     drive leads toward a huge stone house.  Kelly jumps out, punches
     in a code.  The gates swing open.

                                  KELLY
                  Don't forget the car wash.

                                  SAM
                  I won't.

     SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42
     in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.  When
     she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive.

     Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.  When she sees her
     mother coming toward her, her face hardens.

                                  SANDRA
                  Is that Sam Lombardo?

                                  KELLY
                         (sarcastic)
                  Hi, Mon.

                                  SANDRA
                  Sam!  Hi!

     Sam has already hung a U.

     Sandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep.

     Jimmy is checking her out.  All eyes.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                         (to Sam; as if Jimmy
                          wasn't even there)
                  What?  You're going to drive off without
                  even saying hi?

                                  SAM
                  Hi, Sandy.

                                  SANDRA
                  Why don't you come in, have a drink?

                                  SAM
                  Can't.  Got a passenger.

     Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy.

                                  SANDRA
                  He can wait.

     Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front
     of the house, watching.

                                  SAM
                  I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.

                                  SANDRA
                  I'll bet.
                         (then, softening)
                  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this
                  weekend.  We'll take the boat out...

                                  SAM
                         (cutting her off)
                  Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.

                                  SANDRA
                  What?  Running over alligators with that
                  silly swamp jalopy when you could be
                  sailing a real boat...

                                  SAM
                  Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you
                  a look into the muck we all crawled out
                  of.  You ought to try it some time.

     Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.

     CLOSE ON KELLY

     still at the door, a cold smile on her face.

                                                 FADE TO:

     EXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

     Neat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in
     tropical heat.

     A BMW Z-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac.  Nicole
     is driving.  Kelly sits beside her.

                                  NICOLE
                  This is it?

     Kelly looks at a pad of paper, nods.

                                  KELLY
                  Four-thirty-seven.

     They pass a couple of teenagers playing basketball in a driveway,
     a guy mowing his yard.

                                  NICOLE
                  Nice.

                                  KELLY
                  What do you want, he's a teacher for
                  Christ's sake.
                         (beat)
                  It's here.  Pull over.

     Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses.  Sam's muddy
     Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive.  Behind that is a red
     Mercedes convertible.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on
     the bed.  Barbara is dressed for tennis.  Sam wears a baggy pair
     of khaki shorts.  Barbara struggles to escape.  Sam grabs a leg,
     kisses the back of her knee.

     He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her
     thighs.

                                  BARBARA
                         (getting just a little
                          breathless)
                  Sam, come on... I'm gonna be late for my
                  game...

     Sam keeps at it.  She's starting to weaken.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  Not that I'm going to be much good after
                  last night...

                                  SAM
                  Eat a power bar.

     Barbara starts to giggle.  He's just about got her when...

     The DOORBELL RINGS.  Sam lets go.  Barbara sighs.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam goes to the front door, opens it, to find...

     Kelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags.  The girls
     are dressed in Blue Bay High T-shirts, cropped to REVEAL flat
     tummies, shorts and running shoes.

                                  GIRLS
                  Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam looks over the girls -- a small, exasperated smile.

                                  KELLY
                  Look, he forgot.  I knew it.

                                  SAM
                  No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's
                  nice and dirty for you.
                         (beat)
                  But you might want to wait a minute.
                  The Mercedes is leaving.

                                  NICOLE
                  You mean that isn't yours too?

     The girls giggle.  Sam smiles.

                                  KELLY
                  Where's the hose?  We can set up.

                                  SAM
                  In back of the garage.

     As they walk away, he is joined by Barbara.  She watches the
     girls with an appraising eye.

                                  BARBARA
                  Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?

                                  SAM
                  Kelly.

                                  BARBARA
                  She's going to wash your Jeep?

                                  SAM
                  Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told
                  'em they could hose down the Jeep.
                         (off Barbara's look)
                  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.

     Barbara laughs at him.

                                  BARBARA
                  Sam the philanthropist.
                         (a beat)
                  Tomorrow, right?

     Sam nods.  Another kiss.

     EXT. SAM'S DRIVEWAY - SAME

     As Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind
     the garage.  She looks at Sam, standing in his doorway, watching
     the girls.  When he sees Barbara looking at him, he shrugs, then
     waves.

     EXT. FRONT DOOR - SAM'S HOUSE - LATER

     Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet
     T-shirt derby, ring the bell.

     Sam answers.  He looks them over.  A couple of houses down he can
     see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching
     the girls, then turning to walk back to his house.

                                  SAM
                  So, where you off to now?

                                  KELLY
                  Aren't  you forgetting something?
                          (off Sam's look)
                  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.

                                  SAM
                  Jeez, that thing... Can't you...

                                  KELLY
                         (smiling)
                  Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

     Nicole laughs.

                                  SAM
                  All right.  I'll have to look for it.

                                  KELLY
                         (as he starts to go)
                  Mr. Lombardo.
                         (as he stops)
                  We're running kind of late.  How about
                  if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You
                  could give me a ride when you find the
                  ticket.

     Sam looks at her, as does Nicole.

                                  SAM
                  Give me a minute.

     He hurries from the room.  Kelly turns to Nicole, giving her the
     eye, pointing toward the drive.

                                  NICOLE
                         (mouthing the words)
                  Are you sure?

     Kelly nods, a mischievous smile on her face.

     INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam is rummaging through drawers.  He stops when he hears the
     SOUND of a CAR.  He goes to the window in time to see Nicole's
     BMW headed down his street.

     INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam ENTERS the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where
     the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the
     linoleum.

     Sam looks at the water.  He looks at Kelly.  She moves a step
     closer, allowing the door to SWING shut behind her.

     EXT. SAM'S NEIGHBORHOOD

     A long, slow, Antonioni PAN -- time passes -- the cul-de-sac --
     the sparkling lawns -- the kids with the basketball -- a jogger
     passing by...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. SAM'S PORCH - LATER

     The front door.  The door opens.  Kelly comes out, fast, slamming
     the door behind her.  She walks down the drive.

     There are tears on her face.  As she hits the street, she begins
     to run.

     The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer.
     He watches as the girl runs by.

     The teenagers are still playing hoops.  They stop as Kelly jogs
     past, sobbing.  They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac
     and DISAPPEARS around a corner.

     EXT. THE EVERGLADES - DAY

     Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat,
     rips through the Florida swamp land.

     He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall
     grass which whips at the hull of his boat.  Bits and pieces of
     debris fly through the air.  Sam smiles, swinging the boat
     through a series of wide, sliding turns.

     Suddenly he spots something.  He throttles down gliding into a
     shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found
     out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT

                                  SAM
                  Sly old fucker.  How you got so big,
                  wasn't it?

     Sam sits for a moment in the silence.  He pulls a pair of
     binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them.

     ANGLE ON HORIZON

     All we SEE is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings
     shimmering in the last long light of afternoon.

     Sam watches for some time.  At last he lowers the binoculars,
     revs up his engine and leaves.

     ANGLE ON SAM'S BOAT

     as it moves away, as SEEN from water level where...

     The old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold
     primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky
     waters of the swamp.

     EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Sam's Wrangler pulls in next to Barbara's Mercedes.  The Jeep is
     muddy once more.  So is Sam.  He gets out.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - SAME

     Sam ENTERS.  The house is dark.

                                   SAM
                  Barbara?

     Nothing.  Me CROSSES the living room and starts down the hallway,
     where a faint light issues from beneath the bedroom door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam opens the door.  He hears the SOUND of RUNNING WATER.  He
     walks across the room and into the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam.  Behind the glass
     door we SEE an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water.
     Sam opens the shower door.  The steam clears to REVEAL Barbara's
     gorgeous athletic body.

                                  BARBARA
                  It's hot in here, just the way you like
                  it.

     She grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow.  They
     kiss.  She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants.  His clothes
     fall away.  Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard.  She
     holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping
     her legs around his hips as...

     The water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - NIGHT

     Kelly Van Ryan sits on the dock, looking back toward the huge
     stone house, where...

     A YELLOW LIGHT burns in one of the upstairs windows.

     Kelly has a shotgun laid across her knees.  Slowly, she raises
     the gun, pointing at the yellow window.

     She holds it there for some time, then, softly, to herself...

                                  KELLY
                  Bang...

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - VAN RYAN ESTATE - NEXT DAY

     Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs
     of pleasure... Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big,
     buffed-out Cuban.  They're making love on the bed.  She throws
     her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is
     near, as...

     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table.  They try to ignore
     it.  No dice.  Sandra groans, finally pulling away.

                                  SANDRA
                  Goddamnit!
                         (she answers)
                  Hello.

                                  COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
                  Hello, this is the attendance office at
                  Blue Bay School.  Your son or daughter
                  is absent today, Monday...

                                  SANDRA
                  Jesus H. Christ!

     She hangs up hard.  Sits on the edge of the bed.

                                  FRANKIE
                  What?

     Sandra waves him off.  She pulls on a T-shirt, then grabs up the
     phone once more, punching in a number.

     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Desk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a
     photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall.  There's a
     Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with "Sam Lombardo -- Blue
     Bay Educator of the Year."

     Sam is working on the computer.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers.

                                  SAM
                  Counseling.

     XNTERCUT - SANDRA/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION

     Sandra seated on the bed, one long leg tucked beneath her.

                                  SANDRA
                  Sam, Sandy Van Ryan.

     Frankie's eyes go cold when he hears the word "Sam."

     In his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer,
     stiffening noticeably.

                                  SAM
                  Sandy... What's up?

                                  SANDRA
                  Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you
                  talked to her?

                                  SAM
                  No.

                                  SANDRA
                  Shit. Here we go again.

                                  SAM
                  Didn't you see her this morning?

                                  SANDRA
                  To tell you the truth, I haven't seen
                  her since Friday.

     BOOM -- A SHOTGUN BLASTS outside Sandra's window.  She jumps.
     BOOM, BOOM -- more BLASTS.  She jumps up to look outside.

     SANDRA'S POV - KELLY

     stands at the edge of the bay, launching skeet then blasting them
     high above the water.

     BACK TO SCENE

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Never mind.  I found her.
                         (a long beat)
                  Listen, Sam.  It was good seeing you the
                  other day.
                         (beat)
                  I haven't found anyone else can handle
                  the Jonathan like you can.

     She glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough.  He gives her a
     long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room.

     Sam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank,
     unblinking eyes.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara
                  Baxter.  So what?

                                  SAM
                  So maybe I'm a one-woman man.

     Sandra laughs.

                                  SANDRA
                  Right.
                         (beat)
                  You really think you're gonna get one of
                  these Blue Bay women to marry you?

     Sandra pauses to laugh once more.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand
                  around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.

                                  SAM
                  Goodbye, Sandra.

     Sam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the
     barest hint of a smile plays upon his face.

     Sandra slams down her phone.  She looks to the bay, to the sleek
     racing sloop floating beyond the private dock.

                                  SANDRA
                  The nerve of some people.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY

     The SHOTGUN BLASTS away.  Kelly pauses to reload.  She catches
     sight of...

     Sandra, approaching from the main house.

                                  SANDRA
                  You seem to find guns therapeutic.
                  Maybe I oughta try it.

     Kelly lets the gun's barrel drift over Sandra, then turns to walk
     away.  She moves toward the guest house.  A used-brick cottage
     tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan
     tree.  Sandra follows.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Let me guess, some boy didn't call and
                  screwed up the weekend.  So you're
                  taking the day off.

     Kelly looks toward the main house, in time to see...

     Frankie walk from the bedroom and dive into the pool.

                                  KELLY
                  Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?

                                  SANDRA
                  Whichever one I want.

     Kelly turns away, starts for the guest house once more.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

     PAN to REVEAL room -- the gun case, the animal trophies, the
     photos -- One of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker
     chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee.  Others of Kelly
     and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their
     rifles above slain wildebeests and bison.

     Sandra and Kelly ENTER.  Kelly puts down the shotgun, turns,
     tears in her eyes.

                                  SANDRA
                  Okay, what's the matter?

                                  KELLY
                  You notice my new jumper?

     Kelly does a three-sixty, like a model on a runway.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  My friends buy me clothes, so I don't
                  look like trash.

                                  SANDRA
                  I would hardly say you look like trash.

                                  KELLY
                  No thanks to you.

     She sits on the bed.  Sandra moves to stand over her, angry now.

                                  SANDRA
                  Come off of it.
                         (a beat)
                  You run with all these little trust fund
                  brats... They think money grows on
                  trees.  It doesn't.  Believe me.  And a
                  lot of your little friends are gonna
                  learn that one the hard way.
                         (beat)
                  I'm trying to spare you that.

     Kelly goes to one shoulder on the bed, sobbing now.  Her mother
     continues to stand over her, suddenly more perplexed than angry.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Kelly.  What is it?

                                  KELLY
                  I miss Dad.

                                  SANDRA
                  Jesus.
                         (a long beat)
                  Well, I do too, sometimes...

                                  KELLY
                  No you don't.

                                  SANDRA
                  He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.
                  He could have gone out and gotten a job.
                  Christ, he could've found another rich
                  woman... He never had a problem tucking
                  my friends when we were married.

     She pauses as Kelly cries all the harder.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  I don't know why he did it.  I really
                  don't...

     Her voice trails away, as meanwhile Kelly has drawn herself up
     into a fetal position on the bed.  The sobbing has stopped but
     her shoulders continue to shake.  Sandra sits on the edge of the
     bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Can I get you anything?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

     Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss.  At last she stands.
     She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the
     words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.

                                  SANDRA
                  What, honey?  I can't hear you.

     There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself.  She stares at
     the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she
     enunciates each word.

                                  KELLY
                  I said.  I was raped.

     Sandra looks as if she has been struck.

                                  SANDRA
                  What?

                                  KELLY
                  I was raped.
                         (a long beat)
                  By Sam Lombardo.

     Sandra moves over to the bed, sits once more.

                                  SANDRA
                  He... Sam Lombardo?

                                  KELLY
                  Yes.  God, Mom...

     Kelly begins to cry.  Sandra pulls her upright, cradling her in
     her arms, eyes on fire.

     EXT. BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - DAY

     An old Spanish-style building sits before a neat square of grass.

                                  SANDRA (V.O.)
                  My daughter does not get raped in Blue
                  Bay!

     INT. STATION HOUSE - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Sandra slams a fist on the conference table.

     Kelly is seated between her mother and her mother's attorney, TOM
     BAXTER.  Baxter sports an Italian suit and a lethal Alexander
     Haig look.

     Seated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and BRYCE HUNTER,
     the local D.A.

     Silence follows Sandra's outburst.  Baxter reaches to squeeze
     Sandra's shoulder.  Kelly puts her face in her hands.

                                  RAY
                         (in a quiet voice)
                  You're saying that Kelly was raped by
                  Sam Lombardo.

                                  SANDRA
                  That's right.

     Ray and Gloria exchange looks.  Gloria in particular looks
     slightly stunned.

                                  GLORIA
                  The guidance counselor at Blue Bay?

                                  SANDRA
                         (sarcastically)
                  The guidance counselor at Blue Bay.

                                  GLORIA
                  We understand your feelings, Ms. Van
                  Ryan.  But please, we'd like some time
                  with Kelly.  We'd like to take her
                  statement alone.

     Baxter nods, yes.  Sandra looks at Kelly.

                                  SANDRA
                  Are you okay for this?

     Kelly nods.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  The man must be insane to think he can
                  do this to me...

     Tom Baxter takes her by the arm as Ray CROSSES the room to open
     the door.  Bryce Hunter walks out with then.

     Gloria takes a seat closer to Kelly.  When she speaks, she is
     very calm and quiet.

                                  GLORIA
                  How are you, Kelly? Would you like to
                  take a break for a minute?

                                  KELLY
                         (shaking her head)
                  I just want to get it over with.  My
                  mom's making me do this. I just want to
                  forget it.

                                  GLORIA
                  I know you do.

     She waits as Ray sets up a camera on a tripod.

                                  GLORIA (CCNT'D)
                  We'd like to videotape the statement if
                  that's all right with you.

     Kelly shrugs.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  I know this is not pleasant, Kelly.  But
                  these are serious charges and we need to
                  know everything that happened between
                  you and Mr. Lombardo.
                         (beat)
                  Are you ready?

     Kelly nods.

     CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - KELLY'S STATEMENT

                                  KELLY
                  He started rubbing my shoulders.  Said
                  must be sore after washing cars.  I...
                  let him  I mean he's a nice guy.
                         (beat)
                  I don't know... It was so fast.  I
                  closed my eyes.  I remember his hands
                  moved to my breasts.  I mean just for a
                  second it was nice... I forgot whore I
                  was.  I mean he's so gorgeous...

     PULL BACK to REVEAL...

     INT. STATION HOUSE - DAY

     Ray, Gloria and Bryce Hunter stand at one end of the long
     conference table, watching the playback of Kelly's tape.

     BACK TO VIDEOTAPE

                                  KELLY
                  The next thing... his hand was in my
                  shorts... you know, from behind.  His
                  fingers... his fingers...

                                  KELLY
                  They were in me.  Both places... you
                  know.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  I understand.

                                  KELLY
                  He said something like, "Do you want it
                  dirty7" or something.
                         (beat)
                  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me

                  Was there penetration?  Did he put

                                  KELLY
                  Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean
                  that's how it sounded in my head.  He
                  hurt me...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                         (as Kelly breaks into
                          tears)
                  That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.
                         (beat)
                  But I have to ask you something here.
                  When you say it hurt.  Was this the
                  first time a man was inside you?

                                  KELLY
                  No.  I've done it a couple of times, I
                  mean with guys I dated.  But this
                  hurt... like, he was built... you
                  know...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  He was large?


     Kelly nods, starts to break down again, then holds it off.

                                  GLORIA (O.S., CONT'D)
                  Did you try to fight him?

                                  KELLY
                  I... he had my wrists pinned behind me.
                  I remember my hands were cold.'

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Then what?

                                  KELLY
                  He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it
                  happen."  Then he just stopped.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  You mean he withdrew...

                                  KELLY
                  Not at first.  He was still inside but
                  he wasn't moving or anything...  He said
                  we had this secret.  And that now he'd
                  be able to help me... because we were
                  close... Something like that.  I don't
                  know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Try, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                  I know one thing he said.  It was
                  when... when he took himself out and was
                  standing up.
                         (beat)
                  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come."
                  I can't forget that.  He said, "No
                  little girl can ever make me come."

     The tape is paused -- FREEZES on Kelly's face ON SCREEN.

     BACK TO RAY, GLORIA & HUNTER

                                  HUNTER
                  "No little girl can ever make me come."
                  Jesus.  Too bad.  We might have some
                  physical evidence.

     Ray and Gloria stare at the screen.

                                  GLORIA
                  I don't know.  It feels wrong.

     Ray and Hunter look at her.

                                  HUNTER
                  Why?

                                  GLORIA
                  I think she's acting.  I think she set
                  it up to be alone with him because she
                  wanted him to come on to her.
                         (beat)
                  I think maybe she's upset that he
                  didn't...

                                  RAY
                  Or maybe she thought that was what she
                  wanted and she got a little more than
                  she bargained for...

                                  HUNTER
                  The line I get on this guy, is that he's
                  done half the women in Blue Bay.

                                  GLORIA
                  That doesn't make him a child rapist.
                         (beat)
                  There's something else.  This girl's had
                  some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her
                  mom's cars.  Ran away...

                                  HUNTER
                  Where's this coming from?

                                  GLORIA
                  I worked Juvenile in Dade County for
                  three years.  We had a missing persons
                  on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe
                  a year ago... The family kept it out of
                  the papers.

                                  RAY
                  That would make it about the time of her
                  old man's suicide.  You don't think that
                  could explain some erratic behavior?

                                  GLORIA
                  All I'm saying is, I think we should go
                  slow here.

     Hunter puts his hands together, thinking.  He looks from Ray to
     Gloria, than back to Ray.

                                  HUNTER
                  I want a full-scale investigation.

                                  GLORIA
                  You know what that will mean for
                  Lombardo.

                                  HUNTER
                  I don't care.  You heard that girl's
                  statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me
                  a case.

     Gloria and Ray watch as Hunter gets up and leaves the room.

                                  GLORIA
                  Well you were a big help.  You know
                  what's going to happen if we go
                  full-bore on this.

     Ray looks at the screen.

                                  RAY
                  It's our job, Gloria.

                                  GLORIA
                  Hunter's making it our job because
                  Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass.
                  You know that as well as I do.
                         (beat)
                  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I
                  keep asking myself if it's really
                  necessary.

     Ray thinks this over.  He continues to study the screen.

     CLOSE ON SCREEN - KELLY'S FACE

                                  RAY (0.S.)
                  Yeah, well, maybe you're wrong about
                  him.  Maybe he's got it coming.

     BEGIN MONTAGE - INVESTIGATION

     EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

     Ray takes notes, talks with neighbors, kids, lawn mower man.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DRIVEWAY - DAY

     Gloria talks with students -- Jimmy, Nicole, others.

     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

     Sam sits at his desk, toying with a pencil.  He watches students
     pass -- no smiles, no waves, an occasional dark look.

     Through the press of students Sam sees Art at the door of his
     office.  The two men look at one another.  At which point...

     Gloria, followed by Ray, steps INTO SCENE.  The detectives shake
     hands with Art.  As Art turns to close the door, Sam falls within
     his line of vision.  Art looks away.  The door swings shut.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL DOCKS - LATER

     The sky has begun to color.  Art Maddox stands on the grass at
     the end of the channel separating the slips, watching as...

     A lone sailboat tacks toward the school.

     ANGLE ON BOAT - SAM & JIMMY

     Sam drops his sail, leaving himself just enough momentum to
     cruise expertly into the little channel then into the slip.

     Art watches as Jimmy jumps from the boat, ties it off.

                                  SAM
                  That's good, Jimbo.  I'll see you on
                  Monday.

     Jimmy hesitates, he wants to say something.  Sam waves him off.
     Jimmy gives Art a hard look and heads for the grass.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                         (to Art, nodding after
                          Jimmy)
                  What's left of my sailing class.

     Art studies the dock between his feet.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Talk to me Artie.

                                  ART
                  Kelly Van Ryan...

                                  SAM
                  ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told
                  me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...

                                  ART
                  Sam... I...
                         (a long beat)
                  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with
                  every member of the school board all day
                  long.  She's pushing for suspension...

                                  SAM
                  This is insane.

     Art shakes his head.

                                  ART
                  All I can tell you Sam, is hang in
                  there.  They clear you of this mess, you
                  get reinstated, with back pay...

                                  SAM
                  That's great.  I'll just tell my
                  creditors I'm not a rapist.  No
                  problem... Shit.
                         (beat)
                  I can't believe the board's going to act
                  without even hearing my side of it.

                                  ART
                  The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay.
                  They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan
                  calls up the board and says kiss my ass,
                  they say, left, right, or in the middle.
                         (beat)
                  You're gonna need some help on this one,
                  Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and
                  he'd better be a good one.

     EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

     Typical of its kind -- a Blockbuster Video, a 7-Eleven, half a
     dozen small businesses, one of which, sandwiched between a donut
     shop and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, bears the sign:  "KEN BOWDEN --
     ATTORNEY AT LAW."

     INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

     Sam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine.

     An attractive young SECRETARY sits a few feet away, behind her
     desk.  Her PHONE RINGS.  She picks it up, then turns to Sam,
     favoring him with a flirtatious smile.

                                  SECRETARY
                  Mr. Bowden will see you now.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Ken Bowden, a slightly oily-looking young man in a nice suit and
     a large, padded neck brace, rises to shake Sam's hand.

                                  KEN
                  Sam, hey, it's been a while.
                         (beat)
                  Looked for you at the ten year reunion.
                  You missed out.  Three days at the
                  Disneyworld Hotel... Partied ourselves
                  silly.

     Sam nods.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Couple of your old flames were there.
                  You remember Jill, with the knockers.

     Ken holds his hands out in front of his chest.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Blew up like the Goodyear blimp.

     Sam forces a smile.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  But check this...

                                  SAM
                         (interrupting)
                  Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an
                  attorney and you're the only one I know.
                  So I figured I'd start here.

     Ken stops, puts on a serious face.

                                  KEN
                  Well, I'm glad you did.  And I'm sorry.
                         (folding his hands before
                          him)
                  Why don't you tell me about it.

     Sam looks at him.  He starts to speak, then checks himself.

                                  SAM
                  What did you do to your neck?

     Ken puts a hand to his throat, as if aware of the brace for the
     first time.

                                  KEN
                  Oh this... chiropractor did a number on
                  me.

     He takes the brace off, tossing it on his desk.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  I don't really have to wear the thing
                  all the time.
                         (beat)
                 A guy from the insurance was here.

     Ken smiles.  Sam looks slightly ill.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Go ahead, Sam.  Shoot.  Let's see what
                  we've got here.

     EXT. A BLUE HAY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Trendy nouveau.  A valet parks Sam's Jeep.

     INT. RESTAURLNT - SAME

     Sam walks across a tiled entry.  He looks tired, but smiles at
     the maitre d'.

                                  SAM
                  Georgie, hey.  I'm meeting Barbara.  She
                  here yet?

     GEORGE looks stiff, maybe a little nervous.  Sam picks up on it.
     He scans the room...

     ANGLE ON ROOM

     Dimly-lit, crowded, but we PICK OUT Barbara, stunning in a
     delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table.

     Sam starts toward her.  George reaches out to touch his arm.

                                  GEORGE
                  Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish
     bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her
     father, Tom Baxter.

     Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet.

                                  BAXTER
                  This is not appropriate Lombardo.

     Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara.

     Barbara has tears in her eyes.  She looks at Sam, then shakes her
     head, looking away.

                                  SAM
                  Barbara...

                                  BAZTER
                  You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo.
                  You've been scratching at the door long
                  enough...
                         (as Sam faces him)
                  I ever see you around my daughter,
                  you're going to be finished, period.

     The two men square off, but already we can SEE Georgie, trailed
     by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way
     across the room.

     Sam sees them too.  He takes a final look at Barbara.  When she
     refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd
     and out of the restaurant.

     EXT. AN EVERGLADES ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

     Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room.  A handful of
     trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them.

     INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

     The air is thick with smoke.  Locals shoot pool.  The walls are
     decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish.

     An aging BARMAID -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a
     pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding...

     Sam, alone, awaiting service.

                                  BARMAID
                  Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a
                  while.  How's life treatin' you?
                         (off Sam's look)
                  That bad, huh?  Well, you came to the
                  right place.

     EXT. ROADHOUSE - LATER

     Sam walks outside.  He stands in the red glow of neon light,
     looking toward the road... On the opposite side of which...

     ... sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco
     bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel.

     Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness.

     Sam stares at the motel.  At last he gets in his Jeep.  As he
     EXITS the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     A deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp.  Trees bearded
     with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep.

     INT./EXT. SAM'S JEEP - MOVING - SAME

     San drives -- a tired face.  Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.

     Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the
     headlights.  Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...

     A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.

     Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of
     something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview
     mirror, coming fast.  Sam watches as the lights get closer.  He
     looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...

     Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him.  A black Range
     Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane,
     cutting him off.

     It happens quickly.  Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car,
     but the road affords little margin for error.

     The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a
     steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM
     BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.

     Sam slumps back from the steering wheel.  Somewhere over his head
     he can see headlights shining into the trees.

     He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down
     the embankment.

     Sam tries to get out of his seat harness.  Someone is
     approaching, splashing through the muck.  Suddenly a hand reaches
     through the broken driver's window, helping him.

                                  MAN'S VOICE
                  Are you all right?

     The hands get him loose.  Sam stumbles from the car.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, I'm okay.

     He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.

                                  FRANKIE
                  That's too bad.

     He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME.  What we are left with is
     the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the
     hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.

     Frankie is breathing hard.  We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the
     embankment.  We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away,
     leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.

     EXT. THE STRIP MALL - DAY

     Dazzling light.  Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken
     Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl.

     INT. BEEF BOWL - SAME

     Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken
     with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face.

                                  KEN
                  I figured, you know, it would be darker
                  in here.

     He moves a hand to his face.

                                  SAM
                  Good thinking.

                                  KEN
                  You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van
                  Ryan...

                                  SAM
                  Forget it.

                                  KEN
                  Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all
                  I'm saying.

                                  SAM
                  I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I
                  thought I might be able to save my
                  fucking house with an equity loan.
                  Guess who's on the board of directors at
                  the bank?

     He pauses to look at Ken Bowden.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Can't you take that stupid thing off?

                                  KEN
                  Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here
                  for lunch sometimes.

     San sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  You're not in bad shape, really.  I know
                  you think you are, but you're not.  Let
                  me tell you why.
                         (beat)
                  Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  SAM
                  What's that supposed to mean?

                                  KEN
                  For you to be getting this kind of heat,
                  for what they have on you... It doesn't
                  add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em
                  running scared.
                         (beat)
                  And I'll tell you something else, you
                  rush, you get careless.

     Ken reaches into his briefcase.  He pulls out some papers, tosses
     them on the table.  Sam picks one up, starts to read.

                                  SAM
                  Nellie Gail Ranch...

                                  KEN
                  Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab
                  farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went
                  when her morn fished her out of the
                  swamp.
                         (beat)
                  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year
                  I mean there's no way they can put
                  this thing in front of a jury.
                         (beat)
                  Shit, they haven't even taken your
                  statement yet.  Reason?  They're still
                  shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're
                  coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.

                                  SAM
                  There's nothing for them to get.

                                  KEN
                  Good.  So what we're going to do is
                  march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're
                  going to insist they take a statement.
                  We're going to tell them to charge your
                  ass or get off your back.
                         (beat)
                  They're walking a fine line here.
                  Defamation of character, malicious
                  prosecution...

                                  SAM
                  I just want my life back...

                                  KEN
                  Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.

     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Everyone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of
     Ray.  At this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at Sam.

                                  RAY
                  Why don't you tell us one more time, how
                  Kelly came to be with you, alone in your
                  house.

                                  SAM
                         (with growing impatience)
                  Story's the same, Detective...

     Ken pats him on the arm.  When Sam speaks again, it is in a
     calmer voice, calm but tired.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  I had to go look for this coupon.

                                  RAY
                  The one you bought at school.

                                  SAM
                         (nodding)
                  Like I said, I hadn't really expected to
                  use it.
                         (beat)
                  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I
                  hear a car.  I look out the window.  I
                  see Nicole driving away.  I leave my
                  room, and there's Kelly.

                                  RAY
                  In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.

                                  RAY
                  And she wanted to talk.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.

                                  RAY
                  But you can't tell us what she wanted to
                  talk about.

                                  SAM
                  I could, but it's confidential.  Look,
                  the point is, we didn't talk.  I told
                  her this was not an appropriate time or
                  place.

                                  RAY
                  And she began to cry.  And you put an
                  arm around her.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the
                  door.  I told her we would talk on
                  Monday, in the office.

                                  GLORIA
                  And when you turned her toward the door,
                  where did you expect her to go, without
                  a car?

                                  SAM
                  Again.  I think we covered this.  I told
                  her I was going to call a cab.

                                  RAY
                  But she ran away.

                                  SAM
                  That's right.

                                  GLORIA
                  Did you call anyone?  Did you call her
                  house to see if she got home?  Did you
                  call the Masons?

                                  SAM
                  No.

                                  GLORIA
                  Weren't you a little worried about
                  her...?

                                  SAM
                  There's a strip mall not half a mile
                  from my house.  There's phones there.  I
                  cruised the place, but I didn't see her.
                  I figured she was probably there but
                  that she was angry and didn't want to be
                  found.  I don't know... Maybe I should
                  have called.  But it's not like Kelly
                  can't take care of herself.  I figured
                  we'd just take it up on Monday, in the
                  office.

     There is a moment of silence in the room.

                                  RAY
                  But you do admit to touching her, to
                  putting your arm around her.  Isn't that
                  against the rules?

                                  SAM
                  It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...
                         (beat)
                  But, I mean... there's this kid standing
                  in front of you crying...

                                  RAY
                  With a thirty-five inch bustline in a
                  wet T-shirt with no bra...

     He is cut short as Sam shoves his chair back from the table.

                                  SAM
                  Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta
                  here.

                                  RAY
                  Sit down, Lombardo.

     Sam and Ray stare at one another.  Ken puts a hand on his
     client's arm.

                                  KEN
                  All right, all right... Enough.

     Ken stands up.  He walks to the two-way mirror set in one wall,
     rapping on the glass with his knuckles.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  We came down here to make a statement.
                  We've made it.
                         (beat)
                  If you're going to charge my client, do
                  it now.

     INT. OPPOSITE SIDE MIRROR ROOM - HUNTER

     stares at Ken's face, about a foot away.  Ken of course can't see
     him.  Hunter gives him the finger.

     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - KEN

     stares into the mirror, waiting.

                                  KEN
                  I didn't think so.
                         (to Sam)
                  Let's go.

     Ken opens the door.  Sam turns back to Ray and Gloria.

                                  SAM
                  I've spent the last ten years of my life
                  working with kids.  I love what I do,
                  and I think I'm good at it.
                         (beat)
                  These kids trust me, and there is no
                  way.  No way in hell I would ever betray
                  that trust.

     As Ken and Sam leave, Ray and Gloria are joined by Bryce Hunter.

                                  HUNTER
                  Nice speech.  Either of you buying?

     Ray shrugs.

                                  RAY
                  Not that stuff about her running away,
                  him trying to find her.  That's
                  bullshit.

                                  HUNTER
                  What about witnesses?

                                  RAY
                  We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard,
                  couple of kids playing hoops.

                                  HUNTER
                  And what do they say?

                                  GLORIA
                  Same as him.  They saw her come.  They
                  saw her go.  They saw him follow.

                                  RAY
                  Still doesn't explain why he couldn't
                  catch up with her.  I mean how long does
                  it take to put on a shirt?

     At which point, a COP APPEARS in the doorway.

                                  COP
                  Phone, Bryce.  It's Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  HUNTER
                  Christ Almighty.  That woman's calling
                  me six times a day.

     He starts away, then stops.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  I think you're onto something, Ray.
                  Stay with it.

     Hunter bangs out of the room.  Gloria slumps in a chair, tired,
     disgusted.

                                  GLORIA
                  We failed to mention the mower guy's a
                  drunk, that he was after more beer and
                  never really saw Kelly go into the
                  house, so he can't say how long she was
                  in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw
                  her running down the street, but that's
                  it.
                         (beat)
                  With no physical evidence, what do we
                  have?  Her word against his.

                                  RAY
                  You're telling me you believe the guy?

                                  GLORIA
                  All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van
                  Ryan push us too hard, we're going to
                  wind up looking stupid.

     Ray is paged by his BEEPER.  He pulls it off his belt, looks at
     the number.

                                  RAY
                  I'd better return this.

     Ray leaves.  Gloria pulls a cigarette from her purse and lights
     up, rests her head back in the chair, blowing smoke at the
     ceiling.

     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

     Gloria is grinding out the butt as Ray walks back in.  There is
     something in the way he carries himself, some sense of urgency.

                                  RAY
                         (off Gloria's look)
                  Seen any good gator wrestling lately?

     EXT./INT. DETECTIVES' CAR - MOVING - DAY

     Ray and Gloria drive through the Everglades, past marshlands
     punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees.

                                  GLORIA
                  They say it was old man Van Ryan planted
                  the melalucas to dry up the swamp.

     Ray nods.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  You can go up to one of those trees and
                  peel the bark.  You know what you get?
                  More bark.  And more bark.  There's no
                  core.  Tree's not good tar anything but
                  sucking up water.  And now they can't
                  get rid of them.  They've tried poisons.
                  Nothing works.  They don't die.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't
                  imagine he gives a shit now.

     Gloria just looks at him.  Ray stares into the dusty light of an
     approaching sunset.  At last he slows, turning off the highway
     and onto a narrow dirt road.

     A sign pokes out from the tall grass -- "SMILIN' JACK'S FISH
     CAMP."

     The Taurus bounces along the washboard road.

                                  GLORIA
                  You're sure we're not lost?

     They are driving now at the edge of a canal.

                                  RAY
                  You remember that little girl walked out
                  of our talk at Blue Bay?

                                  GLORIA
                  The skinny brunette.

                                  RAY
                  This is where she lives.  She wants to
                  talk.
                         (beat)
                  Beats the shit out of me why she would
                  call me at all.  I busted her once for
                  possession.  she wound up doing about
                  six months at Camp Nine.

                                  GLORIA
                  You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.

     Ray gives her a look.  Gloria shrugs.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  That's what they called it when I was in
                  Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.

                                  RAY
                  It's a shithole.  But she was dirty,
                  what was I gonna do?

     They pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run
     of shabby trailers and cheap shacks.

     The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of
     the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished
     brass beneath an immense, darkening sky.

     Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and
     peeling paint.  A sign reads:  "NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET."  The
     jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.

     As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye --
     along the bank of the canal...

     ANGLE ON BANK

     where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms
     kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.  The
     reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws.

     Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the
     gator's mouth.  The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a
     hollow snapping sound.

     Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps
     the creature once more.  This time moving round to the front of
     the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.

                                  VOICE (0.5.)
                  He's just showin' off for you now.

     Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up
     beside her.  The woman is in her sixties.  She's dressed in
     polyester.  Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to
     be anything but a dye job.  A cigarette bobs from her lips.

     Before Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than.

                                  RAY
                  Evening Ruby.
                         (beat)
                  I see you still got Walter.  I was sort
                  of hoping something had eaten him by
                  now.

                                  RUBY
                         (a long beat)
                  Can I help you with something?

     Ray and the old lady look at each other.

                                  RAY
                  Suzie called.  You know where we can
                  find her?

     Ruby looks toward the store.

                                  RUBY
                  You know the way.

     She watches as the detectives CROSS the road, then calls to them
     as they start up the steps.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  You won't shoot her will you?  I don't
                  believe she's armed.

     Gloria turns, surprised.  Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare,
     then opens the door for Gloria.

     INT. CAMP STORE - SAME

     It's dark inside.  The main light source is a tiny, beat-up
     black-and-white TV.

     Two elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old
     couch watching reruns of "Family Feud."  They look up as Ray and
     Gloria ENTER then EXIT through a door in the back.

     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - SAME

     Black walls.  Cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing.  A wire
     strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room.

     Suzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach,
     her thin, white arms crossed behind her head.

                                  SUZIE
                  Jesus.  It took you long enough.  What
                  if somebody was trying to strangle me?
                  Or fuck me in the ass, even?
                         (beat)
                  I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes.

     Ray manages a thin smile.

                                  RAY
                  Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.

                                  SUZIE
                  I did.  At Blue Balls.

                                  GLORIA
                  Seems to me you left early, before we
                  could meet.  But hi, Suzie.

     Gloria puts out a hand.  Suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of
     her own.

     As the women shake, Gloria looks at the book on Suzie's stomach,
     turning her head as if to read the title.

                                  SUZIE
                  It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a
                  pretty good line on what cheap fucks
                  people are.

                                  RAY
                  So Suzie, you called us, remember?

     Suzie takes a cigarette from a pack at her side, lights up, blows
     smoke at the ceiling.

                                  SUZIE
                  Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

     Ray and Gloria exchange looks.

                                  RAY
                  No.

                                  SUZIE
                  Will they?

                                  RAY
                  It doesn't look like it.

                                  SUZIE
                  Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?

     Ray shrugs.

                                  GLORIA
                  That bothers you?

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Yeah, maybe, a little.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why is that?

     Suzie lets out her breath.  She rests her head against the wall.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  You can talk to us, Suzie.  That's why
                  we're here...

     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Suzie, Gloria and Hunter sit at the conference table.  Ray
     operates the video cam.

                                  GLORIA
                  Okay, Suzie.  We want you to tell us
                  about the day Mr. Lombardo gave you and
                  Jimmy a ride.

       Suzie stares at the three cops around her, then at the camera.

                                  SUZIE
                  You didn't tell me you were gonna put me
                  on the fucking news.

                                  GLORIA
                  We need to tape the interview, Suzie.
                  No one will see it but us.
                         (beat)
                  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo
                  gave you the ride?

     Suzie stares at the camera.  She's lost the cockiness she had on
     her own turf.  She looks small, white and frail in the sterile
     room, surrounded by the detectives.

                                  SUZIE
                  About a year ago.

                                  GLORIA
                  He dropped Jimmy off first?

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah.

                                  GLORIA
                  And when he arrived at your house, was
                  anyone there?

                                  SUZIE
                  No.

                                  GLORIA
                  So you were alone.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yes.

                                  GLORIA
                  Did he come in with you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I guess.

                                  HUNTER
                  You guess?  Did he or didn't he?

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah... okay... he did

                                  HUNTER
                  And then what... he touched you?  Did
                  you maybe flirt a little...

                                  SUZIE
                  I wanna go home now.

     Gloria glares at Hunter, shakes her head.

                                  GLORIA
                  Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.  I
                  know it's harder to talk here than in
                  your room, but we need to get it on
                  tape.
                         (beat)
                  Just tell us what you told us before.
                  Tell us the truth.

     Suzie huddles in her skinny arms, studying the detectives.

                                  SUZIE
                  I didn't say a thing to him.  He just
                  put his arm around me.  Told me I was
                  pretty... I could be really pretty, he
                  said.

   Another moment -- she looks at Ray, then at Hunter.

                                  HUNTER
                  What did you do then?

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Shit, what difference does it make...
                  Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...

                                  HUNTER
                  Suzie!  Did this man rape you?

                                  SUZIE
                  Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the
                  floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I
                  go home?

     She stands up.

                                  GLORIA
                  At that point were you able to fight him
                  off?

                                  SUZIE
                  No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay?
                  That's all.  Let me go.

     Gloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around
     Suzie.  The girl jumps back as if she has been shocked.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Don't touch me.

     Gloria's hands fall to her sides.

     Suzie heads for the door.


     The detectives exchange looks.
         
     At which point, Suzie stops, turns to face the room.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  He did say something.

                                  GLORIA
                  What was that?

                                  SUZIE
                  He said, "No little bitch can ever make
                  me come."

                  Do you need more time?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  I know this is hard, Kelly, but I have
                  just one more question and even though

                                  KELLY
                  No.  He raped me on the floor of his
                  shitty house.

                                                 CUT TO:

     WITNESS WAITING ROOM - SAME - SUZIE

     still pacing, as Ray and Gloria ENTER the room.

     Suzie shoots them a nervous glance, drops her cigarette, bends to
     pick it up, burns her fingers, drops it again.  She curses
     beneath her breath, wrapping her fingers about her shoulders.

     Ray and Gloria watch her, exchange glances.  Gloria picks up
     Suzie's cigarette for her, puts it out in an ashtray.

                                  GLORIA
                  You've got nothing to be scared of,
                  Suzie, just take a deep breath.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     PANNING the spectators, we SEE Sandra, Baxter, Ray, Gloria.

     Hunter is on the witness stand.

     Suzie is in the box.  She looks pale, even more nervous.

                                  SUZIE
                  He pushed into me... I couldn't stop
                  him... it hurt.

                                  HUNTER
                  I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?

                                  SUZIE
                  Because... it was the biggest I've ever
                  seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way
                  through Jack's Fish Camp.

     Chuckling in the courtroom.  The JUDGE glares, silencing it.

                                  HUNTER
                  Ms. Toller, did Samuel Lombardo rape you
                  in your family's home on the 23rd of
                  April last year?

     Suzie glances at Sam, hesitates.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  Ms. Toller?

                                  SUZIE
                  I said he did.

                                  HUNTER
                  Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under
                  oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?

     Suzie looks around, as if for help.  The spectators stir.
     Ray rubs his eyes.  Gloria's are closed.

                                  SUZIE
                  This wasn't my idea.

                                  HUNTER
                  I'm sorry?

     Suzie looks at Sam once more.

                                  SUZIE
                  Look.  I just don't want to get into any
                  more trouble...

     Tom Baxter rises to his feet.  The Judge raises a hand, motioning
     him to sit back down.

                                 JUDGE
                         (to Baxter)
                  The Court would like to hear what Miss
                  Toller has to say.
                         (to Suzie)
                  Miss Toller.

                                 SUZIE
                  Mr. Lombardo didn't rape me.  He didn't
                  rape Kelly either.  He didn't do
                  anything.

     QUICK CUTS

     Hunter slumps back against the prosecution table.

     Sandra's hand covers her mouth.  Baxter mumbles a curse.

     Sam hangs his head in relief.  Ken grins above his neck brace.

     COURTROOM LOBBY

     The press corps scrambles for cameras.

     BLUE BAY HIGS

     Teachers, students, Art, Jimmy -- crammed around the TV.

                                  JIMMY
                  I don't believe it...

     IN THE COURTROOM

     Bryce Hunter and Tom Baxter are both on their feet, trying to
     make themselves heard above the din.

                                  HUNTER
                  Your Honor... I must object...

                                  JUDGE
                         (hammering for order)
                  I think I made it plain that the Court
                  intends to near Miss Toller's story.

     The Judge turns a cold eye on Suzie.

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm sorry.

                                  JUDGE
                  Sorry?  Just how far did you intend to
                  let this go?

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't know.  I just wanted to hurt Mr.
                  Lombardo.

     Sam looks up, confused.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  He was my friend at first.  Then I got
                  busted... he didn't even stick up for
                  me.  I had to go away to that hellhole.
                  It's like, you're his favorite, then who
                  cares?  You wanna know something?  When
                  Kelly said we should do this, I thought
                  cool, all these big shots screwing me
                  over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now
                  they're gonna get screwed.

                                  HUNTER
                  Your Honor... Please...

                                  JUDGE
                  Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter, and
                  the Court will hold you in contempt.
                         (to Suzie)
                  What you are telling me, Ms. Toller, is
                  that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible for
                  conceiving this entire charade...

                                  SUZIE
                  Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too.
                  She's in love with him.  I mean her
                  whole fantasy is him since her old man
                  died.  Then she found out that Mr.
                  Lombardo was doing her mom.  I mean that
                  was it...

     Gasps in the court as --

     Kelly BURSTS from the witness waiting room, trailed by a bailiff.

                                  KELLY
                  You stupid little bitch...

     She grabs the first thing she can get her hands on -- a glass of
     water from one of the tables and hurls it toward the witness
     stand before the bailiff can pin her arms against her sides.

     INT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER

     A mob scene.  Video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as
     Sandra and Baxter, with Kelly in tow, move toward a side door.

     Sam and Ken round a corner, followed by Ray and Gloria who walk
     on either side of Suzie.

     Kelly sees them.  She makes a run at Suzie.  For a moment the
     girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a
     hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of
     Kelly, pulling her toward the door.

     Ruby and Walter arrive now too.  Suzie runs to them and they lead
     her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long,
     tattooed arms.

     Gloria heaves a sigh.  Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then
     turns to find Sam looking at him.  Most of the press have run off
     to follow the girls -- looking for more action.  It is a quiet
     moment.  The two men lock eyes.

                                  SAM
                  I've found that adolescents make the
                  best liars.  They're old enough to be
                  good at it, but you want like hell to
                  believe them, because they're still
                  children.

     Ray just looks at him -- a hard stare.

     EXT./INT. KEN'S T-BIRD - DAY

     top down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue
     Atlantic on the other.

     Wind buffets Ken and Sam -- who has a dazed look.

                                  KEN
                         (hyped)
                  Come on, let loose!

                                  SAM
                  I was just thinking about where I'm
                  gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's
                  like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.

                                  KEN
                  You'll get over it. We've got a
                  knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a
                  lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  SAM
                  Just like that?

                                  KEN
                  Just like that?  These people ruined
                  your life, bro.

     Ken pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  I told you they were going overboard and
                  they did... They'll settle.  Believe me.
                  They'll be begging to settle...

     At which point Ken spots something up ahead.  His smile broadens.
     He swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as...

     The T-bird draws even with a sleek black limo.

                                  SAM
                  You don't think you're overdoing it?

     He pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of Sam's face,
     then tosses it out the window.

     INT. LIMO - MOVING - SAME

     Tom Baxter watches as the T-bird rockets off into the distance, a
     white piece of foam rubber bouncing across the road in its wake.

     A console TV is on -- news of the courthouse chaos.

     Sandra is next to Baxter.  Kelly is on the opposite bench seat.

                                  SANDRA
                  I hope you're going to nail his scrotum
                  to the nearest wall.

                                  BAXTER
                  That might have been a possibility, if
                  little miss not-so-bright here hadn't
                  started throwing things.

                                  KELLY
                  Fuck off.

   Sandra lunges to slap Kelly.  Baxter stops it in midair.

                                  BAXTER
                  See what I mean...

                                  SANDRA
                  You're going to let them get away with
                  this... this shit?  On the word of one
                  little white trash bitch...

                                  BAXTER
                  You like seeing your name in the papers?

     Sandra glares at him.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  Leave town, Sandy.  Go to your place in
                  St. Barts.  Let things cool down.

     Sandra concentrates on the TV.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  They'll try for twenty million.  The
                  cheaper the lawyer, the higher the
                  demand.

                                  SANDRA
                  You've got to be kidding.

                                  HAXTER
                  The man's life has been destroyed.
                  There will always be doubters, no matter
                  what happened in court.

                                  SANDRA
                  I'm not paying any idiot twenty million
                  dollars.

                                  BAXTER
                  I said that's what they'd ask for.

     Sandra stares from the window.  At last she turns to Kelly.
         
                                  SANDRA
                  I hope you're happy.

     Kelly seems to give this a moment's thought, then, smiling.

                                  KELLY
                  Ecstatic.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY

     Sam cruises slowly across the water in his junked-out air boat.
     He kills the engine, allowing the craft to glide to a stop.

     He's close to where he found the big gator -- the same shabby
     collection of whitewashed buildings we now RECOGNIZE as the
     Glades Motel, shimmers in the distance.

     Sam leans back, enjoying the silence.  He reaches into a cooler,
     takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something
     else from the cooler --

     -- a bundle of white butcher's paper.  Sam opens the paper, takes
     out raw meat -- something disgusting to look at -- big red turkey
     necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water.

     ANGLE ON WATER

     as the meat drifts down -- then, a sudden boiling, as -- quick as
     the strike of a snake -- the huge gator EMERGES, jaws wide, to
     snap up the morsel before slipping beneath the surface once mare.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

     Ken's Secretary opens the inner office door for Baxter.
     Ken rises from a desk to greet him.

                                  KEN
                  Tom Baxter.  Good to see you again.

                                  BAXTER
                  Let's cut the crap.  What does your
                  client want?

                                  KEN
                  Besides an apology?

                                  BAXTER
                  Unless you're planning on leaving Blue
                  Bay, there's gonna be other cases, other
                  days... You might want to keep that in
                  mind.

                                  KEN
                  Okay Tom.  My client wants your client
                  to saddle up... so we can ride her ass
                  all the way to the bank.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     A hot morning in June.  Shadows angle across the campus.

     Students line up at the old wooden pagoda, picking up caps and
     gowns.  A few turn, surprised to see...

     SAM LOMBARDO cross the parking lot, ENTERS a building.

     INT. ART'S OFFICE - ART

     working at his desk.  Sam's terrarium is behind him, his
     "Educator of the Year" Waterford bowl, a storage box of files.

     Art looks up at a KNOCK on the DOOR.  Sam walks into the room.
     It is a slightly awkward moment.

                                  SAM
                  Lizards don't seem to miss me.

     The two men smile, breaking the tension.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  How you doing, Artie?

                                  ART
                  I... You know... I...

     Sam waves him off.

                                  SAM
                  Take care of my lizards, Art.

     Art stands up.  The two men shake hands.

     OUTSIDE GUIDANCE OFFICE

     Sam comes out, then stops suddenly.

     Kelly waits for him.  Kirk and Nicole are with her.  A long
     moment.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly...

                                  KELLY
                  Drop dead... You know where my mom is
                  trying to get the money to pay you off?
                  She's trying to break my trust.  How do
                  you like that?  I can't touch it until
                  she's dead and she won't give me a dime
                  and now she's trying to break it to pay
                  you...

                                  SAM
                  Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what
                  you've been through... I should've seen
                  something like this coning.

     Art APPEARS in the door behind Sam.  Kelly cones closer.

                                  KELLY
                  Why don't you start fucking her again.
                  You can spend it together.

     Kirk tries to take Kelly's arm.  She jerks away, swings at Sam.

     He ducks, dropping the Waterford BOWL, which SHATTERS upon the
     floor.

     Kirk bear-hugs Kelly.  She throws a notebook at Sam.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  I hate you!

     She starts crying.  Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd
     gathers.

     Sam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.  Art bends to help
     him pick up the pieces.

                                  SAM
                  You see.  I couldn't stay, even if I
                  wanted to.

     EXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT

     Sam's Jeep is parked next to the T-bird and Jaguar.

     INT. KEN'S OFFICE - SAME

     Baxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers.
     At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment.

     Sandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room.
     Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam.

                                  FRANKIE
                  I'll be seeing you.

     Sam just looks at him.  The big man leaves.  Baxter closes his
     briefcase.

                                  KEN
                  So long, Tom.  Come by sometime.  We'll
                  have lunch at the Beef Bowl.

     Baxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile.

                                  BAXTER
                  I don't think you're gonna be eating at
                  the Beef Bowl anymore, kid.

     He EXITS.  Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk,
     drops into his chair, holds up the documents.

     Sam watches, smiling, finally.

                                  SAM
                  Thanks Ken, you did okay.

     Both men stand, they shake hands.  Ken claps him on the arm.

                                  KEN
                         (no clowning now)
                  Look, I know there's a part of you
                  wishes none of this had happened.  But
                  it did.  Now take the money and get out
                  of here.  Find a happy place.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     Moonlit fog -- the vast swamp.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     It's late.  A neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as...

     Sam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow.
     Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear.

     INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

     The neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old
     Venetian blinds.

     Sam ENTERS, puts the file box on the floor.  Arches a sore back.

     He reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's
     nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening...

     BZZZZZ -- the high-pitched WHINE of a MOSQUITO.  Then more -- a
     flurry of BZZZZZZZZS

     Sam frowns, sees...

     A cloud of mosquitoes circling him.

     He checks the front windows -- closed.  He goes around the bed.
     The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up
     on his right.  Ahead is a rear window -- wide open.

     Sam stops fast.
         
     Thinks.  Lets out a breath.

                                  SAM
                  Damn maid.

     He steps to the window.  He looks down --

     Muddy footprints.

     Sam freezes.  He whirls around --

     A sudden green FACE APPEARS in the big mirror -- like a nightmare
     image -- lit by the neon flash, then DISAPPEARS.

     Sam jumps back.

                                  SAM
                  Ahhhh!

     The neon green face flashes again in the mirror -- DISAPPEARS.
     Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way.

     Sam backs up, hits the wall.

     Kelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at
     her side, wrapped in a towel.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

                                  KELLY
                  So you got my mom's money.

     Sam tries to breathe, manages a nod.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  How much?

     Kelly prods him with the concealed object.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  How much?

                                  SAM
                  About six and a half million dollars.

     Kelly raises the abject covered by the towel, aims it at Sam.

                                  KELLY
                  Your turn to pay.

     A moment -- then she yanks the towel away to REVEAL --

     --  a two-foot-long novelty penis with giant balls.  Her hand
     grips the acrylic scrotum like the butt of a gun.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  King Dong!  That's you, Sam!

     She screams with joy, vaults into his arms, wraps those perfect
     thighs around him.  The dildo goes flying.  They fall on the bed.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  It worked!  We screwed the bitch!

     She's all over him now -- tongue kisses.

                                  KELLY CCONT'D)
                  It worked just like you said it would.

     He kisses her, finally gets her to sit, straddling him.

                                  SAM
                  God, you scared the shit out of me.  You
                  must be crazy coming here.

                                  KELLY
                  Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.

     She kisses him again, more passionately now.  He gets into it,
     tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts.

     A SHADOW moves on the wall, looming above them.  Sam sees it, his
     eyes widen.  He tries to sit up, as...

     BANG! -- an EXPLOSION.  Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side.

     A champagne cork hits the ceiling.

     Suzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle.

                                  SUZIE
                  How much is about six and a half million
                  divided by three?

                                  SAM
                  Jesus.  Two million one hundred
                  thirty-three thousand three hundred
                  thirty-three and change.

     Kelly screams in joy again.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Now calm down.  Both of you.

     The girls put on mock serious expressions.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  From now on, if we're seen together,
                  it's got to be accidental.  I thought
                  that was understood...

                                  KELLY
                  Hey, come on... We've got to have at
                  least one victory party.

     Kelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her
     breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them
     clean.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly, for christ's sake...

     She has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her
     breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch...

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  The only way we're gonna blow this now,
                  is if we do it ourselves...

                                  KELLY
                         (her hand in his crotch)
                  Do it to ourselves?

                                  SAM
                         (weakening)
                  We have to stick with the plan.

                                  KELLY
                  Stick?

     Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to
     get him inside her.

     Suzie watches.  She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle,
     pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple
     of tattoos, a pierced nipple.  She slips behind Kelly, fondling
     Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them
     totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex...

                                                 FADE TO:

     INT. DETECTIVZS' ROOM, BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     The room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk
     lamp, by which halo we find...

     Ray Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's
     printer finishes a job, as suddenly...

     ... a new light rushes into the room.  Ray turns to find Gloria
     standing in the doorway.  He stops as his printer finishes the
     job.  He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles.  Gloria walks
     to his desk.

                                  RAY
                  You saw the news today?

                                  GLORIA
                  Lombardo's settlement?

     Ray nods.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna
                  make us look stupid.

     Ray gives her a long look.  Gloria waits a moment, shrugs.

                                  RAY
                  Hey, don't back away from it, you were
                  right.  We did look stupid.
                         (beat)
                  What you were wrong about, is who made
                  us look that way.

     Gloria just looks at him, puzzled.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Think back, before the suit was filed,
                  before the trial.  Lombardo had an
                  affair with Sandra, right?
                         (Gloria nods)
                  So why not tell us about the affair?  I
                  mean it could be a hell of a motive for
                  Kelly to fabricate her charge in the
                  first place.

                                  GLORIA
                  Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the
                  affair for the trial.

                                  RAY
                  I thought of that.  Then I said, come
                  on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is
                  getting trashed.  You want to stop the
                  bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail
                  for three months.  Unless...

                                  GLORIA
                  Unless what?

                                  RAY
                  Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan
                  for the big payday.

     It is quiet in the office, save for the soft BUZZ of Ray's
     COMPUTER.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  They chumped us, Gloria, right from the
                  start.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty
                  good already, nice job in a beautiful
                  setting, popular, an active social life.
                         (beat)
                  He's gonna put this all on the line for
                  some dicey play like what you're
                  describing...

                                  RAY
                         (interrupting)
                  The job looks okay to us.  But look at
                  it from his point of view.  The man's
                  surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But
                  for him... it's just a reminder of what
                  should have been his.

     Gloria gives this a moment's thought.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Your old man graduates from Blue Bay
                  School, you're not supposed to wind up
                  there.  Board of Directors maybe, but
                  not in the lousy guidance office.  Now.
                  Point number two.
                         (he taps at the printout
                          on his desk)
                  I've run a financial on Lombardo.  Guy
                  was eyeball-deep in debt before this all
                  happened -- trying to keep up with
                  pricey trim like Barbara Baxter.

     He passes the printout to Gloria.  She looks at it, thinking.

                                  GLORIA
                  So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor,
                  but why would Kelly have to steal from
                  her own mother?  Surely her father...

                                  RAY
                         (interrupting)
                  Her father didn't leave her squat.  The
                  kid's got money in trust from her
                  grandfather, but she can't touch that
                  till her mother dies and Sandra seems to
                  have the idea that Kelly ought to learn
                  the value of a buck.

     Gloria looks over Lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on
     the desk, then studies Ray -- long beat.

                                  GLORIA
                  This one's got you working overtime,
                  hasn't it?

                                  RAY
                  I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's
                  dirty.  And I'll tell you something
                  else.  You want to know how old man
                  Lombardo lost his money?
                         (beat)
                  He was fucked out of it by old man Van
                  Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt
                  Creek Land Deal.
                         (beat)
                  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a
                  corporation to develop swamp land, got
                  investors like Lombardo to put up money,
                  then turned around and got the state to
                  declare the area an ecological preserve,
                  on the sly, of course, but everyone knew
                  it was him.  The freeway went to the
                  coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.

                                  GLORIA
                  Eliminate the competition.

                                  RAY
                  You got it.  The rich got richer.  While
                  the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in
                  the swamp.

     Gloria looks at him a long moment.

                                  GLORIA
                  Where'd you come up with this stuff,

                         (a long beat; then
                          beneath a smile)
                  I net a guy in a bar.

     EXT. A BANK, BLUE BAY - DAY

     Sam walks down the steps, gets into his Jeep, and drives away.

     Across the street -- the white Taurus -- Ray and Gloria watch.

     EXT. YACHT BROKERAGE - DAY

     Sam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone.

     Ray Duquette steps INTO FRAME, turns into the brokerage.  The
     door swings shut behind him.

     INT. SWIMMING POOL, BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off.  As the girls begin
     to walk toward the lockers, they encounter...

     Ray Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on...

     Kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision.

                                  RAY (O.S.)
                  Nice stroke.

     Kelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the
     deck.  She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and
     begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her.

                                 KELLY
                  Is there some reason why you're here?

                                 RAY
                  Curiosity, I guess.

                                 KELLY
                  About what?  How to improve your breast
                  stroke?

     Ray gives her a cold smile.

                                 RAY
                  Actually, I was curious about how you
                  see things working out, for you, Sam and
                  Suzie.

     This appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation.

                                  KELLY
                  Excuse me?

                                  RAY
                  You all gonna go down to the Caribbean
                  together?

     Kelly looks around the pool area.  A number of girls are watching
     from a corner of the deck, but no one is close enough to hear.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  The thing about it is, threesomes so
                  rarely work out.

                                  KELLY
                  You're out of your mind.

                                  RAY
                  I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.
                         (beat)
                  It's hard enough for one person to keep
                  a secret, let alone three.  And then
                  there's the love angle.  I mean do you
                  and Sam really want that little
                  pill-head around, now that you have the
                  money?

     Kelly starts to walk away.  Ray cuts her off.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea
                  right up front, of whacking Suzie?
                  That's murder, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                  Police -- God -- get a life.

     She moves around him and walks calmly away.

                                  RAY
                         (loud enough to make
                          himself heard)
                  You're good.  But you don't think that
                  little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together,
                  do you?

     Kelly continues to walk, her face giving nothing away, as Ray's
     WORDS ECHO over the pool.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LONG SHOT - LATER

     Only a few cars left -- one of them Suzie's old VW bug, at the
     side of which Kelly and Suzie engage in heated conversation.

     CLOSER - SUZIE

     paces around Kelly.

                                  SUZIE
                  You don't know Duquette.  I'm the one he
                  busted... He's a fucker, man... He'll
                  fuck us both over...

     Kelly tries to take her by the arm.  Suzie jerks away.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I'm not going back to that prison.
                  That's what it was... a fucking hell
                  hole...

     Kelly looks around the lot.  She takes Suzie by the arm once
     more, this time more firmly, pulling Suzie to her.

                                  KELLY
                  Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna
                  come to you just like he did to me.
                  You're gonna have to be ready for him.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah, but he can't push you around like
                  he can me.  You've got family and
                  they've got clout.  With we it's
                  different... with me...

                                  KELLY
                         (circling her with her
                          arm)
                  Yeah, I've got family and they've got
                  clout and now you have me.  Right?  And
                  Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's
                  not going to send you anywhere.  He's
                  gonna try and rattle your cage, and
                  that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do
                  shit.

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Man, I wanna smoke a joint.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL -- in the distance -- the white Ford Taurus
     at the side of the road leading to the school.

     The car is pulled just far enough off the road to be mostly
     hidden among pampas grass and oleander, but angled in such a way
     as to afford a view of the two girls now hugging in the lot.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - NIGHT

     Suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a joint.  At her back a
     few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of
     trailers.  She walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail,
     takes another hit.

                                  VOICE (0.S.)
                  'Evening, Suzie.  How was school today?

     Suzie freezes, holds back her exhale, looking around...

     A shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock.  A man
     stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs.  The light from a
     trailer across the road glances off steel-rimmed glasses as Ray
     Duquette steps onto the dock.

     Suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs.  She squeezes the
     lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal.

                                  RAY
                  You ought to watch it with that shit,
                  Suzie.  You get busted again, you go
                  back in a two-tine loser.

                                  SUZIE
                  You got something against cigarettes?

     Ray just laughs at her.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, they're bad for your health.
                         (beat)
                  I'm tryin' to look out for you...

                                  SUZIE
                  That's cop bullshit.

                                  RAY
                  Well, you're half right.  Best thing you
                  could do for yourself right now would be
                  to talk to me.

                                  SUZIE
                  About what?

                                  RAY
                  Every triangle I've ever seen never
                  lasts.  Somebody's got to go.

                                  SUZIE
                  Is this supposed to mean something to
                  me?  What triangle?

                                  RAY
                  You, Kelly, Sam.

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't have to listen to this.  And you
                  can't shove me around.  I have friends
                  now...

     She catches herself, falters.

     Ray laughs once more.

                                  RAY
                  Is that what you think?  You have
                  friends?  Is that what they told you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't mean who you're thinking.  I
                  have other friends...

                                  RAY
                  Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're
                  talking to.  We both know you don't have
                  shit, never have had shit, never will
                  have shit...

     He takes a sheet of paper from his coat.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Here, Suzie.  I want you :o look this
                  over.  Know what it is?
                         (as Suzie takes it)
                  Sam deposited his check, transferred the
                  funds to an offshore bank, a numbered
                  account.  Not even the cops can find out
                  whose names are on it.  Think one of
                  them's yours?

     Suzie looks over the paper.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  He also put a down on some island
                  property, and a lease-to-buy on a
                  forty-foot sailboat.  You're into
                  sailing, aren't you, Suzie?

     Suzie thrusts the paper back at Ray.

                                  SUZIE
                  Get away from me.

                                  RAY
                  Don't you see what this means?  You
                  really think Sam and Kelly are gonna
                  give you a third of the money?  You, the
                  pill-head with the rap sheet?

                                  SUZIE
                  Shut up.

     Ray smiles at her.  He moves up close.

                                  RAY
                  You know, I don't think I ever told you
                  I was sorry about your little friend...
                  What was his name?

     Suzie tries to back away.  She bumps against the rail.  Ray
     reaches out, takes her hand in both of his.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Come on, Suzie, help me out here.  You
                  know his name.

     Suzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before.  When she speaks
     her voice is scarcely above a whisper.

                                  SUZIE
                  Davy.

                                  RAY
                         (nodding, a scary smile)
                  That's right.  That was his name.

     The smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still
     holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Sometimes I wonder if you're really as
                  dumb as you pretend to be.

     He looks into Suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to REVEAL the
     burn mark on her palm.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  But you know what?  I'd be keeping a
                  clear mind right now if I were you.
                         (beat)
                  I'd hate to see you come to a bad end.
                  Like Davy did.

     He holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it.  He goes back
     down he steps to the little skiff.  An outboard MOTOR STARTS in
     the night.

     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Suzie cones in fast, grabs the phone, punches out a number.

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                         (answering machine)
                  This is Sam.  I'm not in right now...

     EXT./INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

     parked behind some cottonwoods in a small launch area where the
     highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp.

     The skiff has been shoved into the bed.  Ray sits at the wheel.
     He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then
     starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired ENGINE, looks up to see...

     HEADLIGHTS

     Suzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the
     highway.

     RAY'S TRUCK - RAY

     watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the
     highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug.

     SXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     Suzie's VW idles.  She leans out the window, talks to the
     intercom, the gate opens.  The VW ENTERS.  The gate closes.

     Ray's pickup drives past.  He drives to a big lot where one of
     the mansions has been torn down.  He drives up onto the dirt,
     keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his
     little skiff out of the back once more.

     He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a
     Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm
     waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, REAR OF MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

     Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on
     toward the jacuzzi.  The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white.

     Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body.  Suzie, the contrast --
     pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans.  They
     argue -- we CANNOT HEAR.

     EXT. THE BAY - SAME

     Ray has arrived near the docks.  He has killed his engine,
     maneuvering here with a single oar.  He ties the skiff off behind
     the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest
     house and coming close to the pool.  He takes a position behind
     the cabanas, readies his camera.

     EXT. POOL AREA - SAME

     Kelly and Suzie continue their argument in front of the jacuzzi.

                                  KELLY
                  I can't believe you called Sam.  What's
                  the matter with you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared
                  there's no one to trust.

                                  KELLY
                  You can trust me.

     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the patio chair.  Kelly and Suzie are
     startled by it.  Kelly answers.

     INT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

     The bedside lamp is on.  Sam is on the phone.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly.  Is Suzie there?

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  Yes.

                                  SAM
                  Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left
                  this garbled message on my machine.
                         (beat)
                  Can you calm her down?

                                  KELLY (V.0.)
                  Why can't you come...

                                  SAM
                  No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm
                  counting on you.  You calm her down.
                  I mean do whatever you have to, whatever
                  it takes...

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  You know what it takes.

                                  SAM
                  Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly.
                  Do it tonight.  We'll figure something
                  out... Okay?

     EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT

     Kelly glances across the steamy water at Suzie.

                                  KELLY
                  Yeah, right.  Can you at least talk to
                  her, on the phone?

     NT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME

     Sam lies on his bed, waits for Suzie's voice on the line.

                                  SUZIE (V.O.)
                  Sam...

                                  SAM
                  Put Kelly on too.

     EXT. JACUZZI - SAME

     The girls stand cheek-to-cheek, the phone between them.

                                  KELLY
                  I'm here.

     INT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  I want you to hear this too.
                  We've got to be cool.  All of us.
                  People think I'm rich, for Christ's
                  sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.
                         (beat)
                  I'm spending my money.  It's more
                  suspicious if I sit around doing
                  nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck
                  with your minds.

     EXT. CABANAS - NIGHT

     Ray tapes the scene.

     The girls still hold the phone.

                                  SUZIE
                  But I..

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                  Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only
                  people who can blow this is us.
                  Remember?

                                  KELLY
                  Right.

     Suzie says nothing.  Kelly nudges her.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah, right.

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                  Good.  Just keep telling yourselves
                  that, the only people who can fuck this
                  up is us.

     The line goes dead.  Kelly hangs up.  Suzie stares into the
     jacuzzi.

                                  SUZIE
                  You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?

                                  KELLY
                  Oh, for Christ's sake.

                                  SUZIE
                  You are.

                                  KELLY
                  Are you retarded, or just brain dead
                  from whiffin' fumes out there in the
                  swamp...

     Suzie's face goes hard.

                                  SUZIE
                  That's what I am to you, isn't it?
                  Swamp trash.  It's what I am to
                  everybody, just like my mom...

     Kelly tries to put an arm around her.  Suzie slaps her -- a
     mistake -- Kelly's bigger, faster.  She slaps the side of Suzie's
     head, then grabs her legs, dumping her on the tile deck.

     ON RAY

     focusing the camera.

     Suzie tries to kick Kelly.

     Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage.

                                  KELLY
                  Stupid bitch.

     She very methodically grabs Suzie's hair, dragging her into the
     jacuzzi, holding her under the hot water.

     Suzie thrashes, breaks free, gags, arches out of the water, the
     wet T-shirt clinging to her small breasts.

     Kelly is on her again, slaps her, puts her hands to Suzie's
     throat -- violently sexual in her wet bikini.

     Kelly slams Suzie back onto the black-and-white tile, gets on top
     of her, knees between Suzie's legs, her hands on her throat.

     Suzie's skinny shape writhes underneath Kelly on the gleaming
     tile.  She gasps for air.  Kelly finally lets go, but remains on
     her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard.  A moment.  Kelly
     touches Suzie's face.

                                  KELLY
                  Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like
                  you want it or something.

     Suzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  God, you are scared, aren't you?

     Suzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her T-shirt
     up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  And this is going to make you feel
                  better, make you trust me...

     Suzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands
     onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to
     pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges...

     Suzie cries out in pain.  Kelly's hands move down to pull off
     Suzie's bottoms...

     ON RAY

     still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching.

     As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands
     slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves
     to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them...

                                                 CUT TO:

     VIDEOTAPE

     Kelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL --

     INT. POLICE ROOM - DAY

     Gloria, Ray, Hunter watch the tape.  Hunter's seen enough.  He
     slams the stop/tape.

                                  HUNTER
                  Are you crazy, Ray?

                                  RAY
                  You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was
                  Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the
                  girls...

                                  HUNTER
                  Ray.  The conversation on this tape is
                  totally unintelligible.
                         (beat)
                  What we have here, is you on the Van
                  Ryan property, without a proper warrant,
                  shooting a porn flick...

                                  RAY
                  I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A
                  month ago you were pulling these two
                  apart at the courthouse.
                         (beat)
                  They were acting.  They were all acting,
                  from the beginning.  And we bought it,
                  hook, line and sinker... And now they're
                  home free with six million of Sandra Van
                  Ryan's money.

                                  GLORIA
                  Which she might have saved, if she
                  hadn't set out to destroy the man's
                  life.

                                  RAY
                         (turning now on Gloria)
                  What?  You wouldn't go after some guy
                  you thought raped your daughter?
                         (beat)
                  Cone on.  She bought the same story we
                  did...

     Ray stops as Hunter brings the palm of his hand down on the table
     a loud SLAP.

                                  HUNTER
                  Listen, both of you.  You're not on a
                  case.  There is no fucking case.
                         (beat)
                  I've had it up to here with Sandra Van
                  Ryan.  Ray, you keep mucking around like
                  this and you are going to have her suing
                  us for invasion of privacy.  Get out of
                  these people's lives.
                         (beat)
                  Am I getting through on this?

     Ray walks to the door, jerks it open --

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer.

     Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes.

                                  HUNTER
                  Oh, Ray... no...

                                  RAY
                  You think this is just about money,
                  about us looking foolish?  Question him.
                  You're gonna find a stone cold
                  manipulative psychopath.  And those
                  girls are going to wind up dead...

     Sam lunges at Ray.  The officer and Hunter restrain him.  Gloria
     looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response.

                                  HUNTER
                  Mr. Lombardo, please.  I'm sorry about
                  this.

                                  SAM
                  Give this idiot something to do.  Let
                  him look into the Kennedy assassination.

     Ray flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they
     can be separated once again.

                                  SAM (CCNT'D)
                         (to Hunter)
                  Next time this guy drags me down here,
                  I'll sue you.  You're goddamn lucky I
                  didn't sue you the first time!

     Sam storms from the room, followed by Hunter.  Ray stares after
     them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself.

                                  RAY
                  Guess I kind of lost it there.

                                  GLORIA
                  You could say that.

                                  RAY
                  Were you ever in a situation where you
                  could see a thing coming and you didn't
                  do what you could to stop it?

     Gloria studies Ray, clearly concerned.

                                  GLORIA
                  We all have...

                                  RAY
                  I mean something bad, Gloria, something
                  bad you saw coning, and you didn't do
                  anything, and then it happened.
                         (off Gloria's silence)
                  I did that once.  I don't want to do it
                  again.

     EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

     Sam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath
     his arm.  He looks toward the parking lot where --

     Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.  She tips a valet
     then starts toward the mall.  She sees San.  Their eyes meet.  A
     moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.

                                  SAM
                  You look pretty.

                                  BARBARA
                  Thanks.

     Sam smiles.  She points to the stuff beneath his arm.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  Quite a shopping spree...

     She's kidding, then seems to consider how Sam might take it.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  I didn't mean...

     Sam laughs it off.

                                  SAM
                  Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend
                  it, right?  I've always wanted to live
                  where I could dive for my dinner.

                                  BARBARA
                  And where might that be?

                                  SAM
                  I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

                                  BARBARA
                  I love Antigua.
                         (beat)
                  Maybe I'll come visit you.

                                  SAM
                  I'd like that.

     A moment, she touches his face.  Sam raises a hand to cover hers,
     as...

     ... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above
     the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.

     INT. RANGE ROVER - KELLY VAN RYAN

     seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance.

     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

     Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand.  Barbara
     leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips.

     CLOSE ON KELLY

     lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of
     ENGINE NOISE.  She turns to find...

     Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her.

     Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in.  She's wearing a
     black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag.  As she settles in
     the seat, she lets out a long breath.

     Kelly makes a face, fans the air.

                                  KELLY
                  Jesus.  What are you drinking?

     Suzie laughs, pulls a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 from the bag.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                         (looking at the bottle)
                  Anybody ever tell you that stuff will
                  rot your brain?

                                  SUZIE
                  What brain?

     Suzie takes a big drink.  Kelly shakes her head, looks back
     toward the entrance.

     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

     empty.  Sam and Barbara are gone.

     Kelly continues to stare.

                                  SUZIE
                  What are you looking at?

                                  KELLY
                         (starting the car)
                  Nothing.

     EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

     The Atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the
     last red light drains from the sky.

     The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks.

     INT./EXT. RANGE ROVER - SAME

     Kelly turns off the engine.  Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the
     MD 20/20.  She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast.

                                  SUZIE
                  I thought we were goin' to a movie.

                                  KELLY
                  I think we just need to get wasted.

     Suzie shrugs, gets out.  Kelly gets out with her.  Suzie
     staggers.  Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around,
     begins leading her down the beach.

                                  SUZIE
                  I wanna live at the beach someday.

                                  KELLY
                  Shit.

     She stops walking.  Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to
     look at her.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  I left the keys.  I'll get 'em.

     Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.  She
     watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath
     her breath, then lies on her back.

     SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY

     The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.  She rolls to one side, looking down
     the beach

     Murky blackness.

     She tries to focus, sits up.

                                  SUZIE
                  Kelly?

     She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.

     A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Kelly?

     The shape gets closer and closer, until...

     Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.

     She takes a step back.

     Sam puts a hand on her shoulder.  He carries something in his
     other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.

                                  SAM
                  Suzie, it's okay.  It's me.

     Suzie steadies herself.  A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  I was worried about you, Suzie.  I
                  decided we should all get together, one
                  more time, before we split up.

                                  SUZIE
                  Are you mad at me?

                                  SAM
                  No, no.  Look, I probably should have
                  told you a little more, about the part I
                  intended to play.
                         (beat)
                  We'll go through it all again tonight.

     Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  This is a celebration Suzie, not a
                  suicide pact.

     He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  We'll chill out first, have a drink,
                  watch the stars.

     Suzie nods.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the
                  Jeep.  Could you get it for us?

     Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as...

     Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Let me tell you about this boat I picked
                  out for us...

     They move OUT OF SIGHT.  Kelly continues to walk, back along the
     sand toward the cars.

     INSERT - A SCREAM

     A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall
     silently on dark stone.

     Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep,
     where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the
     seats.  She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the
     beach.  As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS --
     it seems like forever

     Sam APP£ARS before her on the sand.  The champagne bottle swings
     loosely at the end of one arm.  it looks shiny now, dripping with
     Suzie's blood.

     Kelly goes to him.  She looks at the bottle, then throws herself
     against him -- a hard kiss.

                                  SAM
                  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to
                  happen like this.  She was losing it...

                                  KELLY
                         (breathless)
                  There was no way.  That cop would've
                  gotten her to tell him... everything.
                  She was weak and dumb...

     She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.  Sam takes
     a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry
     eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at
     which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he
     can into the black waves.

     EXT. RANGE ROVER ON THE SAUD - LATER

     Rear hatch open -- overhead light on.

     Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to
     the rear hatch.  As they heft her inside, the light catches --

     SUZIE'S FACE

     A mask of blood.

     Kelly turns away in disgust.  She goes to the passenger side
     door, gets in.

     Sam gets in behind the wheel.  For a moment the two of them just
     sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their
     own BREATHING.  Sam looks at Kelly.

     She is focused on the dark Atlantic.

                                  SAM
                  Are you okay?

     Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face.

                                  KELLY
                         (a long beat)
                  My mom would kill me if she knew I took
                  the Rover.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes.

     SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in
     waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.

     EXT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Almost empty of cars.  The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's VW,
     circles, comes back.  Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets
     into the VW and backs it out.

     EXT. BUS TERMINAL (MIAMI) - DAY

     Almost dawn.  A long parking lot fronts the terminal.  Suzie's VW
     arrives, parks, Sam gets out.  He goes to the waiting Range
     Rover, gets in and drives away.

     EXT. FRONT GATE - VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY

     A THIN STREAM OF MUDDY WATER

     flows beneath the gate, down the drive, toward the street.

     A HAND touches the water.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL the hand as that of Ray Duquette.

     EXT. VAN RYAN DRIVEWAY - SAME

     Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens,
     looking toward the house where...

     On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight
     shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover.  She looks up, sees...

     Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive,
     arriving at the wrought-iron gates.

                                  RAY
                  Been four-wheelin'?

     Kelly freezes -- not so cool this time.

                                  KELLY
                  Get off my property.

                                  RAY
                  I'm not on your property!

     He grabs the wrought-iron gate -- rattles it -- harder and
     harder.

     Kelly backs away, frightened.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     Gloria and Ray stand in front of the ramshackle wooden building,
     talking to Ruby.  Walter sits nearby, sharpening a knife.

                                  RAY
                  You say she didn't come back last night.

                                  RUBY
                  She's been sayin' she was going to go to
                  L.A.  But I don't know.  I mean all her
                  clothes are still here.  An' she's
                  missin' her graduation.
                         (a long beat)
                  She should graduate.  She's a smart
                  girl...

     Ray nods.  He makes a note in his pad.

                                  RAY
                  May have been she just partied too
                  much... But we'll look into it.  We find
                  something, you'll be the first to know.

     Ray turns and walks to the car.  Gloria follows.

     INT. CAR - SAME

     Ray sits for a moment behind the wheel.

                                  RAY
                  It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it
                  begins...

                                  GLORIA
                  Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She
                  could be anywhere...

     Ray silences her with a look.

                                  RAY
                  I'm gonna take you back to the office.
                  Will you put out a call on Suzie's car
                  for me?

                                  GLORIA
                  You have someplace to be?

     Ray starts the car, doesn't answer.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  If you want company...

                                  RAY
                  Just check out the car.

     Gloria nods.  She looks toward the camp store where the old lady
     can still be SEEN standing on the porch, beneath the jawbones.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Caps and gowns -- kids and parents on the lawn -- taking photos.

     Kelly poses with Sandra.  Tom Baxter aims the camera.

                                  BAXTER
                  Smile.

     Kelly and Sandra force miserable smiles.  CLICK.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  That's one for the scrapbook.

     Baxter moves away, greets Nicole and her parents.

     Kelly puts some room between her and Sandra.

                                  KELLY
                  You didn't have to fly back -- from --
                  wherever, for me...

                                  SANDRA
                  I'm here to congratulate my friends and
                  their children.  I'm leaving again
                  tonight.

                                  KELLY
                  Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.

                                  SANDRA
                  Where, the mall?

                                  KELLY
                  A friend of mine bought a boat.

     Sandra shakes her head, walks off.

     Kelly turns away, freezes, as she catches sight of --

     Ray talking with Jimmy.

     EXT. THE BEACH - DAY

     Ray and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the
     big rocks.  Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer T-shirt.  Ray
     wears a suit.  He carries the coat over his shoulder.

                                  JIMMY
                  It's those rocks, up there.

                                  RAY
                  You and Suzie used to come out here
                  together?

                                  JIMMY
                  Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang
                  out here.
                         (beat)
                  You really think something bad happened
                  to Suzie?

                                  RAY
                         (ignoring the question)
                  Lombardo ever come out here?

     Jimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that Ray is serious.  Still,
     the idea generates a laugh.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  I say something funny?

                                  JIMMY
                  No.  But I mean... just the idea that
                  Mr. Lombardo would...

                                  RAY
                  Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with
                  the kids, one of the guys...

                                  JIMMY
                  Yeah, but...

     He breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock.  Ray brushes
     away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking
     tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets.

     Jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees.

     CLOSE ON GLOVED HANDS

     as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone.

     Ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand.

     Jimmy stares at the teeth.

     Ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy.

                                  RAY
                  I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy.
                  You can catch a bus up there at the lot,
                  okay?

     Jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money.  He starts
     toward the lot.

     Ray watches for a moment.  Then calls out to him.

                                  RAY
                  People aren't always what they appear to
                  be, kid.  Remember it.

     Jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying,
     clearly disturbed by the implications.  But he asks no more
     questions.  He turns, trudging alone back through the sand.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. OCEAN COVE - LATER

     THE TEETH go into a plastic bag.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     Black-and-whites, county cars -- police tape across the site.

     Ray, Gloria and Hunter watch as DAVE MERRITT, a forensic expert
     bags the teeth.  He passes the bag to Ray, then bends to the
     rocks where he begins to take a blood sample.

                                  RAY
                  Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here.

     Hunter and Gloria exchange a look.

                  Two kids could've gotten into a fight,
                  lost a couple of teeth.

                                  RAY
                  Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.

                                  GLORIA
                  Where's the body?

                                  RAY
                  The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a
                  swamp rat, knows the body will never be
                  found there.  But he's made a mistake.

     He holds up the evidence bag containing the teeth.

                                  GLORIA
                  Her grandmother said she'd been
                  threatening to run away.  And I found
                  the car at the Miami bus terminal.

                                  RAY
                  You don't think Sam could've put it
                  there?

                                  HUNTER
                  Dust it for prints.  My guess is, if
                  anybody murdered Suzie it was probably
                  that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan.

     Ray shakes his head; he turns to Dave, still working.

                                  RAY
                  How soon can we get something?

                                  DAVE
                  We can get blood type right away.
                  Dental records will take longer.  You
                  want DNA, that can take weeks.

     Ray nods, looks out to sea.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.

                                  GLORIA
                  We don't know that, Ray...

     Ray turns to her -- an intense look.

                                  RAY
                  Kelly's next, Gloria.

                                  HUNTER
                         (ice cold)
                  Get off this Ray, now.
                         (beat)
                  If there is any evidence here, it's for
                  Homicide.
                         (turning to Dave)
                  You get an ID, you call me.

     Dave nods.  Hunter stalks off toward his car.  Ray turns to
     Gloria.

                                  RAY
                  Will you do me one favor?

                                  GLORIA
                  Ray, you heard him...

                  What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm
                  right and Hunter's wrong?
                         (beat)
                  What do you do if you see a bad thing
                  coming?

     Gloria looks toward the highway, trying to decide.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need

                                  GLORIA
                  And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll

                  If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a
                  promise.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - SUNSET

     Sam's Jeep -- a "FOR SALE" sign in the window -- sits in the lot.

     Across the road -- Gloria sits in the white Taurus.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, MAIN GATE - SUNSET

     Ray sits in his truck, picks up his cellular, punches in a
     number.

                                  DAVE (V.O.)
                         (speaker)

                                  DAVE (V.0.)
                  Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the

                                  RAY
                  What about the blood?

                                  DAVE (V.0.)
                         (a beat)
                  Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a
                  lot of other people's too...

                                  RAY
                         (cutting him off)
                  Second you get something on those teeth,
                  I want it

     Ray hangs up without waiting for a reply.  He turns to the Van
     Ryan house, an orange light slanting across its facade.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     Gloria waits in her car.  She looks toward the motel.

     Sam's Jeep is parked before one of the bungalows.  There is a
     light on in the room.  We can SEE inside.

     Gloria sighs, picks up a pair of binoculars and trains them on
     the room.

     ANGLE ON ROOM - GLORIA'S POV

     Suitcases and boxes are stacked everywhere.  Sam, bare-chested,
     in khaki slacks, moves about the room.

     CLOSE ON GLORIA

     watching Sam, as...

     IN THE ROOM

     The PHONE has begun to RING.  Sam looks at it until it stops,
     then picks it up and dials a number.  Kelly answers.

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  Hello?

                  God, I've been calling you.

     INTERCUT - KELLY/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION

     Kelly is in the guest house, pacing in front of the gun case.

                                  KELLY
                  I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps
                  watching me.

                                  SAM
                  Duquette.  Forget him...

                                  KELLY
                  I can't help it.  He gives me the
                  creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared
                  of him?  She's not that way.  I think he
                  did something...

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, he got her busted for
                  possession...

                                  KELLY
                  I don't know... I think it was something
                  else... Suzie says the bust was
                  bullshit...

                                  SAM
                  And you believe her?

                                  KELLY
                         (a long beat -- a sigh)
                  I don't know.
                         (beat)
                  I want to see you...

                                  SAM
                  Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's
                  valium or something.  In another week
                  you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're
                  rich.

                                  KELLY
                  But what if they find out... God, they'd
                  put you in the gas chamber...

     Sam is about to respond, then looks out the window, sees...

     ACROSS THE STREET, the white Taurus.

                                  SAM
                  So if they're tapping your phone, we're
                  dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip
                  the graduation parties.  You'll never
                  see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.

                                  KELLY
                         (beat)
                  Okay.  I love you too.

     INT. TAURUS - SAME - GLORIA

     sees the light go out in Sam's room, lowers her binoculars, sits
     for a moment, then begins to write something on a pad.

     She's still at it when something KNOCKS at a FENDER.  She looks
     up, startled, to find...

     Sam in the street, still shirtless, his arms and shoulders
     back-lit by the neon light of the Glades Motel.

                                  SAM
                  Isn't that against the law, peeking into

                  Suzie Toller is missing.

     Sam lets out his breath, shakes his head.

                                  SAM
                  How long?

                                  GLORIA
                  She didn't cone home last night.  We
                  found her car at the bus terminal, but
                  nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.

                                  SAM
                  Maybe she used another name.

                                  GLORIA
                  Ray thinks she was murdered.

     Sam shakes his head once more.

                                  SAM
                  I don't know what to say...

                                  GLORIA
                  You could tell me where you were last
                  night.

     Sam stares at her.

                                  SAM
                  Goddannit... I don't have to...

     He stops himself, calms down.

                                  SAM
                  Come here.  I want you to see something.

     Gloria hesitates, looks up at Sam, then puts down the phone and
     opens her door.

     INT. GLADES MOTEL - SAME

     Sam and Gloria walk among the boxes and suitcases.

                                  GLORIA
                  Looks like goodbye.

     Sam nods.  He goes to one of his cardboard filing boxes, pulls
     out a file, hands it to Gloria.  As she takes it, he goes to the
     closet, takes a shirt from a hanger.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to
                  find an angry, sexually confused girl
                  who's made threats on her mother's life
                  and a female lover she'd never identify.

                  Suzie?

     Sam shrugs.

                                  SAM
                  You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was
                  killed.  I don't have to ask you who he
                  thinks did it, do I?
                         (beat)
                  All I'm saying is, read that, you'll
                  have a new perspective on things.

     Gloria sits on the bed, the file in her hand.  She watches as Sam
     pulls on the shirt.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why didn't you tell us about this before

     Sam holds her eyes.

                                  SAM
                  Then -- I still had ethical standards to
                  protect.  They meant a lot to me.  Now,
                  I don't care.  And no amount of money
                  can buy that back.

     Sam is interrupted by the HONKING of a HORN.  He looks outside.

     ANGLE ON LOT - SAM'S POV

     A taxi waits in the glow of the green neon.

     Sam looks down on Gloria, seated on his bed, her skirt short
     enough to REVEAL shapely legs.  For a moment the two hold one
     another's eyes.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  My ride.  If you're not planning on

     A cap and gown lay strewn on the sofa.

     Kelly wears jeans and a bra.  She looks up to see Ray moving
     across the tile.  Her eyes go wide, then move to the gun case.

     EXT. GUEST HOUSE - SAME

     Sandra stands near the jacuzzi, not exactly sure what to do,
     watching as...

     ANGLE ON GUEST HOUSE - SANDRA'S POV

     Ray knocks at the French door.  It swings open.  He steps inside.

     A long moment, then VOI?ES, the SOUND of things being knocked
     about, BREAKING GLASS.

     Sandra starts toward the house then stops at the SOUND of a
     single GUNSHOT.

     A SECOND GUNSHOT follows, then a THIRD.

     The guest house door opens.  Ray stumbles out, his shoulder
     bloody, a .357 in his hand.

     We SEE him from the waist up -- a white T-shirt, his shoulder
     bandaged, his arm in a sling.  There are red scratch marks on his
     face.  His eyes look blankly into the camera.

                                  RAY
                  I fucked up.  I lost control of the

     Perfect crescent of sand.  A man in white shorts reclines in a
     beach chair, beneath a gaily-colored umbrella, sipping a drink.

                  grabbed her, put her on the floor.

     EXT. BEACH RESORT - CLOSER SHOT - DAY

     Sam, in white shorts, looking good, watches a beautiful island
     girl in a thong bikini frolic in the surf.

     She seems to sense Sam watching, turns toward the beach.  Her
     eyes meet Sam's.  She breaks into a beautiful smile.

                                  HUNTER (O.S.)
                  She bit you?

                                  RAY
                  Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned.
                  She calmed down.  I was going to cuff
                  her... She said she thought she was
                  going to be sick.  She asked to use the
                  bathroom.

     EXT. BEACH RESORT - DAY

     Sam and the island girl sit at an outdoor table.  The girl wears
     a short, terry cloth robe, Sam the white shorts and a flowered

                  I told her I was coming with her.  She
                  nodded, like she understood.  We stood

                                  HUNTER (O.S.)
                  You didn't cuff her?

                                  RAY
                  She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought,
                  I would just go with her, stand at the
                  door...
                         (shaking his head)
                  I think I looked away.  A split second.
                  Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts
                  a knee into my groin.
                         (beat)
                  There was this coffee table between us
                  and the wall.  She got one foot on that
                  thing and launched herself at the gun
                  case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could
                  hear it breaking.
                         (beat)
                  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up,
                  just enough.  Before I could get to her,
                  she'd turned on me with this small
                  caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put
                  it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it
                  in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice.
                  I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think.
                  In the chest.

     INT. POLICE ROOM - SAME

     A moment of silence, save for the BUZZING of the MACHINE.  A
     number of plainclothes police, Hunter and Gloria among them,
     watch the tape.

     EXT. BOAT HARBOR (CARIBBEAN ISLAND) - DAY

     Brilliant sun on turquoise water.  A few boats anchored in a
     lagoon.  A quiet place.

     Heading out -- a forty-foot sloop, Sam at the helm.

     INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

     Gloria, Baxter, a tearful Sandra, sit in seats, watch as --

     Ray stands before a panel, A SUIT, A CHIEF in uniform, Hunter.

     Ray wears a suit, his hair neatly trimmed.  His arm is no longer
     in a sling, but one of his hands is still bandaged.

                                  CHIEF
                  Detective Duquette; our investigation
                  concludes that this was a good shooting.
                  But that's irrelevant.  You were not
                  assigned to this case -- whatever you
                  imagined this case to be.  And now two
                  young women are dead.  You are
                  terminated with forfeiture of pension
                  and benefits.

     Ray looks at the floor.

     Hunter coughs.  His hands rest on a file -- we SEE the video
     cassette inside -- labeled "TOLLER/VAN RYAN -- CONFIDENTIAL."

                                  HUNTER
                  Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were
                  found near the area known as Stoner
                  Rocks.  Suzie's blood was found in the
                  Van Ryan Range Rover.  This, in
                  conjunction with evidence obtained by
                  Detectives Duquette and Perez has led
                  this office to the conclusion that Susan
                  Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly
                  Lanier Van Ryan...

     Sandra chokes back a sob.  She gets to her feet, to be led from
     the room by Tom Baxter.

     Gloria Perez watches, a sad look in her eye, then turns to look
     at Ray.  His back is to her -- the broad shoulders, expensive
     suit.  His hands are clasped behind his back.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BLUE BAY CEMETERY - KELLY'S FUNERAL - DAY

     Gloria stands among a considerable number of mourners.  She is
     just back from Sandra and Tom Baxter, who, in turn, are just back
     from the open grave.

     As Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something
     catches her eye.  Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze.

     ANGLE ON CEMETERY - GLORIA'S POV

     On a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people
     stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter.

     When Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman
     has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people
     on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he
     might make them disappear.

     Gloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open
     grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan
     family plot and, in fact, the entire scene.

     ANGLE CN MARKER

     The angel Gabriel, trumpet in hand, carved in relief upon a huge
     obelisk of black marble.  Beneath the angel is a carved scroll
     and upon it the words:

     "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE," and below that:  "WILLIAM
     TECUMSEH VAN RYAN.  MAY HE REST IN PEACE."

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A BEACH - NIGHT

     Sam Lombardo walks along a moonlit lagoon, headed toward a lone
     bungalow.

     The bungalow is simple, picturesque -- whitewashed walls, a
     thatched roof.  A patio opens onto the beach.

     EXT. PATIO - SAME

     As Sam steps in off the sand, he sees something and stops short.

     Wet spots lead toward the bungalow.

     Sam listens.  Everything is quiet.

     INT. BUNGALOW - SAME

     Sam ENTERS in a room lit only by the blue light of a large
     aquarium.  He listens once more, hears it -- RUNNING WATER.

     He moves down a short hallway, observes the light which spills
     from beneath a bedroom door.  He pushes it open, goes inside.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     He CROSSES the room.

     The bathroom door is ajar, the room leaking steam.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Sam steps inside, looks at the shower stall -- an indistinct
     shape moves there in the steam.

     San watches, then jerks open the shower door.  The steam
     clears -- REVEALING a tall, athletic body, and now the face --

     Ray Duquette, grinning at Sam out of the swirling steam.

                                  RAY
                  Buy you a drink?

     San takes a step back.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus.  I wasn't expecting you 'til
                  tomorrow.

     Ray turns off the water, steps out of the stall, wrapping himself
     in a towel.  There's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and
     Ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist.  He
     looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar.

                                  RAY
                  Nice girlfriend you had there.

     Sam just looks at him.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, well, you fixed that.
                         (beat)
                  What the hell happened, anyway?

                                  RAY
                  The bitch shot me, is what happened.

     Sam shakes his head, walks back into the bedroom.  Ray follows.

                                  RAY (CCNT'D)
                  Hey, what did you want me to do, die?

                                  SAM
                  Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't
                  teach you to disarm people, shoot them
                  in the leg or something?  You weren't
                  supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.

     Now Ray just looks at Sam, his eyes narrowing.

                                  RAY
                  Did you become squeamish about these
                  things before or after you bludgeoned
                  little Suzie Toller to death with a wine
                  bottle?
                         (off Sam's silence)
                  Jesus, man.
                  It couldn't have worked out better.
                  They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie.
                  I can't talk 'em out of it.
                         (beat)
                  We should be celebrating.  This thing
                  worked out just like you said, only
                  better.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly was supposed to be framed, not
                  killed.
                         (beat)
                  What I'm telling you is, I don't like
                  surprises.

     Ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a
     bucket of ice.  He opens the bottle, fills two glasses.  He hands
     one of the glasses to Sam.

                                  RAY
                  Every cloud has a silver lining,
                  partner.  Here's to no loose ends.

     He raises his glass in a toast.

     Sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well.  Ray smiles.  Sam
     doesn't.

                                  SAM
                  Here's to no more surprises.

     Ray shrugs.  The two men's eyes meet.  They touch glasses and
     drink.

     EXT. SMALL BOAT HARBOR (ISLAND) - DAY

     Sam and Ray work on the deck of Sam's sloop, stowing gear,
     loading supplies.

     The boat's mast shines in the sunlight before a brilliant sky.
     Palms sway.  The men work in silence.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     Gloria drives up in the white Taurus.  She parks before the
     ramshackle old building and the gator pen.

     Walter is in the pen.  Ruby stands just outside of it.  She looks
     toward the road as Gloria gets out, then back to the pen.

     Gloria comes down the bank to stand beside Ruby.  She's just in
     time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its
     front legs, jaws sprung wide.  The women watch as Walter sticks
     his arm into the gator's mouth.

                                  RUBY
                  Gator can't see what's in front of it
                  for shit.  They see out the sides.
                         (beat)
                  That one don't even know Walter's arm's
                  in his mouth.

                                  GLORIA
                  What if something distracts it and it
                  snaps anyway?

                                  RUBY
                  Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of
                  his goodbye.
                         (loud enough for Walter
                          to hear)
                  He don't use it for no good deeds
                  anyway.

     Walter looks at the ladies, picks up the stick and sweeps it
     between the gaping jaws, which snap in its wake.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  You come all the way out here to watch
                  Walter?

                                  GLORIA
                  I was wondering if I could ask you a few
                  questions.

                                  RUBY
                  About Suzie?

                                  GLORIA
                  Actually, I was wondering if I might ask
                  you about Ray Duquette.

                                  RUBY
                         (a long beat)
                  He used to come around here.  He had a
                  thing going with one of the girls over
                  at the Glades.

     Ruby nods toward the motel, a bitter smile on her face.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  Got sort of hung up on her, from what
                  hear.

                                  GLORIA
                  She still work there?

                                  RUBY
                  No.  Not after that night.
                         (a long beat)
                  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he
                  caught her with some john...
                  All I know is, the next morning the girl
                  was gone and there was a dead boy...
                  Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live
                  down the road there in a wrecked car.
                  Him and Suzie were at the Glades that
                  night.
                         (beat)
                  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie
                  busted and sent her away.  That's what
                  there is to say about Ray Duquette.

                                  GLORIA
                  Was there ever any kind of
                  investigation...

     Ruby cuts her off with a short laugh.

                                  RUBY
                  Duquette always claimed the kid was
                  dusted, came after him with a knife.
                  But it was Jack's Fish Camp... This
                  could be the moon for all most people
                  care.
                         (a long beat)
                  Wasn't supposed to be like that though.
                  This place was supposed to be something
                  once.  There were going to be roads and
                  houses.  There was going to be a town.
                  They were going to call it Salt Creek.

     EXT. OCEAN - DAY

     From the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the
     distance.  The bow of the sloop comes INTO FRAME.

     On board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm.  Ray lounges
     on the deck.  The boat sails easily before the wind.

                                  SAM
                  Ray... you see that winch by your head?
                  Take a couple of turns on it for me,
                  she's luffing.

     Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch.

                                  RAY
                  You mean this thing?

                                  SAM
                  Yes, we call it a winch.
                         (pointing at pieces of
                          the rigging)
                  And these are shrouds, and these are
                  stays.

                                  RAY
                  I thought this was supposed to be a
                  vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big
                  power boat?

                                  SAM
                  Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of
                  you yet.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, or get me drowned.

     Ray kneels.  He begins to tighten the winch.

     Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back
     to unhook the short line which holds the boom.

     The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc,
     directly at Ray.

     Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm.

     The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines,
     where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords.

     Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the
     deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board.

     The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a
     small ground swell.

     The two men face each other.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus, man... You okay?

                                  RAY
                  That how you planned it?  You take cut
                  Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then
                  dump me in the ocean...

                                  SAM
                  Come off it, man... It was an accident.

     Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and
     starts with it toward Sam.

     Sam looks around.  He jerks open a storage compartment.  A
     diver's weight belt tumbles out.  Sam grabs it, swings it over
     his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum,
     preparing to throw.

     Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle.  The boom
     sweeps the deck.

     Sam throws the belt.

     Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself,
     a mean grin spreading across his face.

     There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else.

     Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall,
     well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.

     Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit.  Ray jumps in.  But that's
     as far as he gets.

     WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.  He screams, goes down,
     the handle skittering across the deck.

     Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he
     sees something else.  He draws in his hand as if bitten.

                                  RAY
                  You... You're...

     He scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at
     his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed.
     But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  You're dead... for godsake...

     The boat heels over.  The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the
     edge of the cockpit.  He grimaces in pain as...

     Suzie Toller steps up from belowdecks.  She's wearing a bikini
     and showing a nice tan.  She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a
     fresh spear at the ready.

                                  SUZIE
                  Rumors of my demise have been greatly
                  exaggerated.
                         (to Sam)
                  Nice move.  Good thing I was here to
                  save your incompetent ass.

     Sam secures the boom.  Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with
     some combination of pain, rage and fear.

                                  RAY
                  You... I should've killed you myself.
                  should never have left it up to him...

                                  SUZIE
                  Shoulda, coulda, woulda...
                         (to Sam)
                  Get him in the water.

     San starts for Ray.

                                  RAY
                  Sam, for Christ's sake...

     Sam's feet slide in the bloody smear.  He stops.

     Ray clings to a safety line.

                                  SAM
                  I can't.

     WHOOSH -- A second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder.  He loses his
     grip.  The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water.

     Suzie puts down her spear gun.  She goes to a storage locker,
     takes out a bait bucket.  She steps up on the deck.

     Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around
     him.  He calls out...

                                  RAY
                  Sam, for godsake.

                                  SUZIE
                  Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the
                  numbered bank account besides yours and
                  Sam's?

     She raises the bucket, heaves bloody chum into the water.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I like these joint survivorship
                  accounts.  Something unfortunate happens
                  to one of the signatories, the others
                  don't have to worry.  Are you worrying,
                  Ray?

     She heaves more chum -- a big red slurp across Ray's face.

     Ray gasps, goes under, thrashing around in the red slick.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em.

     INSERT - SHARKS

     from underwater, in a frenzy, rip a human body into a bloody
     cloud.

     EXT. SAILBOAT - LATER

     Suzie cones up from below with a champagne bottle and glasses,
     already filled.

                                  SUZIE
                  Feeling better?

     Sam gazes out to sea.

                                  SAM
                  That was about as grim as it gets.

                                  SUZIE
                  The guy was history when he killed
                  Kelly.  You knew that.

                                  SAM
                  But then you knew what he was like all
                  along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a
                  thing you had counted on...

                                  SUZIE
                  But then it is better this way, don't
                  you think?  No loose ends.

     Sam just looks at her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  What?

                                  SAM
                  That was the same thing Ray said.

     Suzie smiles -- showing the big gap where her two front teeth
     used to be.

                                  SUZIE
                  Poor Ray.
                         (a beat)
                  Come on Sam, we did it.  We put the
                  screws to the Van Ryans.  We won.

     She hands a glass to Sam, takes the other.  He puts it to his
     lips, suddenly hesitates, thinks, sniffs the glass.

     A moment.  Suzie shakes her head.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Talk about paranoid.  Now are you gonna
                  teach me to sail this big old boat or
                  not?

     Sam downs his drink.

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  Grab that winch there.

     Suzie gives him a pouty look.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  What's wrong?

                                  SUZIE
                  Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.

     Sam sighs.

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  Come here and take the helm.
                  I'll get the winch.

     Suzie gives him her best, gap-toothed smile, then comes forward
     to take the gleaming chrome wheel, as Sam scrambles up on deck,
     kneeling where Ray had kneeled before him to set the jib.

     Suzie watches -- a long beat, then, slowly reaches behind her,
     unhooking the line which holds the boom...

     ANGLE ON BOOM

     sweeping the deck -- coming right at us, blotting out the sky.

     EXT. SMILING JACK'S - SUZIE'S ROOM - DAY

     Gloria sits on Suzie's bed, books spread out around her.  Ruby
     stands beside her.

                                  RUBY
                  You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt
                  Creek land deal?  Girl read every book
                  she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.

     Ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a
     photograph on the bed.  It is one we have seen before.

     ANGLE ON PHOTO

     A stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit.  White hair, a
     white handlebar mustache.  A derby on his knee, a walking stick
     at his side.  He stares out at the world from a high-backed
     wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers.

     Across the bottom of the picture is the name -- "WILLIAM TECUMSEH
     VAN RYAN."  And beside that, in another hand -- "Dear old Dad."

                                  RUBY
                  Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy
                  the people who invested here.  He got to
                  be old, he and his rich cronies would
                  come down here, hunt and whore, act like
                  assholes.  One trip he showed up with
                  this young girl he'd picked up
                  somewhere, gotten her pregnant then
                  dumped her in the swamp.
                         (indicating the photo)
                  That came with her.

                                  GLORIA
                  And the child...

                                  RUBY
                  She had it, before she drank herself to
                  death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...

                                  GLORIA
                  Suzie.
                         (beat)
                  Then you're not her grandmother...

                                  RUBY
                  Raised her like she was, but no,
                  Walter's my only child.
                         (beat)
                  He was a good boy, till the army took
                  him.

     Gloria looks once more at the old photograph.

                                  GLORIA
                  So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half-
                  sisters.

                                  RUBY
                  And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's
                  niece.

     Gloria stands, a little weary.  Ruby walks her from the room.

                                  GLORIA
                  Thank you for talking to me, Ruby.  I am
                  sorry about Suzie, she...

     They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short,
     noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white
     TV has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television.

                                  RUBY
                  You okay?

                                  GLORIA
                  I'm fine.  Nice TV.

     The old lady nods, walks her outside.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     The dusty road, the little dock, the gator pen.

                                  RUBY
                  There's an old saying from the
                  Everglades -- virtue may be missed but
                  sin can't hide.
                         (a long beat)
                  Folks pay in the end.

     Gloria nods.  She is distracted by a movement in the gator pen.

     CLOSE ON PEN

     For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the
     surface of the pond which lies inside the pen, then, slowly, the
     GATOR'S EYES -- cold, reptilian, unblinking, rising up to gaze
     across the oily waters.

                                                 HARD CUT TO:

     BLACK.  CREDITS...

     for about ten seconds, enough to fool the audience, then...

     INTERCUT - LIKE OUTTAKES...

     ... PIECES OF SCENES WE COULDN'T SEE, or SCENES WE DIDN'T SEE AT
     ALL, in reverse chronological order.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kelly is frantically trying to unlock the gun case as Ray comes
     through the French doors.  She can't get it done.  He's there in
     an instant.

     She screams, backs away, then watches as Ray stops, wraps a hanky
     around his hand and breaks the glass.

     He takes out a small caliber handgun, checks the clip, aims the
     gun at his own shoulder and fires.

     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then

     EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY

     A Jeep and a truck parked in the mud.  Sam and Ray meet under
     heavy, moss-draped cypress.  Sam hands Ray a plastic bag -- the
     teeth.

                                  SAM
                  You know the place I'm talking about --
                  the big rocks?

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     SAM & SUZIE

     behind the big rocks.  He's got vise-grip pliers jammed in her
     mouth.  Suzie moans, for real.  He loosens his grip.

                                  SUZIE
                  You've got the pressure too tight.
                  You'll crush the fucking evidence.

     Sam takes a breath, prepares to try again.  Suzie pops a couple
     of pills with gulps of wine.  Sam goes to it once more.

     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - DAY

     Kelly and Sam on the floor, naked.  He's on her from the rear.
     It's getting wild.  He suddenly stops, rolls to the floor.

                                  SAM
                  We gotta stop.  I'm gonna come.

     Kelly laughs, straddles him.

                                  KELLY
                  That never seemed to worry you at the
                  Glades.

                                  SAM
                  That's not your line.

                                  KELLY
                  Say you love me.

                                  SAM
                         (a beat)
                  I love you.  Now give me the line.

                                  KELLY
                         (a whiny voice)
                  No little girl can ever make me come.

     EXT. THE GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     Suzie's VW is parked across the street, in the shadows of tall
     trees.  She and Sam sit inside, watching as...

     Ray Duquette EXITS a bungalow, a sport coat over his arm.  He
     heads for Jim's Recovery Room.  In another moment, a young hooker
     in a leather miniskirt walks out of the same bungalow.

                                  SUZIE
                  Seems to like some of the same places
                  you do.  Funny you never met.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about
                  this, I could get busted on the spot.

                                  SUZIE
                  Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like
                  it.  Especially the part about offing
                  me.
                         (beat)
                  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a
                  new friend.

     INT. JIM'S RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

     Ray is at the bar.  Sam sits down next to him.  A moment of
     silence, the twang of a country JUKE BOX -- then...

                                  SAM
                  Buy you a drink?

     Suzie Toller framed in the doorway.  She walks in.

                  You like bein' a caddy for rich kids'
                  problems?

     Sam just looks at her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I've seen you out there in your old air
                  boat, thinking about what might have
                  been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you
                  out of it.
                         (beat)
                  What if I told you I had a way we could
                  get a big piece of it back?

                                  SAM
                  We?

                                  SUZIE
                  Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo
                  charm, not that you'd have to do
                  anything you haven't done already.

     She takes an envelope from her notebook, tosses it in front of
     Sam.  Pictures slide onto his desk -- Sam and Kelly -- in various
     poses of coked-out debauchery at the Glades Motel.

                                  SAM

                  Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie
                  through knotholes for years.  I saw
                  these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.
                         (beat)
                  I can't decide which came out better,
                  that little straw Kelly's got up her
                  nose, or that vibrator you've got up her
                  ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

                         (a long beat)
                  I think there's some things you do, you
                  don't want to see yourself doing them.

     Sam lounges in a booth.  He looks hot, bored.  He stirs a drink.
     Kelly walks in out of the light.  She is looking a little strung
     out, a big straw bag slung over one shoulder, but oh, so sexy in
     skimpy cutoffs and cowboy boots -- long legs flashing as she
     nears Sam's booth.  Sam looks up, as...

                  I'm running away.

                         (reaching into her bag)
                  I have toys.

     She takes out a snail bag of white powder, taps out a line on the
     table top.

     Sam looks at it.  He looks at Kelly.  He's had a few drinks.

                                  SAM

                  Old lady had her tested once.  They said

                  That girl could do just about anything,

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     A place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround
     an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana
     palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.

     Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the
     waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of
     the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.

     For a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many
     VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.

     The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger
     than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder.

     INT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY

     A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage.
     The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a
     veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to
     have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight
     shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...

     SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish,
     drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids,
     in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.

     His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon
     the girls.

     KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.

     NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's
     walk, then turns to the girl at her side...

     KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.

                                  NICOLE
                  When we graduate the only thing I'm
                  going to miss is...
                         (with a nod to the stage)
                  Know what I mean?

     Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam.  Nicole has to nudge her.

                                  NICOLE (CONT'D)
                  Kelly?

                                  KELLY
                         (still staring)
                  Oh yeah.

     Sam is at the podium.  He looks out across the audience.  There
     are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter.  Sam smiles,
     silencing them with a wave of his hand.

                                  SAM
                  We've come to the halfway point in my
                  senior seminars...

     Cheers, applause.  Sam waits for the kids to settle.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                  No!

     Boos as we FIND...

     JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.  He sits with a clique
     of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue
     Bay School.  Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...

     SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just
     enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a
     loner.  She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.

                                  SAM
                  Thank you, Jimmy.

                                  JIMMY
                  Hey, man, at least in study hail I could
                  meditate.

                                  KIRK (O.S.)
                  He means masturbate...

     This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND...

     KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.

                                  SAM
                  Something Kirk with which I'm sure you
                  have hands-on experience.

     Loud laughter.  Sam quiets them again, then turns to the
     blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X.
     The kids start to cheer.

     Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S.

     The cheering fades into silence.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  We've all heard the words, date rape,
                  sexual harassment.  We've talked about
                  some of these things in this room.
                         (beat)
                  Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay
                  Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray
                  Duquette and Gloria Perez.
                         (beat)
                  They're here to give you what we hope
                  will be a fresh perspective on these
                  subjects, and to answer any questions
                  you night have.

     Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors...

     RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light
     heavyweight, walks out onto the stage.  He's dressed in a dark
     suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses.

     GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.  She's a good six inches shorter
     than Ray, with a sweet face.  Attractive but no stunner.

     About five kids applaud.  Ray takes the podium.

                                  RAY
                  Thank you for having us.  We'll each
                  talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then
                  open it up to your questions...

     IN THE AUDIENCE

     Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet.  As she passes behind
     Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath.

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm not going to listen to this
                  jack-off.

     She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door..

     Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...

                                  RAY
                  Let's begin with a question.  What is a
                  sex crime?

     A moment.

                                  JIMMY
                  Not getting any.

     This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles
     from Sam and Gloria.  And none at all from Ray Duquette.

     EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

     The kids change classes.  Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass.
     The kids swarm past.  A pair of girls flash by.

                                  CAROLE
                  Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo.

                                  SAM

                  Hey, Carole, you too.  And be good.

                                  CAROLE
                         (beneath a pouty look)
                  I hate to be good.

     The three adults ENTER an old wooden building.

     INT. BUILDING - DAY

                                  SAM
                  This is one of the original buildings.
                  We have the offices here now.

     The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs.
     Gloria stops before one of the photos.

     ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH

     An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to
     another age.

     A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat
     under sail.  His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an
     unseen horizon.  There is something in this boy's pose, in the
     line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has
     fixed upon is the future itself.

                                  GLORIA
                  Anybody in particular?

     When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side.  He
     stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria.

                                  SAM
                  Sam Lombardo.  The first.  Class of
                  'Forty-Two
                         (beat)
                  My father.

     Gloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and
     back again.

                                  VOICE (0.S.)
                  Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos
                  around here.

     Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a
     baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene.

                                  SAM
                  Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and
                  Duquette.
                         (to the cops)
                  Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.

     Art and the detectives shake hands.

                                  ART
                  So, did you set 'em all straight on the
                  ugly facts of life?

                                  SAM
                  I have the feeling, they got it down
                  already.  They're a step ahead of us,
                  Artie.

     Gloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks
     at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at
     which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.

                                  RAY
                  I've got that two o'clock in town.

                                  GLORIA
                         (nodding)
                  Back to the land of grownups.

     The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art.

                                  SAM
                         (to Gloria)
                  If old pictures interest you, come back
                  some time, there's quite a collection
                  down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a
                  proper tour.

                                  GLORIA
                         (smiling)
                  I'd like that.

     Ray opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it.

     Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway.
     Sam remains near the doors, watching as...

     ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL

     Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range
     Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus,
     which they get into and drive away.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER

     Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden
     pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the
     bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks.

     ANGLE ON DOCKS

     As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one
     student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets
     about tying off the boat.

     Sam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder.

                                  SAM
                         (loud enough to be heard
                          by his class)
                  Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil
                  those dock lines and I'll see you all on
                  Monday.

     He watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon
     the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in
     work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky.

     EXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER

     hosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as...
     A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake.

                                  JIMMY
                  All right.  I could party on that.

     Sam just laughs at him.

                                  SAM
                  That's about all it's good for.
                         (beat)
                  That's the one to have.

     He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the
     bay, under sail.

                                  SAM
                  The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that
                  one summer.
                         (beat)
                  Long time ago.

     He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.

                                  JIMMY
                  You know, I want to thank you for
                  getting me into this class...  No way was
                  my old man going to spring for the
                  fees...

                                  SAM
                  Hey, you're working for it.
                         (beneath a laugh)
                  Least you're supposed to be.

     He tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but
     catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                  Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys?

     Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the
     dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse
     knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at
     the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam
     with a coy smile.

                                  KELLY
                  So who's washing your car this weekend,
                  Mr. Lombardo?
                         (off Sam's blank look)
                  The senior car wash, remember?
                         (beat)
                  Tamara's making a schedule.  She said
                  you bought a coupon but you're not on
                  anybody's list.

     Sam smiles, remembering.

                                  SAM
                  Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a
                  Washing ticket, support the effort.
                  That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste
                  of time, don't you think?

     Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the
     dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then.

                                  KELLY
                  Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I
                  do it?  We're working as a team.

     Sam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.

                                  SAM
                  Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out
                  to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys
                  can wash the mud off.

                                  KELLY
                  Deal.
                         (beat)
                  You know, I just looked out front.  My
                  ride wasn't there.  You suppose you
                  could give me one?

     Sam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  You wouldn't want me to walk, would you?
                  I mean like, something bad might happen.

     Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who
     seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.

                                  SAM
                  What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?

                                  JIMMY
                         (still looking at Kelly)
                  What?

                                  SAM
                  A ride.  You want one?

                                 JIMMY
                  Yeah.  But I got my bike.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning
     that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which
     is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His
     arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy.

     As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit
     VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.

     A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall
     black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...

     Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff
     jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.

     Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.

                                  SAM
                  We got room for one more, Suzie.  You
                  need a ride?

     Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them.

                                  KELLY
                  Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes?
                  Whores-4-Less?

     Suzie's eyes go cold.  She signals the groundsman, who turns the
     key.  The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.  Suzie flashes a smile, then
     sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  That's cute.

     Suzie gives her the finger.  Sam makes eye contact with Suzie,
     offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                         (to Suzie)
                  I hope you swallow it.

     Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away.

     EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid
     lush, tropical settings.

     Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "VAN RYAN"
     woven into their wrought-iron design.  Beyond the gates a long
     drive leads toward a huge stone house.  Kelly jumps out, punches
     in a code.  The gates swing open.

                                  KELLY
                  Don't forget the car wash.

                                  SAM
                  I won't.

     SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42
     in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.  When
     she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive.

     Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.  When she sees her
     mother coming toward her, her face hardens.

                                  SANDRA
                  Is that Sam Lombardo?

                                  KELLY
                         (sarcastic)
                  Hi, Mon.

                                  SANDRA
                  Sam!  Hi!

     Sam has already hung a U.

     Sandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep.

     Jimmy is checking her out.  All eyes.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                         (to Sam; as if Jimmy
                          wasn't even there)
                  What?  You're going to drive off without
                  even saying hi?

                                  SAM
                  Hi, Sandy.

                                  SANDRA
                  Why don't you come in, have a drink?

                                  SAM
                  Can't.  Got a passenger.

     Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy.

                                  SANDRA
                  He can wait.

     Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front
     of the house, watching.

                                  SAM
                  I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.

                                  SANDRA
                  I'll bet.
                         (then, softening)
                  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this
                  weekend.  We'll take the boat out...

                                  SAM
                         (cutting her off)
                  Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.

                                  SANDRA
                  What?  Running over alligators with that
                  silly swamp jalopy when you could be
                  sailing a real boat...

                                  SAM
                  Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you
                  a look into the muck we all crawled out
                  of.  You ought to try it some time.

     Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.

     CLOSE ON KELLY

     still at the door, a cold smile on her face.

                                                 FADE TO:

     EXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

     Neat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in
     tropical heat.

     A BMW Z-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac.  Nicole
     is driving.  Kelly sits beside her.

                                  NICOLE
                  This is it?

     Kelly looks at a pad of paper, nods.

                                  KELLY
                  Four-thirty-seven.

     They pass a couple of teenagers playing basketball in a driveway,
     a guy mowing his yard.

                                  NICOLE
                  Nice.

                                  KELLY
                  What do you want, he's a teacher for
                  Christ's sake.
                         (beat)
                  It's here.  Pull over.

     Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses.  Sam's muddy
     Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive.  Behind that is a red
     Mercedes convertible.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on
     the bed.  Barbara is dressed for tennis.  Sam wears a baggy pair
     of khaki shorts.  Barbara struggles to escape.  Sam grabs a leg,
     kisses the back of her knee.

     He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her
     thighs.

                                  BARBARA
                         (getting just a little
                          breathless)
                  Sam, come on... I'm gonna be late for my
                  game...

     Sam keeps at it.  She's starting to weaken.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  Not that I'm going to be much good after
                  last night...

                                  SAM
                  Eat a power bar.

     Barbara starts to giggle.  He's just about got her when...

     The DOORBELL RINGS.  Sam lets go.  Barbara sighs.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam goes to the front door, opens it, to find...

     Kelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags.  The girls
     are dressed in Blue Bay High T-shirts, cropped to REVEAL flat
     tummies, shorts and running shoes.

                                  GIRLS
                  Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam looks over the girls -- a small, exasperated smile.

                                  KELLY
                  Look, he forgot.  I knew it.

                                  SAM
                  No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's
                  nice and dirty for you.
                         (beat)
                  But you might want to wait a minute.
                  The Mercedes is leaving.

                                  NICOLE
                  You mean that isn't yours too?

     The girls giggle.  Sam smiles.

                                  KELLY
                  Where's the hose?  We can set up.

                                  SAM
                  In back of the garage.

     As they walk away, he is joined by Barbara.  She watches the
     girls with an appraising eye.

                                  BARBARA
                  Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?

                                  SAM
                  Kelly.

                                  BARBARA
                  She's going to wash your Jeep?

                                  SAM
                  Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told
                  'em they could hose down the Jeep.
                         (off Barbara's look)
                  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.

     Barbara laughs at him.

                                  BARBARA
                  Sam the philanthropist.
                         (a beat)
                  Tomorrow, right?

     Sam nods.  Another kiss.

     EXT. SAM'S DRIVEWAY - SAME

     As Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind
     the garage.  She looks at Sam, standing in his doorway, watching
     the girls.  When he sees Barbara looking at him, he shrugs, then
     waves.

     EXT. FRONT DOOR - SAM'S HOUSE - LATER

     Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet
     T-shirt derby, ring the bell.

     Sam answers.  He looks them over.  A couple of houses down he can
     see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching
     the girls, then turning to walk back to his house.

                                  SAM
                  So, where you off to now?

                                  KELLY
                  Aren't  you forgetting something?
                          (off Sam's look)
                  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.

                                  SAM
                  Jeez, that thing... Can't you...

                                  KELLY
                         (smiling)
                  Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

     Nicole laughs.

                                  SAM
                  All right.  I'll have to look for it.

                                  KELLY
                         (as he starts to go)
                  Mr. Lombardo.
                         (as he stops)
                  We're running kind of late.  How about
                  if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You
                  could give me a ride when you find the
                  ticket.

     Sam looks at her, as does Nicole.

                                  SAM
                  Give me a minute.

     He hurries from the room.  Kelly turns to Nicole, giving her the
     eye, pointing toward the drive.

                                  NICOLE
                         (mouthing the words)
                  Are you sure?

     Kelly nods, a mischievous smile on her face.

     INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam is rummaging through drawers.  He stops when he hears the
     SOUND of a CAR.  He goes to the window in time to see Nicole's
     BMW headed down his street.

     INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam ENTERS the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where
     the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the
     linoleum.

     Sam looks at the water.  He looks at Kelly.  She moves a step
     closer, allowing the door to SWING shut behind her.

     EXT. SAM'S NEIGHBORHOOD

     A long, slow, Antonioni PAN -- time passes -- the cul-de-sac --
     the sparkling lawns -- the kids with the basketball -- a jogger
     passing by...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. SAM'S PORCH - LATER

     The front door.  The door opens.  Kelly comes out, fast, slamming
     the door behind her.  She walks down the drive.

     There are tears on her face.  As she hits the street, she begins
     to run.

     The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer.
     He watches as the girl runs by.

     The teenagers are still playing hoops.  They stop as Kelly jogs
     past, sobbing.  They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac
     and DISAPPEARS around a corner.

     EXT. THE EVERGLADES - DAY

     Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat,
     rips through the Florida swamp land.

     He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall
     grass which whips at the hull of his boat.  Bits and pieces of
     debris fly through the air.  Sam smiles, swinging the boat
     through a series of wide, sliding turns.

     Suddenly he spots something.  He throttles down gliding into a
     shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found
     out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT

                                  SAM
                  Sly old fucker.  How you got so big,
                  wasn't it?

     Sam sits for a moment in the silence.  He pulls a pair of
     binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them.

     ANGLE ON HORIZON

     All we SEE is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings
     shimmering in the last long light of afternoon.

     Sam watches for some time.  At last he lowers the binoculars,
     revs up his engine and leaves.

     ANGLE ON SAM'S BOAT

     as it moves away, as SEEN from water level where...

     The old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold
     primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky
     waters of the swamp.

     EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Sam's Wrangler pulls in next to Barbara's Mercedes.  The Jeep is
     muddy once more.  So is Sam.  He gets out.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - SAME

     Sam ENTERS.  The house is dark.

                                   SAM
                  Barbara?

     Nothing.  Me CROSSES the living room and starts down the hallway,
     where a faint light issues from beneath the bedroom door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam opens the door.  He hears the SOUND of RUNNING WATER.  He
     walks across the room and into the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam.  Behind the glass
     door we SEE an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water.
     Sam opens the shower door.  The steam clears to REVEAL Barbara's
     gorgeous athletic body.

                                  BARBARA
                  It's hot in here, just the way you like
                  it.

     She grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow.  They
     kiss.  She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants.  His clothes
     fall away.  Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard.  She
     holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping
     her legs around his hips as...

     The water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - NIGHT

     Kelly Van Ryan sits on the dock, looking back toward the huge
     stone house, where...

     A YELLOW LIGHT burns in one of the upstairs windows.

     Kelly has a shotgun laid across her knees.  Slowly, she raises
     the gun, pointing at the yellow window.

     She holds it there for some time, then, softly, to herself...

                                  KELLY
                  Bang...

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - VAN RYAN ESTATE - NEXT DAY

     Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs
     of pleasure... Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big,
     buffed-out Cuban.  They're making love on the bed.  She throws
     her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is
     near, as...

     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table.  They try to ignore
     it.  No dice.  Sandra groans, finally pulling away.

                                  SANDRA
                  Goddamnit!
                         (she answers)
                  Hello.

                                  COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
                  Hello, this is the attendance office at
                  Blue Bay School.  Your son or daughter
                  is absent today, Monday...

                                  SANDRA
                  Jesus H. Christ!

     She hangs up hard.  Sits on the edge of the bed.

                                  FRANKIE
                  What?

     Sandra waves him off.  She pulls on a T-shirt, then grabs up the
     phone once more, punching in a number.

     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Desk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a
     photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall.  There's a
     Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with "Sam Lombardo -- Blue
     Bay Educator of the Year."

     Sam is working on the computer.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers.

                                  SAM
                  Counseling.

     XNTERCUT - SANDRA/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION

     Sandra seated on the bed, one long leg tucked beneath her.

                                  SANDRA
                  Sam, Sandy Van Ryan.

     Frankie's eyes go cold when he hears the word "Sam."

     In his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer,
     stiffening noticeably.

                                  SAM
                  Sandy... What's up?

                                  SANDRA
                  Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you
                  talked to her?

                                  SAM
                  No.

                                  SANDRA
                  Shit. Here we go again.

                                  SAM
                  Didn't you see her this morning?

                                  SANDRA
                  To tell you the truth, I haven't seen
                  her since Friday.

     BOOM -- A SHOTGUN BLASTS outside Sandra's window.  She jumps.
     BOOM, BOOM -- more BLASTS.  She jumps up to look outside.

     SANDRA'S POV - KELLY

     stands at the edge of the bay, launching skeet then blasting them
     high above the water.

     BACK TO SCENE

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Never mind.  I found her.
                         (a long beat)
                  Listen, Sam.  It was good seeing you the
                  other day.
                         (beat)
                  I haven't found anyone else can handle
                  the Jonathan like you can.

     She glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough.  He gives her a
     long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room.

     Sam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank,
     unblinking eyes.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara
                  Baxter.  So what?

                                  SAM
                  So maybe I'm a one-woman man.

     Sandra laughs.

                                  SANDRA
                  Right.
                         (beat)
                  You really think you're gonna get one of
                  these Blue Bay women to marry you?

     Sandra pauses to laugh once more.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand
                  around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.

                                  SAM
                  Goodbye, Sandra.

     Sam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the
     barest hint of a smile plays upon his face.

     Sandra slams down her phone.  She looks to the bay, to the sleek
     racing sloop floating beyond the private dock.

                                  SANDRA
                  The nerve of some people.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY

     The SHOTGUN BLASTS away.  Kelly pauses to reload.  She catches
     sight of...

     Sandra, approaching from the main house.

                                  SANDRA
                  You seem to find guns therapeutic.
                  Maybe I oughta try it.

     Kelly lets the gun's barrel drift over Sandra, then turns to walk
     away.  She moves toward the guest house.  A used-brick cottage
     tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan
     tree.  Sandra follows.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Let me guess, some boy didn't call and
                  screwed up the weekend.  So you're
                  taking the day off.

     Kelly looks toward the main house, in time to see...

     Frankie walk from the bedroom and dive into the pool.

                                  KELLY
                  Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?

                                  SANDRA
                  Whichever one I want.

     Kelly turns away, starts for the guest house once more.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

     PAN to REVEAL room -- the gun case, the animal trophies, the
     photos -- One of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker
     chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee.  Others of Kelly
     and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their
     rifles above slain wildebeests and bison.

     Sandra and Kelly ENTER.  Kelly puts down the shotgun, turns,
     tears in her eyes.

                                  SANDRA
                  Okay, what's the matter?

                                  KELLY
                  You notice my new jumper?

     Kelly does a three-sixty, like a model on a runway.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  My friends buy me clothes, so I don't
                  look like trash.

                                  SANDRA
                  I would hardly say you look like trash.

                                  KELLY
                  No thanks to you.

     She sits on the bed.  Sandra moves to stand over her, angry now.

                                  SANDRA
                  Come off of it.
                         (a beat)
                  You run with all these little trust fund
                  brats... They think money grows on
                  trees.  It doesn't.  Believe me.  And a
                  lot of your little friends are gonna
                  learn that one the hard way.
                         (beat)
                  I'm trying to spare you that.

     Kelly goes to one shoulder on the bed, sobbing now.  Her mother
     continues to stand over her, suddenly more perplexed than angry.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Kelly.  What is it?

                                  KELLY
                  I miss Dad.

                                  SANDRA
                  Jesus.
                         (a long beat)
                  Well, I do too, sometimes...

                                  KELLY
                  No you don't.

                                  SANDRA
                  He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.
                  He could have gone out and gotten a job.
                  Christ, he could've found another rich
                  woman... He never had a problem tucking
                  my friends when we were married.

     She pauses as Kelly cries all the harder.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  I don't know why he did it.  I really
                  don't...

     Her voice trails away, as meanwhile Kelly has drawn herself up
     into a fetal position on the bed.  The sobbing has stopped but
     her shoulders continue to shake.  Sandra sits on the edge of the
     bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Can I get you anything?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

     Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss.  At last she stands.
     She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the
     words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.

                                  SANDRA
                  What, honey?  I can't hear you.

     There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself.  She stares at
     the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she
     enunciates each word.

                                  KELLY
                  I said.  I was raped.

     Sandra looks as if she has been struck.

                                  SANDRA
                  What?

                                  KELLY
                  I was raped.
                         (a long beat)
                  By Sam Lombardo.

     Sandra moves over to the bed, sits once more.

                                  SANDRA
                  He... Sam Lombardo?

                                  KELLY
                  Yes.  God, Mom...

     Kelly begins to cry.  Sandra pulls her upright, cradling her in
     her arms, eyes on fire.

     EXT. BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - DAY

     An old Spanish-style building sits before a neat square of grass.

                                  SANDRA (V.O.)
                  My daughter does not get raped in Blue
                  Bay!

     INT. STATION HOUSE - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Sandra slams a fist on the conference table.

     Kelly is seated between her mother and her mother's attorney, TOM
     BAXTER.  Baxter sports an Italian suit and a lethal Alexander
     Haig look.

     Seated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and BRYCE HUNTER,
     the local D.A.

     Silence follows Sandra's outburst.  Baxter reaches to squeeze
     Sandra's shoulder.  Kelly puts her face in her hands.

                                  RAY
                         (in a quiet voice)
                  You're saying that Kelly was raped by
                  Sam Lombardo.

                                  SANDRA
                  That's right.

     Ray and Gloria exchange looks.  Gloria in particular looks
     slightly stunned.

                                  GLORIA
                  The guidance counselor at Blue Bay?

                                  SANDRA
                         (sarcastically)
                  The guidance counselor at Blue Bay.

                                  GLORIA
                  We understand your feelings, Ms. Van
                  Ryan.  But please, we'd like some time
                  with Kelly.  We'd like to take her
                  statement alone.

     Baxter nods, yes.  Sandra looks at Kelly.

                                  SANDRA
                  Are you okay for this?

     Kelly nods.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  The man must be insane to think he can
                  do this to me...

     Tom Baxter takes her by the arm as Ray CROSSES the room to open
     the door.  Bryce Hunter walks out with then.

     Gloria takes a seat closer to Kelly.  When she speaks, she is
     very calm and quiet.

                                  GLORIA
                  How are you, Kelly? Would you like to
                  take a break for a minute?

                                  KELLY
                         (shaking her head)
                  I just want to get it over with.  My
                  mom's making me do this. I just want to
                  forget it.

                                  GLORIA
                  I know you do.

     She waits as Ray sets up a camera on a tripod.

                                  GLORIA (CCNT'D)
                  We'd like to videotape the statement if
                  that's all right with you.

     Kelly shrugs.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  I know this is not pleasant, Kelly.  But
                  these are serious charges and we need to
                  know everything that happened between
                  you and Mr. Lombardo.
                         (beat)
                  Are you ready?

     Kelly nods.

     CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - KELLY'S STATEMENT

                                  KELLY
                  He started rubbing my shoulders.  Said
                  must be sore after washing cars.  I...
                  let him  I mean he's a nice guy.
                         (beat)
                  I don't know... It was so fast.  I
                  closed my eyes.  I remember his hands
                  moved to my breasts.  I mean just for a
                  second it was nice... I forgot whore I
                  was.  I mean he's so gorgeous...

     PULL BACK to REVEAL...

     INT. STATION HOUSE - DAY

     Ray, Gloria and Bryce Hunter stand at one end of the long
     conference table, watching the playback of Kelly's tape.

     BACK TO VIDEOTAPE

                                  KELLY
                  The next thing... his hand was in my
                  shorts... you know, from behind.  His
                  fingers... his fingers...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Take your time.

                                  KELLY
                  They were in me.  Both places... you
                  know.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  I understand.

                                  KELLY
                  He said something like, "Do you want it
                  dirty7" or something.
                         (beat)
                  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me
                  to the floor.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Was there penetration?  Did he put
                  himself inside you?

                                  KELLY
                  Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean
                  that's how it sounded in my head.  He
                  hurt me...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                         (as Kelly breaks into
                          tears)
                  That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.
                         (beat)
                  But I have to ask you something here.
                  When you say it hurt.  Was this the
                  first time a man was inside you?

                                  KELLY
                  No.  I've done it a couple of times, I
                  mean with guys I dated.  But this
                  hurt... like, he was built... you
                  know...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  He was large?


     Kelly nods, starts to break down again, then holds it off.

                                  GLORIA (O.S., CONT'D)
                  Did you try to fight him?

                                  KELLY
                  I... he had my wrists pinned behind me.
                  I remember my hands were cold.'

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Then what?

                                  KELLY
                  He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it
                  happen."  Then he just stopped.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  You mean he withdrew...

                                  KELLY
                  Not at first.  He was still inside but
                  he wasn't moving or anything...  He said
                  we had this secret.  And that now he'd
                  be able to help me... because we were
                  close... Something like that.  I don't
                  know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Try, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                  I know one thing he said.  It was
                  when... when he took himself out and was
                  standing up.
                         (beat)
                  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come."
                  I can't forget that.  He said, "No
                  little girl can ever make me come."

     The tape is paused -- FREEZES on Kelly's face ON SCREEN.

     BACK TO RAY, GLORIA & HUNTER

                                  HUNTER
                  "No little girl can ever make me come."
                  Jesus.  Too bad.  We might have some
                  physical evidence.

     Ray and Gloria stare at the screen.

                                  GLORIA
                  I don't know.  It feels wrong.

     Ray and Hunter look at her.

                                  HUNTER
                  Why?

                                  GLORIA
                  I think she's acting.  I think she set
                  it up to be alone with him because she
                  wanted him to come on to her.
                         (beat)
                  I think maybe she's upset that he
                  didn't...

                                  RAY
                  Or maybe she thought that was what she
                  wanted and she got a little more than
                  she bargained for...

                                  HUNTER
                  The line I get on this guy, is that he's
                  done half the women in Blue Bay.

                                  GLORIA
                  That doesn't make him a child rapist.
                         (beat)
                  There's something else.  This girl's had
                  some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her
                  mom's cars.  Ran away...

                                  HUNTER
                  Where's this coming from?

                                  GLORIA
                  I worked Juvenile in Dade County for
                  three years.  We had a missing persons
                  on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe
                  a year ago... The family kept it out of
                  the papers.

                                  RAY
                  That would make it about the time of her
                  old man's suicide.  You don't think that
                  could explain some erratic behavior?

                                  GLORIA
                  All I'm saying is, I think we should go
                  slow here.

     Hunter puts his hands together, thinking.  He looks from Ray to
     Gloria, than back to Ray.

                                  HUNTER
                  I want a full-scale investigation.

                                  GLORIA
                  You know what that will mean for
                  Lombardo.

                                  HUNTER
                  I don't care.  You heard that girl's
                  statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me
                  a case.

     Gloria and Ray watch as Hunter gets up and leaves the room.

                                  GLORIA
                  Well you were a big help.  You know
                  what's going to happen if we go
                  full-bore on this.

     Ray looks at the screen.

                                  RAY
                  It's our job, Gloria.

                                  GLORIA
                  Hunter's making it our job because
                  Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass.
                  You know that as well as I do.
                         (beat)
                  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I
                  keep asking myself if it's really
                  necessary.

     Ray thinks this over.  He continues to study the screen.

     CLOSE ON SCREEN - KELLY'S FACE

                                  RAY (0.S.)
                  Yeah, well, maybe you're wrong about
                  him.  Maybe he's got it coming.

     BEGIN MONTAGE - INVESTIGATION

     EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

     Ray takes notes, talks with neighbors, kids, lawn mower man.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DRIVEWAY - DAY

     Gloria talks with students -- Jimmy, Nicole, others.

     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

     Sam sits at his desk, toying with a pencil.  He watches students
     pass -- no smiles, no waves, an occasional dark look.

     Through the press of students Sam sees Art at the door of his
     office.  The two men look at one another.  At which point...

     Gloria, followed by Ray, steps INTO SCENE.  The detectives shake
     hands with Art.  As Art turns to close the door, Sam falls within
     his line of vision.  Art looks away.  The door swings shut.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL DOCKS - LATER

     The sky has begun to color.  Art Maddox stands on the grass at
     the end of the channel separating the slips, watching as...

     A lone sailboat tacks toward the school.

     ANGLE ON BOAT - SAM & JIMMY

     Sam drops his sail, leaving himself just enough momentum to
     cruise expertly into the little channel then into the slip.

     Art watches as Jimmy jumps from the boat, ties it off.

                                  SAM
                  That's good, Jimbo.  I'll see you on
                  Monday.

     Jimmy hesitates, he wants to say something.  Sam waves him off.
     Jimmy gives Art a hard look and heads for the grass.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                         (to Art, nodding after
                          Jimmy)
                  What's left of my sailing class.

     Art studies the dock between his feet.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Talk to me Artie.

                                  ART
                  Kelly Van Ryan...

                                  SAM
                  ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told
                  me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...

                                  ART
                  Sam... I...
                         (a long beat)
                  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with
                  every member of the school board all day
                  long.  She's pushing for suspension...

                                  SAM
                  This is insane.

     Art shakes his head.

                                  ART
                  All I can tell you Sam, is hang in
                  there.  They clear you of this mess, you
                  get reinstated, with back pay...

                                  SAM
                  That's great.  I'll just tell my
                  creditors I'm not a rapist.  No
                  problem... Shit.
                         (beat)
                  I can't believe the board's going to act
                  without even hearing my side of it.

                                  ART
                  The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay.
                  They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan
                  calls up the board and says kiss my ass,
                  they say, left, right, or in the middle.
                         (beat)
                  You're gonna need some help on this one,
                  Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and
                  he'd better be a good one.

     EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

     Typical of its kind -- a Blockbuster Video, a 7-Eleven, half a
     dozen small businesses, one of which, sandwiched between a donut
     shop and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, bears the sign:  "KEN BOWDEN --
     ATTORNEY AT LAW."

     INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

     Sam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine.

     An attractive young SECRETARY sits a few feet away, behind her
     desk.  Her PHONE RINGS.  She picks it up, then turns to Sam,
     favoring him with a flirtatious smile.

                                  SECRETARY
                  Mr. Bowden will see you now.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Ken Bowden, a slightly oily-looking young man in a nice suit and
     a large, padded neck brace, rises to shake Sam's hand.

                                  KEN
                  Sam, hey, it's been a while.
                         (beat)
                  Looked for you at the ten year reunion.
                  You missed out.  Three days at the
                  Disneyworld Hotel... Partied ourselves
                  silly.

     Sam nods.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Couple of your old flames were there.
                  You remember Jill, with the knockers.

     Ken holds his hands out in front of his chest.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Blew up like the Goodyear blimp.

     Sam forces a smile.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  But check this...

                                  SAM
                         (interrupting)
                  Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an
                  attorney and you're the only one I know.
                  So I figured I'd start here.

     Ken stops, puts on a serious face.

                                  KEN
                  Well, I'm glad you did.  And I'm sorry.
                         (folding his hands before
                          him)
                  Why don't you tell me about it.

     Sam looks at him.  He starts to speak, then checks himself.

                                  SAM
                  What did you do to your neck?

     Ken puts a hand to his throat, as if aware of the brace for the
     first time.

                                  KEN
                  Oh this... chiropractor did a number on
                  me.

     He takes the brace off, tossing it on his desk.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  I don't really have to wear the thing
                  all the time.
                         (beat)
                 A guy from the insurance was here.

     Ken smiles.  Sam looks slightly ill.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Go ahead, Sam.  Shoot.  Let's see what
                  we've got here.

     EXT. A BLUE HAY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Trendy nouveau.  A valet parks Sam's Jeep.

     INT. RESTAURLNT - SAME

     Sam walks across a tiled entry.  He looks tired, but smiles at
     the maitre d'.

                                  SAM
                  Georgie, hey.  I'm meeting Barbara.  She
                  here yet?

     GEORGE looks stiff, maybe a little nervous.  Sam picks up on it.
     He scans the room...

     ANGLE ON ROOM

     Dimly-lit, crowded, but we PICK OUT Barbara, stunning in a
     delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table.

     Sam starts toward her.  George reaches out to touch his arm.

                                  GEORGE
                  Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish
     bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her
     father, Tom Baxter.

     Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet.

                                  BAXTER
                  This is not appropriate Lombardo.

     Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara.

     Barbara has tears in her eyes.  She looks at Sam, then shakes her
     head, looking away.

                                  SAM
                  Barbara...

                                  BAZTER
                  You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo.
                  You've been scratching at the door long
                  enough...
                         (as Sam faces him)
                  I ever see you around my daughter,
                  you're going to be finished, period.

     The two men square off, but already we can SEE Georgie, trailed
     by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way
     across the room.

     Sam sees them too.  He takes a final look at Barbara.  When she
     refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd
     and out of the restaurant.

     EXT. AN EVERGLADES ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

     Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room.  A handful of
     trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them.

     INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

     The air is thick with smoke.  Locals shoot pool.  The walls are
     decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish.

     An aging BARMAID -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a
     pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding...

     Sam, alone, awaiting service.

                                  BARMAID
                  Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a
                  while.  How's life treatin' you?
                         (off Sam's look)
                  That bad, huh?  Well, you came to the
                  right place.

     EXT. ROADHOUSE - LATER

     Sam walks outside.  He stands in the red glow of neon light,
     looking toward the road... On the opposite side of which...

     ... sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco
     bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel.

     Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness.

     Sam stares at the motel.  At last he gets in his Jeep.  As he
     EXITS the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     A deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp.  Trees bearded
     with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep.

     INT./EXT. SAM'S JEEP - MOVING - SAME

     San drives -- a tired face.  Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.

     Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the
     headlights.  Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...

     A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.

     Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of
     something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview
     mirror, coming fast.  Sam watches as the lights get closer.  He
     looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...

     Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him.  A black Range
     Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane,
     cutting him off.

     It happens quickly.  Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car,
     but the road affords little margin for error.

     The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a
     steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM
     BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.

     Sam slumps back from the steering wheel.  Somewhere over his head
     he can see headlights shining into the trees.

     He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down
     the embankment.

     Sam tries to get out of his seat harness.  Someone is
     approaching, splashing through the muck.  Suddenly a hand reaches
     through the broken driver's window, helping him.

                                  MAN'S VOICE
                  Are you all right?

     The hands get him loose.  Sam stumbles from the car.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, I'm okay.

     He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.

                                  FRANKIE
                  That's too bad.

     He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME.  What we are left with is
     the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the
     hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.

     Frankie is breathing hard.  We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the
     embankment.  We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away,
     leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.

     EXT. THE STRIP MALL - DAY

     Dazzling light.  Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken
     Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl.

     INT. BEEF BOWL - SAME

     Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken
     with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face.

                                  KEN
                  I figured, you know, it would be darker
                  in here.

     He moves a hand to his face.

                                  SAM
                  Good thinking.

                                  KEN
                  You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van
                  Ryan...

                                  SAM
                  Forget it.

                                  KEN
                  Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all
                  I'm saying.

                                  SAM
                  I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I
                  thought I might be able to save my
                  fucking house with an equity loan.
                  Guess who's on the board of directors at
                  the bank?

     He pauses to look at Ken Bowden.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Can't you take that stupid thing off?

                                  KEN
                  Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here
                  for lunch sometimes.

     San sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  You're not in bad shape, really.  I know
                  you think you are, but you're not.  Let
                  me tell you why.
                         (beat)
                  Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  SAM
                  What's that supposed to mean?

                                  KEN
                  For you to be getting this kind of heat,
                  for what they have on you... It doesn't
                  add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em
                  running scared.

                  And I'll tell you something else, you
                  rush, you get careless.

     Ken reaches into his briefcase.  He pulls out some papers, tosses
     them on the table.  Sam picks one up, starts to read.

                                  SAM
                  Nellie Gail Ranch...

                                  KEN
                  Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab
                  farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went
                  when her morn fished her out of the
                  swamp.
                         (beat)
                  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year
                  I mean there's no way they can put
                  this thing in front of a jury.
                         (beat)
                  Shit, they haven't even taken your
                  statement yet.  Reason?  They're still
                  shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're
                  coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.

                                  SAM
                  There's nothing for them to get.

                                  KEN
                  Good.  So what we're going to do is
                  march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're
                  going to insist they take a statement.
                  We're going to tell them to charge your
                  ass or get off your back.
                         (beat)
                  They're walking a fine line here.
                  Defamation of character, malicious
                  prosecution...

                                  SAM
                  I just want my life back...

                                  KEN
                  Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.

     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Everyone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of
     Ray.  At this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at Sam.

                                  RAY
                  Why don't you tell us one more time, how
                  Kelly came to be with you, alone in your
                  house.

                                  SAM
                         (with growing impatience)
                  Story's the same, Detective...

     Ken pats him on the arm.  When Sam speaks again, it is in a
     calmer voice, calm but tired.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  I had to go look for this coupon.

                                  RAY
                  The one you bought at school.

                                  SAM
                         (nodding)
                  Like I said, I hadn't really expected to
                  use it.
                         (beat)
                  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I
                  hear a car.  I look out the window.  I
                  see Nicole driving away.  I leave my
                  room, and there's Kelly.

                                  RAY
                  In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.

                                  RAY
                  And she wanted to talk.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.

                                  RAY
                  But you can't tell us what she wanted to
                  talk about.

                                  SAM
                  I could, but it's confidential.  Look,
                  the point is, we didn't talk.  I told
                  her this was not an appropriate time or
                  place.

                                  RAY
                  And she began to cry.  And you put an
                  arm around her.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the
                  door.  I told her we would talk on
                  Monday, in the office.

                                  GLORIA
                  And when you turned her toward the door,
                  where did you expect her to go, without
                  a car?

                                  SAM
                  Again.  I think we covered this.  I told
                  her I was going to call a cab.

                                  RAY
                  But she ran away.

                                  SAM
                  That's right.

                                  GLORIA
                  Did you call anyone?  Did you call her
                  house to see if she got home?  Did you
                  call the Masons?

                                  SAM
                  No.

                                  GLORIA
                  Weren't you a little worried about
                  her...?

                                  SAM
                  There's a strip mall not half a mile
                  from my house.  There's phones there.  I
                  cruised the place, but I didn't see her.
                  I figured she was probably there but
                  that she was angry and didn't want to be
                  found.  I don't know... Maybe I should
                  have called.  But it's not like Kelly
                  can't take care of herself.  I figured
                  we'd just take it up on Monday, in the
                  office.

     There is a moment of silence in the room.

                                  RAY
                  But you do admit to touching her, to
                  putting your arm around her.  Isn't that
                  against the rules?

                                  SAM
                  It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...
                         (beat)
                  But, I mean... there's this kid standing
                  in front of you crying...

                                  RAY
                  With a thirty-five inch bustline in a
                  wet T-shirt with no bra...

     He is cut short as Sam shoves his chair back from the table.

                                  SAM
                  Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta
                  here.

                                  RAY
                  Sit down, Lombardo.

     Sam and Ray stare at one another.  Ken puts a hand on his
     client's arm.

                                  KEN
                  All right, all right... Enough.

     Ken stands up.  He walks to the two-way mirror set in one wall,
     rapping on the glass with his knuckles.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  We came down here to make a statement.
                  We've made it.
                         (beat)
                  If you're going to charge my client, do
                  it now.

     INT. OPPOSITE SIDE MIRROR ROOM - HUNTER

     stares at Ken's face, about a foot away.  Ken of course can't see
     him.  Hunter gives him the finger.

     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - KEN

     stares into the mirror, waiting.

                                  KEN
                  I didn't think so.
                         (to Sam)
                  Let's go.

     Ken opens the door.  Sam turns back to Ray and Gloria.

                                  SAM
                  I've spent the last ten years of my life
                  working with kids.  I love what I do,
                  and I think I'm good at it.
                         (beat)
                  These kids trust me, and there is no
                  way.  No way in hell I would ever betray
                  that trust.

     As Ken and Sam leave, Ray and Gloria are joined by Bryce Hunter.

                                  HUNTER
                  Nice speech.  Either of you buying?

     Ray shrugs.

                                  RAY
                  Not that stuff about her running away,
                  him trying to find her.  That's
                  bullshit.

                                  HUNTER
                  What about witnesses?

                                  RAY
                  We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard,
                  couple of kids playing hoops.

                                  HUNTER
                  And what do they say?

                                  GLORIA
                  Same as him.  They saw her come.  They
                  saw her go.  They saw him follow.

                                  RAY
                  Still doesn't explain why he couldn't
                  catch up with her.  I mean how long does
                  it take to put on a shirt?

     At which point, a COP APPEARS in the doorway.

                                  COP
                  Phone, Bryce.  It's Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  HUNTER
                  Christ Almighty.  That woman's calling
                  me six times a day.

     He starts away, then stops.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  I think you're onto something, Ray.
                  Stay with it.

     Hunter bangs out of the room.  Gloria slumps in a chair, tired,
     disgusted.

                                  GLORIA
                  We failed to mention the mower guy's a
                  drunk, that he was after more beer and
                  never really saw Kelly go into the
                  house, so he can't say how long she was
                  in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw
                  her running down the street, but that's
                  it.
                         (beat)
                  With no physical evidence, what do we
                  have?  Her word against his.

                                  RAY
                  You're telling me you believe the guy?

                                  GLORIA
                  All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van
                  Ryan push us too hard, we're going to
                  wind up looking stupid.

     Ray is paged by his BEEPER.  He pulls it off his belt, looks at
     the number.

                                  RAY
                  I'd better return this.

     Ray leaves.  Gloria pulls a cigarette from her purse and lights
     up, rests her head back in the chair, blowing smoke at the
     ceiling.

     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

     Gloria is grinding out the butt as Ray walks back in.  There is
     something in the way he carries himself, some sense of urgency.

                                  RAY
                         (off Gloria's look)
                  Seen any good gator wrestling lately?

     EXT./INT. DETECTIVES' CAR - MOVING - DAY

     Ray and Gloria drive through the Everglades, past marshlands
     punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees.

                                  GLORIA
                  They say it was old man Van Ryan planted
                  the melalucas to dry up the swamp.

     Ray nods.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  You can go up to one of those trees and
                  peel the bark.  You know what you get?
                  More bark.  And more bark.  There's no
                  core.  Tree's not good tar anything but
                  sucking up water.  And now they can't
                  get rid of them.  They've tried poisons.
                  Nothing works.  They don't die.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't
                  imagine he gives a shit now.

     Gloria just looks at him.  Ray stares into the dusty light of an
     approaching sunset.  At last he slows, turning off the highway
     and onto a narrow dirt road.

     A sign pokes out from the tall grass -- "SMILIN' JACK'S FISH
     CAMP."

     The Taurus bounces along the washboard road.

     They are driving now at the edge of a canal.

                                  RAY
                  You remember that little girl walked out
                  of our talk at Blue Bay?

                         (beat)
                  Beats the shit out of me why she would
                  call me at all.  I busted her once for
                  possession.  she wound up doing about
                  six months at Camp Nine.

                                  GLORIA
                  You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.

     Ray gives her a look.  Gloria shrugs.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  That's what they called it when I was in
                  Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.

                                  RAY
                  It's a shithole.  But she was dirty,
                  what was I gonna do?

     They pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run
     of shabby trailers and cheap shacks.

     The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of
     the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished
     brass beneath an immense, darkening sky.

     Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and
     peeling paint.  A sign reads:  "NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET."  The
     jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.

     As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye --
     along the bank of the canal...

     ANGLE ON BANK

     where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms
     kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.  The
     reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws.

     Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the
     gator's mouth.  The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a
     hollow snapping sound.

     Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps
     the creature once more.  This time moving round to the front of
     the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.

                                  VOICE (0.5.)
                  He's just showin' off for you now.

     Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up
     beside her.  The woman is in her sixties.  She's dressed in
     polyester.  Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to
     be anything but a dye job.  A cigarette bobs from her lips.

     Before Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than.

                                  RAY
                  Evening Ruby.
                         (beat)
                  I see you still got Walter.  I was sort
                  of hoping something had eaten him by
                  now.

                                  RUBY
                         (a long beat)
                  Can I help you with something?

     Ray and the old lady look at each other.

                                  RAY
                  Suzie called.  You know where we can
                  find her?

     Ruby looks toward the store.

                                  RUBY
                  You know the way.

     She watches as the detectives CROSS the road, then calls to them
     as they start up the steps.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  You won't shoot her will you?  I don't
                  believe she's armed.

     Gloria turns, surprised.  Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare,
     then opens the door for Gloria.

     INT. CAMP STORE - SAME

     It's dark inside.  The main light source is a tiny, beat-up
     black-and-white TV.

     Two elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old
     couch watching reruns of "Family Feud."  They look up as Ray and
     Gloria ENTER then EXIT through a door in the back.

     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - SAME

     Black walls.  Cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing.  A wire
     strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room.

     Suzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach,
     her thin, white arms crossed behind her head.

                                  SUZIE
                  Jesus.  It took you long enough.  What
                  if somebody was trying to strangle me?
                  Or fuck me in the ass, even?
                         (beat)
                  I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes.

     Ray manages a thin smile.

                                  RAY
                  Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.

                                  SUZIE
                  I did.  At Blue Balls.

                                  GLORIA
                  Seems to me you left early, before we
                  could meet.  But hi, Suzie.

     Gloria puts out a hand.  Suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of
     her own.

     As the women shake, Gloria looks at the book on Suzie's stomach,
     turning her head as if to read the title.

                                  SUZIE
                  It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a
                  pretty good line on what cheap fucks
                  people are.

                                  RAY
                  So Suzie, you called us, remember?

     Suzie takes a cigarette from a pack at her side, lights up, blows
     smoke at the ceiling.

                                  SUZIE
                  Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

     Ray and Gloria exchange looks.

                                  RAY
                  No.

                                  SUZIE
                  Will they?

                                  RAY
                  It doesn't look like it.

                                  SUZIE
                  Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?

     Ray shrugs.

                                  GLORIA
                  That bothers you?

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Yeah, maybe, a little.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why is that?

     Suzie lets out her breath.  She rests her head against the wall.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  You can talk to us, Suzie.  That's why
                  we're here...

     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Suzie, Gloria and Hunter sit at the conference table.  Ray
     operates the video cam.

                                  GLORIA
                  Okay, Suzie.  We want you to tell us
                  about the day Mr. Lombardo gave you and
                  Jimmy a ride.

       Suzie stares at the three cops around her, then at the camera.

                                  SUZIE
                  You didn't tell me you were gonna put me
                  on the fucking news.

                                  GLORIA
                  We need to tape the interview, Suzie.
                  No one will see it but us.
                         (beat)
                  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo
                  gave you the ride?

     Suzie stares at the camera.  She's lost the cockiness she had on
     her own turf.  She looks small, white and frail in the sterile
     room, surrounded by the detectives.

                                  SUZIE
                  About a year ago.

                                  GLORIA
                  He dropped Jimmy off first?

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah.

                                  GLORIA
                  And when he arrived at your house, was
                  anyone there?

                                  SUZIE
                  No.

                                  GLORIA
                  So you were alone.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yes.

                                  GLORIA
                  Did he come in with you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I guess.

                                  HUNTER
                  You guess?  Did he or didn't he?

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah... okay... he did

                                  HUNTER
                  And then what... he touched you?  Did
                  you maybe flirt a little...

                                  SUZIE
                  I wanna go home now.

     Gloria glares at Hunter, shakes her head.

                                  GLORIA
                  Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.  I
                  know it's harder to talk here than in
                  your room, but we need to get it on
                  tape.
                         (beat)
                  Just tell us what you told us before.
                  Tell us the truth.

     Suzie huddles in her skinny arms, studying the detectives.

                                  SUZIE
                  I didn't say a thing to him.  He just
                  put his arm around me.  Told me I was
                  pretty... I could be really pretty, he
                  said.

   Another moment -- she looks at Ray, then at Hunter.

                                  HUNTER
                  What did you do then?

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Shit, what difference does it make...
                  Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...

                                  HUNTER
                  Suzie!  Did this man rape you?

                                  SUZIE
                  Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the
                  floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I
                  go home?

     She stands up.

                                  GLORIA
                  At that point were you able to fight him
                  off?

                                  SUZIE
                  No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay?
                  That's all.  Let me go.

     Gloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around
     Suzie.  The girl jumps back as if she has been shocked.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Don't touch me.

     Gloria's hands fall to her sides.

     Suzie heads for the door.


     The detectives exchange looks.
         
     At which point, Suzie stops, turns to face the room.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  He did say something.

                                  GLORIA
                  What was that?

                                  SUZIE
                  He said, "No little bitch can ever make
                  me come."

     Kelly Van Ryan sits in the witness box, dabbing her eyes with a

                  Do you need more time?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  I know this is hard, Kelly, but I have
                  just one more question and even though
                  its something we've been over, I want us

     Ray and Gloria watch her, exchange glances.  Gloria picks up
     Suzie's cigarette for her, puts it out in an ashtray.

     PANNING the spectators, we SEE Sandra, Baxter, Ray, Gloria.

     Hunter is on the witness stand.

     Suzie is in the box.  She looks pale, even more nervous.

                                  SUZIE
                  He pushed into me... I couldn't stop
                  him... it hurt.

                                  HUNTER
                  I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?

                                  SUZIE
                  Because... it was the biggest I've ever

                  Ms. Toller, did Samuel Lombardo rape you
                  in your family's home on the 23rd of
                  April last year?

     Suzie glances at Sam, hesitates.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  Ms. Toller?

                  I said he did.

                                  HUNTER
                  Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under
                  oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?

     Suzie looks around, as if for help.  The spectators stir.
     Ray rubs his eyes.  Gloria's are closed.

                                  SUZIE
                  This wasn't my idea.

                                  HUNTER
                  I'm sorry?

     Suzie looks at Sam once more.

                                  SUZIE
                  Look.  I just don't want to get into any
                  more trouble...

     Tom Baxter rises to his feet.  The Judge raises a hand, motioning
     him to sit back down.

                                 JUDGE
                         (to Baxter)
                  The Court would like to hear what Miss
                  Toller has to say.
                         (to Suzie)
                  Miss Toller.

                                 SUZIE
                  Mr. Lombardo didn't rape me.  He didn't
                  rape Kelly either.  He didn't do
                  anything.

     QUICK CUTS

     Hunter slumps back against the prosecution table.

     Sandra's hand covers her mouth.  Baxter mumbles a curse.

     Sam hangs his head in relief.  Ken grins above his neck brace.

     COURTROOM LOBBY

     The press corps scrambles for cameras.

     BLUE BAY HIGS

     Teachers, students, Art, Jimmy -- crammed around the TV.

                                  JIMMY
                  I don't believe it...

     IN THE COURTROOM

     Bryce Hunter and Tom Baxter are both on their feet, trying to
     make themselves heard above the din.

                                  HUNTER
                  Your Honor... I must object...

                                  JUDGE
                         (hammering for order)
                  I think I made it plain that the Court
                  intends to near Miss Toller's story.

     The Judge turns a cold eye on Suzie.

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm sorry.

                                  JUDGE
                  Sorry?  Just how far did you intend to
                  let this go?

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't know.  I just wanted to hurt Mr.
                  Lombardo.

     Sam looks up, confused.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  He was my friend at first.  Then I got
                  busted... he didn't even stick up for
                  me.  I had to go away to that hellhole.
                  It's like, you're his favorite, then who
                  cares?  You wanna know something?  When
                  Kelly said we should do this, I thought
                  cool, all these big shots screwing me
                  over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now
                  they're gonna get screwed.

                                  HUNTER
                  Your Honor... Please...

                                  JUDGE
                  Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter, and
                  the Court will hold you in contempt.
                         (to Suzie)
                  What you are telling me, Ms. Toller, is
                  that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible for
                  conceiving this entire charade...

                                  SUZIE
                  Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too.
                  She's in love with him.  I mean her
                  whole fantasy is him since her old man
                  died.  Then she found out that Mr.
                  Lombardo was doing her mom.  I mean that
                  was it...

     Gasps in the court as --

     Kelly BURSTS from the witness waiting room, trailed by a bailiff.

                                  KELLY
                  You stupid little bitch...

     She grabs the first thing she can get her hands on -- a glass of
     water from one of the tables and hurls it toward the witness
     stand before the bailiff can pin her arms against her sides.

     INT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER

     A mob scene.  Video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as
     Sandra and Baxter, with Kelly in tow, move toward a side door.

     Sam and Ken round a corner, followed by Ray and Gloria who walk
     on either side of Suzie.

     Kelly sees them.  She makes a run at Suzie.  For a moment the
     girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a
     hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of
     Kelly, pulling her toward the door.

     Ruby and Walter arrive now too.  Suzie runs to them and they lead
     her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long,
     tattooed arms.

     Gloria heaves a sigh.  Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then
     turns to find Sam looking at him.  Most of the press have run off
     to follow the girls -- looking for more action.  It is a quiet
     moment.  The two men lock eyes.

                                  SAM
                  I've found that adolescents make the
                  best liars.  They're old enough to be
                  good at it, but you want like hell to
                  believe them, because they're still
                  children.

     Ray just looks at him -- a hard stare.

     EXT./INT. KEN'S T-BIRD - DAY

     top down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue
     Atlantic on the other.

     Wind buffets Ken and Sam -- who has a dazed look.

                                  KEN
                         (hyped)
                  Come on, let loose!

                                  SAM
                  I was just thinking about where I'm
                  gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's
                  like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.

                                  KEN
                  You'll get over it. We've got a
                  knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a
                  lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  SAM
                  Just like that?

                                  KEN
                  Just like that?  These people ruined
                  your life, bro.

     Ken pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  I told you they were going overboard and
                  they did... They'll settle.  Believe me.
                  They'll be begging to settle...

     At which point Ken spots something up ahead.  His smile broadens.
     He swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as...

     The T-bird draws even with a sleek black limo.

                                  SAM
                  You don't think you're overdoing it?

     He pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of Sam's face,
     then tosses it out the window.

     INT. LIMO - MOVING - SAME

     Tom Baxter watches as the T-bird rockets off into the distance, a
     white piece of foam rubber bouncing across the road in its wake.

     A console TV is on -- news of the courthouse chaos.

     Sandra is next to Baxter.  Kelly is on the opposite bench seat.

                                  SANDRA
                  I hope you're going to nail his scrotum
                  to the nearest wall.

                                  BAXTER
                  That might have been a possibility, if
                  little miss not-so-bright here hadn't
                  started throwing things.

                                  KELLY
                  Fuck off.

   Sandra lunges to slap Kelly.  Baxter stops it in midair.

                                  BAXTER
                  See what I mean...

                                  SANDRA
                  You're going to let them get away with
                  this... this shit?  On the word of one
                  little white trash bitch...

                                  BAXTER
                  You like seeing your name in the papers?

     Sandra glares at him.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  Leave town, Sandy.  Go to your place in
                  St. Barts.  Let things cool down.

     Sandra concentrates on the TV.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  They'll try for twenty million.  The
                  cheaper the lawyer, the higher the
                  demand.

                                  SANDRA
                  You've got to be kidding.

                                  HAXTER
                  The man's life has been destroyed.
                  There will always be doubters, no matter
                  what happened in court.

                                  SANDRA
                  I'm not paying any idiot twenty million
                  dollars.

                                  BAXTER
                  I said that's what they'd ask for.

     Sandra stares from the window.  At last she turns to Kelly.
         
                                  SANDRA
                  I hope you're happy.

     Kelly seems to give this a moment's thought, then, smiling.

                                  KELLY
                  Ecstatic.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY

     Sam cruises slowly across the water in his junked-out air boat.
     He kills the engine, allowing the craft to glide to a stop.

     He's close to where he found the big gator -- the same shabby
     collection of whitewashed buildings we now RECOGNIZE as the
     Glades Motel, shimmers in the distance.

     Sam leans back, enjoying the silence.  He reaches into a cooler,
     takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something
     else from the cooler --

     -- a bundle of white butcher's paper.  Sam opens the paper, takes
     out raw meat -- something disgusting to look at -- big red turkey
     necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water.

     ANGLE ON WATER

     as the meat drifts down -- then, a sudden boiling, as -- quick as
     the strike of a snake -- the huge gator EMERGES, jaws wide, to
     snap up the morsel before slipping beneath the surface once mare.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

     Ken's Secretary opens the inner office door for Baxter.
     Ken rises from a desk to greet him.

                                  KEN
                  Tom Baxter.  Good to see you again.

                                  BAXTER
                  Let's cut the crap.  What does your
                  client want?

                                  KEN
                  Besides an apology?

                                  BAXTER
                  Unless you're planning on leaving Blue
                  Bay, there's gonna be other cases, other
                  days... You might want to keep that in
                  mind.

                                  KEN
                  Okay Tom.  My client wants your client
                  to saddle up... so we can ride her ass
                  all the way to the bank.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     A hot morning in June.  Shadows angle across the campus.

     Students line up at the old wooden pagoda, picking up caps and
     gowns.  A few turn, surprised to see...

     SAM LOMBARDO cross the parking lot, ENTERS a building.

     INT. ART'S OFFICE - ART

     working at his desk.  Sam's terrarium is behind him, his
     "Educator of the Year" Waterford bowl, a storage box of files.

     Art looks up at a KNOCK on the DOOR.  Sam walks into the room.
     It is a slightly awkward moment.

                                  SAM
                  Lizards don't seem to miss me.

     The two men smile, breaking the tension.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  How you doing, Artie?

                                  ART
                  I... You know... I...

     Sam waves him off.

                                  SAM
                  Take care of my lizards, Art.

     Art stands up.  The two men shake hands.

     OUTSIDE GUIDANCE OFFICE

     Sam comes out, then stops suddenly.

     Kelly waits for him.  Kirk and Nicole are with her.  A long
     moment.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly...

                                  KELLY
                  Drop dead... You know where my mom is
                  trying to get the money to pay you off?
                  She's trying to break my trust.  How do
                  you like that?  I can't touch it until
                  she's dead and she won't give me a dime
                  and now she's trying to break it to pay
                  you...

                                  SAM
                  Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what
                  you've been through... I should've seen
                  something like this coning.

     Art APPEARS in the door behind Sam.  Kelly cones closer.

                                  KELLY
                  Why don't you start fucking her again.
                  You can spend it together.

     Kirk tries to take Kelly's arm.  She jerks away, swings at Sam.

     He ducks, dropping the Waterford BOWL, which SHATTERS upon the
     floor.

     Kirk bear-hugs Kelly.  She throws a notebook at Sam.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  I hate you!

     She starts crying.  Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd
     gathers.

     Sam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.  Art bends to help
     him pick up the pieces.

                                  SAM
                  You see.  I couldn't stay, even if I
                  wanted to.

     EXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT

     Sam's Jeep is parked next to the T-bird and Jaguar.

     INT. KEN'S OFFICE - SAME

     Baxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers.
     At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment.

     Sandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room.
     Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam.

                                  FRANKIE
                  I'll be seeing you.

     Sam just looks at him.  The big man leaves.  Baxter closes his
     briefcase.

                                  KEN
                  So long, Tom.  Come by sometime.  We'll
                  have lunch at the Beef Bowl.

     Baxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile.

                                  BAXTER
                  I don't think you're gonna be eating at
                  the Beef Bowl anymore, kid.

     He EXITS.  Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk,
     drops into his chair, holds up the documents.

     Sam watches, smiling, finally.

                                  SAM
                  Thanks Ken, you did okay.

     Both men stand, they shake hands.  Ken claps him on the arm.

                                  KEN
                         (no clowning now)
                  Look, I know there's a part of you
                  wishes none of this had happened.  But
                  it did.  Now take the money and get out
                  of here.  Find a happy place.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     Moonlit fog -- the vast swamp.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     It's late.  A neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as...

     Sam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow.
     Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear.

     INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

     The neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old
     Venetian blinds.

     Sam ENTERS, puts the file box on the floor.  Arches a sore back.

     He reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's
     nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening...

     BZZZZZ -- the high-pitched WHINE of a MOSQUITO.  Then more -- a
     flurry of BZZZZZZZZS

     Sam frowns, sees...

     A cloud of mosquitoes circling him.

     He checks the front windows -- closed.  He goes around the bed.
     The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up
     on his right.  Ahead is a rear window -- wide open.

     Sam stops fast.
         
     Thinks.  Lets out a breath.

                                  SAM
                  Damn maid.

     He steps to the window.  He looks down --

     Muddy footprints.

     Sam freezes.  He whirls around --

     A sudden green FACE APPEARS in the big mirror -- like a nightmare
     image -- lit by the neon flash, then DISAPPEARS.

     Sam jumps back.

                                  SAM
                  Ahhhh!

     The neon green face flashes again in the mirror -- DISAPPEARS.
     Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way.

     Sam backs up, hits the wall.

     Kelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at
     her side, wrapped in a towel.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

                                  KELLY
                  So you got my mom's money.

     Sam tries to breathe, manages a nod.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  How much?

     Kelly prods him with the concealed object.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  How much?

                                  SAM
                  About six and a half million dollars.

     Kelly raises the abject covered by the towel, aims it at Sam.

                                  KELLY
                  Your turn to pay.

     A moment -- then she yanks the towel away to REVEAL --

     --  a two-foot-long novelty penis with giant balls.  Her hand
     grips the acrylic scrotum like the butt of a gun.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  King Dong!  That's you, Sam!

     She screams with joy, vaults into his arms, wraps those perfect
     thighs around him.  The dildo goes flying.  They fall on the bed.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  It worked!  We screwed the bitch!

     She's all over him now -- tongue kisses.

                                  KELLY CCONT'D)
                  It worked just like you said it would.

     He kisses her, finally gets her to sit, straddling him.

                                  SAM
                  God, you scared the shit out of me.  You
                  must be crazy coming here.

                                  KELLY
                  Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.

     She kisses him again, more passionately now.  He gets into it,
     tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts.

     A SHADOW moves on the wall, looming above them.  Sam sees it, his
     eyes widen.  He tries to sit up, as...

     BANG! -- an EXPLOSION.  Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side.

     A champagne cork hits the ceiling.

     Suzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle.

                                  SUZIE
                  How much is about six and a half million
                  divided by three?

                                  SAM
                  Jesus.  Two million one hundred
                  thirty-three thousand three hundred
                  thirty-three and change.

     Kelly screams in joy again.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Now calm down.  Both of you.

     The girls put on mock serious expressions.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  From now on, if we're seen together,
                  it's got to be accidental.  I thought
                  that was understood...

                                  KELLY
                  Hey, come on... We've got to have at
                  least one victory party.

     Kelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her
     breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them
     clean.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly, for christ's sake...

     She has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her
     breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch...

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  The only way we're gonna blow this now,
                  is if we do it ourselves...

                                  KELLY
                         (her hand in his crotch)
                  Do it to ourselves?

                                  SAM
                         (weakening)
                  We have to stick with the plan.

                                  KELLY
                  Stick?

     Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to
     get him inside her.

     Suzie watches.  She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle,
     pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple
     of tattoos, a pierced nipple.  She slips behind Kelly, fondling
     Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them
     totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex...

                                                 FADE TO:

     INT. DETECTIVZS' ROOM, BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     The room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk
     lamp, by which halo we find...

     Ray Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's
     printer finishes a job, as suddenly...

     ... a new light rushes into the room.  Ray turns to find Gloria
     standing in the doorway.  He stops as his printer finishes the
     job.  He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles.  Gloria walks
     to his desk.

                                  RAY
                  You saw the news today?

                                  GLORIA
                  Lombardo's settlement?

     Ray nods.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna
                  make us look stupid.

     Ray gives her a long look.  Gloria waits a moment, shrugs.

                                  RAY
                  Hey, don't back away from it, you were
                  right.  We did look stupid.
                         (beat)
                  What you were wrong about, is who made
                  us look that way.

     Gloria just looks at him, puzzled.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Think back, before the suit was filed,
                  before the trial.  Lombardo had an
                  affair with Sandra, right?
                         (Gloria nods)
                  So why not tell us about the affair?  I
                  mean it could be a hell of a motive for
                  Kelly to fabricate her charge in the
                  first place.

                                  GLORIA
                  Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the
                  affair for the trial.

                                  RAY
                  I thought of that.  Then I said, come
                  on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is
                  getting trashed.  You want to stop the
                  bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail
                  for three months.  Unless...

                                  GLORIA
                  Unless what?

                                  RAY
                  Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan
                  for the big payday.

     It is quiet in the office, save for the soft BUZZ of Ray's
     COMPUTER.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  They chumped us, Gloria, right from the
                  start.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty
                  good already, nice job in a beautiful
                  setting, popular, an active social life.
                         (beat)
                  He's gonna put this all on the line for
                  some dicey play like what you're
                  describing...

                                  RAY
                         (interrupting)
                  The job looks okay to us.  But look at
                  it from his point of view.  The man's
                  surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But
                  for him... it's just a reminder of what
                  should have been his.

     Gloria gives this a moment's thought.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Your old man graduates from Blue Bay
                  School, you're not supposed to wind up
                  there.  Board of Directors maybe, but
                  not in the lousy guidance office.  Now.
                  Point number two.
                         (he taps at the printout
                          on his desk)
                  I've run a financial on Lombardo.  Guy
                  was eyeball-deep in debt before this all
                  happened -- trying to keep up with
                  pricey trim like Barbara Baxter.

     He passes the printout to Gloria.  She looks at it, thinking.

                                  GLORIA
                  So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor,
                  but why would Kelly have to steal from
                  her own mother?  Surely her father...

                                  RAY
                         (interrupting)
                  Her father didn't leave her squat.  The
                  kid's got money in trust from her
                  grandfather, but she can't touch that
                  till her mother dies and Sandra seems to
                  have the idea that Kelly ought to learn
                  the value of a buck.

     Gloria looks over Lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on
     the desk, then studies Ray -- long beat.

                                  GLORIA
                  This one's got you working overtime,
                  hasn't it?

                                  RAY
                  I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's
                  dirty.  And I'll tell you something
                  else.  You want to know how old man
                  Lombardo lost his money?
                         (beat)
                  He was fucked out of it by old man Van
                  Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt
                  Creek Land Deal.
                         (beat)
                  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a
                  corporation to develop swamp land, got
                  investors like Lombardo to put up money,
                  then turned around and got the state to
                  declare the area an ecological preserve,
                  on the sly, of course, but everyone knew
                  it was him.  The freeway went to the
                  coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.

                                  GLORIA
                  Eliminate the competition.

                                  RAY
                  You got it.  The rich got richer.  While
                  the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in
                  the swamp.

     Gloria looks at him a long moment.

                                  GLORIA
                  Where'd you come up with this stuff,
                  anyway?

                                  RAY
                         (a long beat; then
                          beneath a smile)
                  I net a guy in a bar.

     EXT. A BANK, BLUE BAY - DAY

     Sam walks down the steps, gets into his Jeep, and drives away.

     Across the street -- the white Taurus -- Ray and Gloria watch.

     EXT. YACHT BROKERAGE - DAY

     Sam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone.

     Ray Duquette steps INTO FRAME, turns into the brokerage.  The
     door swings shut behind him.

     INT. SWIMMING POOL, BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off.  As the girls begin
     to walk toward the lockers, they encounter...

     Ray Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on...

     Kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision.

                                  RAY (O.S.)
                  Nice stroke.

     Kelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the
     deck.  She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and
     begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her.

                                 KELLY
                  Is there some reason why you're here?

                                 RAY
                  Curiosity, I guess.

                                 KELLY
                  About what?  How to improve your breast
                  stroke?

     Ray gives her a cold smile.

                                 RAY
                  Actually, I was curious about how you
                  see things working out, for you, Sam and
                  Suzie.

     This appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation.

                                  KELLY
                  Excuse me?

                                  RAY
                  You all gonna go down to the Caribbean
                  together?

     Kelly looks around the pool area.  A number of girls are watching
     from a corner of the deck, but no one is close enough to hear.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  The thing about it is, threesomes so
                  rarely work out.

                                  KELLY
                  You're out of your mind.

                                  RAY
                  I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.
                         (beat)
                  It's hard enough for one person to keep
                  a secret, let alone three.  And then
                  there's the love angle.  I mean do you
                  and Sam really want that little
                  pill-head around, now that you have the
                  money?

     Kelly starts to walk away.  Ray cuts her off.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea
                  right up front, of whacking Suzie?
                  That's murder, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                  Police -- God -- get a life.

     She moves around him and walks calmly away.

                                  RAY
                         (loud enough to make
                          himself heard)
                  You're good.  But you don't think that
                  little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together,
                  do you?

     Kelly continues to walk, her face giving nothing away, as Ray's
     WORDS ECHO over the pool.

     Only a few cars left -- one of them Suzie's old VW bug, at the
     side of which Kelly and Suzie engage in heated conversation.

     CLOSER - SUZIE

     paces around Kelly.

                                  SUZIE
                  You don't know Duquette.  I'm the one he
                  busted... He's a fucker, man... He'll
                  fuck us both over...

     Kelly tries to take her by the arm.  Suzie jerks away.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I'm not going back to that prison.
                  That's what it was... a fucking hell
                  hole...

     Kelly looks around the lot.  She takes Suzie by the arm once
     more, this time more firmly, pulling Suzie to her.

                                  KELLY
                  Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna
                  come to you just like he did to me.
                  You're gonna have to be ready for him.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah, but he can't push you around like
                  he can me.  You've got family and
                  they've got clout.  With we it's
                  different... with me...

                                  KELLY
                         (circling her with her
                          arm)
                  Yeah, I've got family and they've got
                  clout and now you have me.  Right?  And
                  Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's
                  not going to send you anywhere.  He's
                  gonna try and rattle your cage, and
                  that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do
                  shit.

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Man, I wanna smoke a joint.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL -- in the distance -- the white Ford Taurus
     at the side of the road leading to the school.

     The car is pulled just far enough off the road to be mostly
     hidden among pampas grass and oleander, but angled in such a way
     as to afford a view of the two girls now hugging in the lot.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - NIGHT

     Suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a joint.  At her back a
     few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of
     trailers.  She walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail,
     takes another hit.

                                  VOICE (0.S.)
                  'Evening, Suzie.  How was school today?

     Suzie freezes, holds back her exhale, looking around...

     A shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock.  A man
     stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs.  The light from a
     trailer across the road glances off steel-rimmed glasses as Ray
     Duquette steps onto the dock.

     Suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs.  She squeezes the
     lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal.

                                  RAY
                  You ought to watch it with that shit,
                  Suzie.  You get busted again, you go
                  back in a two-tine loser.

                                  SUZIE
                  You got something against cigarettes?

     Ray just laughs at her.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, they're bad for your health.
                         (beat)
                  I'm tryin' to look out for you...

                                  SUZIE
                  That's cop bullshit.

                                  RAY
                  Well, you're half right.  Best thing you
                  could do for yourself right now would be
                  to talk to me.

                                  SUZIE
                  About what?

                                  RAY
                  Every triangle I've ever seen never
                  lasts.  Somebody's got to go.

                                  SUZIE
                  Is this supposed to mean something to
                  me?  What triangle?

                                  RAY
                  You, Kelly, Sam.

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't have to listen to this.  And you
                  can't shove me around.  I have friends
                  now...

     She catches herself, falters.

     Ray laughs once more.

                                  RAY
                  Is that what you think?  You have
                  friends?  Is that what they told you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't mean who you're thinking.  I
                  have other friends...

                                  RAY
                  Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're
                  talking to.  We both know you don't have
                  shit, never have had shit, never will
                  have shit...

     He takes a sheet of paper from his coat.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Here, Suzie.  I want you :o look this
                  over.  Know what it is?
                         (as Suzie takes it)
                  Sam deposited his check, transferred the
                  funds to an offshore bank, a numbered
                  account.  Not even the cops can find out
                  whose names are on it.  Think one of
                  them's yours?

     Suzie looks over the paper.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  He also put a down on some island
                  property, and a lease-to-buy on a
                  forty-foot sailboat.  You're into
                  sailing, aren't you, Suzie?

     Suzie thrusts the paper back at Ray.

                                  SUZIE
                  Get away from me.

                                  RAY
                  Don't you see what this means?  You
                  really think Sam and Kelly are gonna
                  give you a third of the money?  You, the
                  pill-head with the rap sheet?

                                  SUZIE
                  Shut up.

     Ray smiles at her.  He moves up close.

                                  RAY
                  You know, I don't think I ever told you
                  I was sorry about your little friend...
                  What was his name?

     Suzie tries to back away.  She bumps against the rail.  Ray
     reaches out, takes her hand in both of his.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Come on, Suzie, help me out here.  You
                  know his name.

     Suzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before.  When she speaks
     her voice is scarcely above a whisper.

                                  SUZIE
                  Davy.

                                  RAY
                         (nodding, a scary smile)
                  That's right.  That was his name.

     The smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still
     holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Sometimes I wonder if you're really as
                  dumb as you pretend to be.

     He looks into Suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to REVEAL the
     burn mark on her palm.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  But you know what?  I'd be keeping a
                  clear mind right now if I were you.
                         (beat)
                  I'd hate to see you come to a bad end.
                  Like Davy did.

     He holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it.  He goes back
     down he steps to the little skiff.  An outboard MOTOR STARTS in
     the night.

     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Suzie cones in fast, grabs the phone, punches out a number.

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                         (answering machine)
                  This is Sam.  I'm not in right now...

     EXT./INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

     parked behind some cottonwoods in a small launch area where the
     highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp.

     The skiff has been shoved into the bed.  Ray sits at the wheel.
     He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then
     starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired ENGINE, looks up to see...

     HEADLIGHTS

     Suzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the
     highway.

     RAY'S TRUCK - RAY

     watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the
     highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug.

     SXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     Suzie's VW idles.  She leans out the window, talks to the
     intercom, the gate opens.  The VW ENTERS.  The gate closes.

     Ray's pickup drives past.  He drives to a big lot where one of
     the mansions has been torn down.  He drives up onto the dirt,
     keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his
     little skiff out of the back once more.

     He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a
     Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm
     waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, REAR OF MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

     Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on
     toward the jacuzzi.  The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white.

     Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body.  Suzie, the contrast --
     pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans.  They
     argue -- we CANNOT HEAR.

     EXT. THE BAY - SAME

     Ray has arrived near the docks.  He has killed his engine,
     maneuvering here with a single oar.  He ties the skiff off behind
     the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest
     house and coming close to the pool.  He takes a position behind
     the cabanas, readies his camera.

     EXT. POOL AREA - SAME

     Kelly and Suzie continue their argument in front of the jacuzzi.

                                  KELLY
                  I can't believe you called Sam.  What's
                  the matter with you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared
                  there's no one to trust.

                                  KELLY
                  You can trust me.

     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the patio chair.  Kelly and Suzie are
     startled by it.  Kelly answers.

     INT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

     The bedside lamp is on.  Sam is on the phone.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly.  Is Suzie there?

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  Yes.

                                  SAM
                  Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left
                  this garbled message on my machine.
                         (beat)
                  Can you calm her down?

                                  KELLY (V.0.)
                  Why can't you come...

                                  SAM
                  No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm
                  counting on you.  You calm her down.
                  I mean do whatever you have to, whatever
                  it takes...

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  You know what it takes.

                                  SAM
                  Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly.
                  Do it tonight.  We'll figure something
                  out... Okay?

     EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT

     Kelly glances across the steamy water at Suzie.

                                  KELLY
                  Yeah, right.  Can you at least talk to
                  her, on the phone?

     NT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME

     Sam lies on his bed, waits for Suzie's voice on the line.

                                  SUZIE (V.O.)
                  Sam...

                                  SAM
                  Put Kelly on too.

     EXT. JACUZZI - SAME

     The girls stand cheek-to-cheek, the phone between them.

                                  KELLY
                  I'm here.

     INT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  I want you to hear this too.
                  We've got to be cool.  All of us.
                  People think I'm rich, for Christ's
                  sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.
                         (beat)
                  I'm spending my money.  It's more
                  suspicious if I sit around doing
                  nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck
                  with your minds.

     EXT. CABANAS - NIGHT

     Ray tapes the scene.

     The girls still hold the phone.

                                  SUZIE
                  But I..

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                  Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only
                  people who can blow this is us.
                  Remember?

                                  KELLY
                  Right.

     Suzie says nothing.  Kelly nudges her.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah, right.

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                  Good.  Just keep telling yourselves
                  that, the only people who can fuck this
                  up is us.

     The line goes dead.  Kelly hangs up.  Suzie stares into the
     jacuzzi.

                                  SUZIE
                  You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?

                                  KELLY
                  Oh, for Christ's sake.

                                  SUZIE
                  You are.

                                  KELLY
                  Are you retarded, or just brain dead
                  from whiffin' fumes out there in the
                  swamp...

     Suzie's face goes hard.

                                  SUZIE
                  That's what I am to you, isn't it?
                  Swamp trash.  It's what I am to
                  everybody, just like my mom...

     Kelly tries to put an arm around her.  Suzie slaps her -- a
     mistake -- Kelly's bigger, faster.  She slaps the side of Suzie's
     head, then grabs her legs, dumping her on the tile deck.

     ON RAY

     focusing the camera.

     Suzie tries to kick Kelly.

     Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage.

                                  KELLY
                  Stupid bitch.

     She very methodically grabs Suzie's hair, dragging her into the
     jacuzzi, holding her under the hot water.

     Suzie thrashes, breaks free, gags, arches out of the water, the
     wet T-shirt clinging to her small breasts.

     Kelly is on her again, slaps her, puts her hands to Suzie's
     throat -- violently sexual in her wet bikini.

     Kelly slams Suzie back onto the black-and-white tile, gets on top
     of her, knees between Suzie's legs, her hands on her throat.

     Suzie's skinny shape writhes underneath Kelly on the gleaming
     tile.  She gasps for air.  Kelly finally lets go, but remains on
     her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard.  A moment.  Kelly
     touches Suzie's face.

                                  KELLY
                  Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like
                  you want it or something.

     Suzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  God, you are scared, aren't you?

     Suzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her T-shirt
     up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  And this is going to make you feel
                  better, make you trust me...

     Suzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands
     onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to
     pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges...

     Suzie cries out in pain.  Kelly's hands move down to pull off
     Suzie's bottoms...

     ON RAY

     still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching.

     As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands
     slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves
     to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them...

                                                 CUT TO:

     VIDEOTAPE

     Kelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL --

     INT. POLICE ROOM - DAY

     Gloria, Ray, Hunter watch the tape.  Hunter's seen enough.  He
     slams the stop/tape.

                                  HUNTER
                  Are you crazy, Ray?

                                  RAY
                  You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was
                  Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the
                  girls...

                                  HUNTER
                  Ray.  The conversation on this tape is
                  totally unintelligible.
                         (beat)
                  What we have here, is you on the Van
                  Ryan property, without a proper warrant,
                  shooting a porn flick...

                                  RAY
                  I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A
                  month ago you were pulling these two
                  apart at the courthouse.
                         (beat)
                  They were acting.  They were all acting,
                  from the beginning.  And we bought it,
                  hook, line and sinker... And now they're
                  home free with six million of Sandra Van
                  Ryan's money.

                                  GLORIA
                  Which she might have saved, if she
                  hadn't set out to destroy the man's
                  life.

                                  RAY
                         (turning now on Gloria)
                  What?  You wouldn't go after some guy
                  you thought raped your daughter?
                         (beat)
                  Cone on.  She bought the same story we
                  did...

     Ray stops as Hunter brings the palm of his hand down on the table
     a loud SLAP.

                                  HUNTER
                  Listen, both of you.  You're not on a
                  case.  There is no fucking case.
                         (beat)
                  I've had it up to here with Sandra Van
                  Ryan.  Ray, you keep mucking around like
                  this and you are going to have her suing
                  us for invasion of privacy.  Get out of
                  these people's lives.
                         (beat)
                  Am I getting through on this?

     Ray walks to the door, jerks it open --

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer.

     Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes.

                                  HUNTER
                  Oh, Ray... no...

                                  RAY
                  You think this is just about money,
                  about us looking foolish?  Question him.
                  You're gonna find a stone cold
                  manipulative psychopath.  And those
                  girls are going to wind up dead...

     Sam lunges at Ray.  The officer and Hunter restrain him.  Gloria
     looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response.

                                  HUNTER
                  Mr. Lombardo, please.  I'm sorry about
                  this.

                                  SAM
                  Give this idiot something to do.  Let
                  him look into the Kennedy assassination.

     Ray flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they
     can be separated once again.

                                  SAM (CCNT'D)
                         (to Hunter)
                  Next time this guy drags me down here,
                  I'll sue you.  You're goddamn lucky I
                  didn't sue you the first time!

     Sam storms from the room, followed by Hunter.  Ray stares after
     them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself.

                                  RAY
                  Guess I kind of lost it there.

                                  GLORIA
                  You could say that.

                                  RAY
                  Were you ever in a situation where you
                  could see a thing coming and you didn't
                  do what you could to stop it?

     Gloria studies Ray, clearly concerned.

                                  GLORIA
                  We all have...

                                  RAY
                  I mean something bad, Gloria, something
                  bad you saw coning, and you didn't do
                  anything, and then it happened.
                         (off Gloria's silence)
                  I did that once.  I don't want to do it
                  again.

     EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

     Sam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath
     his arm.  He looks toward the parking lot where --

     Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.  She tips a valet
     then starts toward the mall.  She sees San.  Their eyes meet.  A
     moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.

                                  SAM
                  You look pretty.

                                  BARBARA
                  Thanks.

     Sam smiles.  She points to the stuff beneath his arm.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  Quite a shopping spree...

     She's kidding, then seems to consider how Sam might take it.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  I didn't mean...

     Sam laughs it off.

                                  SAM
                  Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend
                  it, right?  I've always wanted to live
                  where I could dive for my dinner.

                                  BARBARA
                  And where might that be?

                                  SAM
                  I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

                                  BARBARA
                  I love Antigua.
                         (beat)
                  Maybe I'll come visit you.

                                  SAM
                  I'd like that.

     A moment, she touches his face.  Sam raises a hand to cover hers,
     as...

     ... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above
     the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.

     INT. RANGE ROVER - KELLY VAN RYAN

     seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance.

     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

     Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand.  Barbara
     leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips.

     CLOSE ON KELLY

     lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of
     ENGINE NOISE.  She turns to find...

     Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her.

     Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in.  She's wearing a
     black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag.  As she settles in
     the seat, she lets out a long breath.

     Kelly makes a face, fans the air.

                                  KELLY
                  Jesus.  What are you drinking?

     Suzie laughs, pulls a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 from the bag.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                         (looking at the bottle)
                  Anybody ever tell you that stuff will
                  rot your brain?

                                  SUZIE
                  What brain?

     Suzie takes a big drink.  Kelly shakes her head, looks back
     toward the entrance.

     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

     empty.  Sam and Barbara are gone.

     Kelly continues to stare.

                                  SUZIE
                  What are you looking at?

                                  KELLY
                         (starting the car)
                  Nothing.

     EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

     The Atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the
     last red light drains from the sky.

     The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks.

     INT./EXT. RANGE ROVER - SAME

     Kelly turns off the engine.  Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the
     MD 20/20.  She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast.

                                  SUZIE
                  I thought we were goin' to a movie.

                                  KELLY
                  I think we just need to get wasted.

     Suzie shrugs, gets out.  Kelly gets out with her.  Suzie
     staggers.  Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around,
     begins leading her down the beach.

                                  SUZIE
                  I wanna live at the beach someday.

                                  KELLY
                  Shit.

     She stops walking.  Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to
     look at her.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  I left the keys.  I'll get 'em.

     Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.  She
     watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath
     her breath, then lies on her back.

     SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY

     The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.  She rolls to one side, looking down
     the beach

     Murky blackness.

     She tries to focus, sits up.

                                  SUZIE
                  Kelly?

     She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.

     A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Kelly?

     The shape gets closer and closer, until...

     Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.

     She takes a step back.

     Sam puts a hand on her shoulder.  He carries something in his
     other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.

                                  SAM
                  Suzie, it's okay.  It's me.

     Suzie steadies herself.  A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  I was worried about you, Suzie.  I
                  decided we should all get together, one
                  more time, before we split up.

                                  SUZIE
                  Are you mad at me?

                                  SAM
                  No, no.  Look, I probably should have
                  told you a little more, about the part I
                  intended to play.
                         (beat)
                  We'll go through it all again tonight.

     Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  This is a celebration Suzie, not a
                  suicide pact.

     He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  We'll chill out first, have a drink,
                  watch the stars.

     Suzie nods.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the
                  Jeep.  Could you get it for us?

     Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as...

     Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Let me tell you about this boat I picked
                  out for us...

     They move OUT OF SIGHT.  Kelly continues to walk, back along the
     sand toward the cars.

     INSERT - A SCREAM

     A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall
     silently on dark stone.

     Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep,
     where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the
     seats.  She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the
     beach.  As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS --
     it seems like forever

     Sam APP£ARS before her on the sand.  The champagne bottle swings
     loosely at the end of one arm.  it looks shiny now, dripping with
     Suzie's blood.

     Kelly goes to him.  She looks at the bottle, then throws herself
     against him -- a hard kiss.

                                  SAM
                  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to
                  happen like this.  She was losing it...

                                  KELLY
                         (breathless)
                  There was no way.  That cop would've
                  gotten her to tell him... everything.
                  She was weak and dumb...

     She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.  Sam takes
     a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry
     eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at
     which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he
     can into the black waves.

     EXT. RANGE ROVER ON THE SAUD - LATER

     Rear hatch open -- overhead light on.

     Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to
     the rear hatch.  As they heft her inside, the light catches --

     SUZIE'S FACE

     A mask of blood.

     Kelly turns away in disgust.  She goes to the passenger side
     door, gets in.

     Sam gets in behind the wheel.  For a moment the two of them just
     sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their
     own BREATHING.  Sam looks at Kelly.

     She is focused on the dark Atlantic.

                                  SAM
                  Are you okay?

     Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face.

                                  KELLY
                         (a long beat)
                  My mom would kill me if she knew I took
                  the Rover.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes.

     SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in
     waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.

     EXT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Almost empty of cars.  The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's VW,
     circles, comes back.  Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets
     into the VW and backs it out.

     EXT. BUS TERMINAL (MIAMI) - DAY

     Almost dawn.  A long parking lot fronts the terminal.  Suzie's VW
     arrives, parks, Sam gets out.  He goes to the waiting Range
     Rover, gets in and drives away.

     EXT. FRONT GATE - VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY

     A THIN STREAM OF MUDDY WATER

     flows beneath the gate, down the drive, toward the street.

     A HAND touches the water.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL the hand as that of Ray Duquette.

     EXT. VAN RYAN DRIVEWAY - SAME

     Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens,
     looking toward the house where...

     On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight
     shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover.  She looks up, sees...

     Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive,
     arriving at the wrought-iron gates.

                                  RAY
                  Been four-wheelin'?

     Kelly freezes -- not so cool this time.

                                  KELLY
                  Get off my property.

                                  RAY
                  I'm not on your property!

     He grabs the wrought-iron gate -- rattles it -- harder and
     harder.

     Kelly backs away, frightened.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     Gloria and Ray stand in front of the ramshackle wooden building,
     talking to Ruby.  Walter sits nearby, sharpening a knife.

                                  RAY
                  You say she didn't come back last night.

                                  RUBY
                  She's been sayin' she was going to go to
                  L.A.  But I don't know.  I mean all her
                  clothes are still here.  An' she's
                  missin' her graduation.
                         (a long beat)
                  She should graduate.  She's a smart
                  girl...

     Ray nods.  He makes a note in his pad.

                                  RAY
                  May have been she just partied too
                  much... But we'll look into it.  We find
                  something, you'll be the first to know.

     Ray turns and walks to the car.  Gloria follows.

     INT. CAR - SAME

     Ray sits for a moment behind the wheel.

                                  RAY
                  It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it
                  begins...

                                  GLORIA
                  Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She
                  could be anywhere...

     Ray silences her with a look.

                                  RAY
                  I'm gonna take you back to the office.
                  Will you put out a call on Suzie's car
                  for me?

                                  GLORIA
                  You have someplace to be?

     Ray starts the car, doesn't answer.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  If you want company...

                                  RAY
                  Just check out the car.

     Gloria nods.  She looks toward the camp store where the old lady
     can still be SEEN standing on the porch, beneath the jawbones.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Caps and gowns -- kids and parents on the lawn -- taking photos.

     Kelly poses with Sandra.  Tom Baxter aims the camera.

                                  BAXTER
                  Smile.

     Kelly and Sandra force miserable smiles.  CLICK.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  That's one for the scrapbook.

     Baxter moves away, greets Nicole and her parents.

     Kelly puts some room between her and Sandra.

                                  KELLY
                  You didn't have to fly back -- from --
                  wherever, for me...

                                  SANDRA
                  I'm here to congratulate my friends and
                  their children.  I'm leaving again
                  tonight.

                                  KELLY
                  Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.

                                  SANDRA
                  Where, the mall?

                                  KELLY
                  A friend of mine bought a boat.

     Sandra shakes her head, walks off.

     Kelly turns away, freezes, as she catches sight of --

     Ray talking with Jimmy.

     EXT. THE BEACH - DAY

     Ray and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the
     big rocks.  Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer T-shirt.  Ray
     wears a suit.  He carries the coat over his shoulder.

                                  JIMMY
                  It's those rocks, up there.

                                  RAY
                  You and Suzie used to come out here
                  together?

                                  JIMMY
                  Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang
                  out here.
                         (beat)
                  You really think something bad happened
                  to Suzie?

                                  RAY
                         (ignoring the question)
                  Lombardo ever come out here?

     Jimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that Ray is serious.  Still,
     the idea generates a laugh.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  I say something funny?

                                  JIMMY
                  No.  But I mean... just the idea that
                  Mr. Lombardo would...

                                  RAY
                  Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with
                  the kids, one of the guys...

                                  JIMMY
                  Yeah, but...

     He breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock.  Ray brushes
     away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking
     tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets.

     Jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees.

     CLOSE ON GLOVED HANDS

     as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone.

     Ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand.

     Jimmy stares at the teeth.

     Ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy.

                                  RAY
                  I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy.
                  You can catch a bus up there at the lot,
                  okay?

     Jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money.  He starts
     toward the lot.

     Ray watches for a moment.  Then calls out to him.

                                  RAY
                  People aren't always what they appear to
                  be, kid.  Remember it.

     Jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying,
     clearly disturbed by the implications.  But he asks no more
     questions.  He turns, trudging alone back through the sand.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. OCEAN COVE - LATER

     THE TEETH go into a plastic bag.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     Black-and-whites, county cars -- police tape across the site.

     Ray, Gloria and Hunter watch as DAVE MERRITT, a forensic expert
     bags the teeth.  He passes the bag to Ray, then bends to the
     rocks where he begins to take a blood sample.

                                  RAY
                  Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here.

     Hunter and Gloria exchange a look.

                  Two kids could've gotten into a fight,

                  Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.

                  The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a
                  swamp rat, knows the body will never be
                  found there.  But he's made a mistake.

     He holds up the evidence bag containing the teeth.

                                  GLORIA
                  Her grandmother said she'd been
                  threatening to run away.  And I found

                                  RAY
                  You don't think Sam could've put it
                  there?

                                  HUNTER
                  Dust it for prints.  My guess is, if
                  anybody murdered Suzie it was probably
                  that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan.

     Ray shakes his head; he turns to Dave, still working.

                                  RAY
                  How soon can we get something?

                                  DAVE
                  We can get blood type right away.
                  Dental records will take longer.  You
                  want DNA, that can take weeks.

     Ray nods, looks out to sea.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.

                                  GLORIA
                  We don't know that, Ray...

     Ray turns to her -- an intense look.

                                  RAY
                  Kelly's next, Gloria.

                                  HUNTER
                         (ice cold)
                  Get off this Ray, now.
                         (beat)
                  If there is any evidence here, it's for
                  Homicide.
                         (turning to Dave)
                  You get an ID, you call me.

     Dave nods.  Hunter stalks off toward his car.  Ray turns to
     Gloria.

                                  RAY
                  Will you do me one favor?

                  What do you do if you see a bad thing
                  coming?

     Gloria looks toward the highway, trying to decide.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need

                  If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a
                  promise.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - SUNSET

     Sam's Jeep -- a "FOR SALE" sign in the window -- sits in the lot.

     Across the road -- Gloria sits in the white Taurus.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, MAIN GATE - SUNSET

     Ray sits in his truck, picks up his cellular, punches in a
     number.

                  Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the

                                  RAY
                  What about the blood?

                         (a beat)
                  Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a

                                  RAY
                         (cutting him off)
                  Second you get something on those teeth,
                  I want it

     Ray hangs up without waiting for a reply.  He turns to the Van
     Ryan house, an orange light slanting across its facade.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     Gloria waits in her car.  She looks toward the motel.

     Sam's Jeep is parked before one of the bungalows.  There is a
     light on in the room.  We can SEE inside.

     Gloria sighs, picks up a pair of binoculars and trains them on
     the room.

     ANGLE ON ROOM - GLORIA'S POV

     Suitcases and boxes are stacked everywhere.  Sam, bare-chested,
     in khaki slacks, moves about the room.

     CLOSE ON GLORIA

     watching Sam, as...

     IN THE ROOM

     The PHONE has begun to RING.  Sam looks at it until it stops,
     then picks it up and dials a number.  Kelly answers.

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  Hello?

                  God, I've been calling you.

     INTERCUT - KELLY/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION

     Kelly is in the guest house, pacing in front of the gun case.

                                  KELLY
                  I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps
                  watching me.

                                  SAM
                  Duquette.  Forget him...

                                  KELLY
                  I can't help it.  He gives me the
                  creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared
                  of him?  She's not that way.  I think he
                  did something...

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, he got her busted for
                  possession...

                                  KELLY
                  I don't know... I think it was something
                  else... Suzie says the bust was
                  bullshit...

                                  SAM
                  And you believe her?

                                  KELLY
                         (a long beat -- a sigh)
                  I don't know.
                         (beat)
                  I want to see you...

                                  SAM
                  Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's
                  valium or something.  In another week
                  you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're
                  rich.

                                  KELLY
                  But what if they find out... God, they'd
                  put you in the gas chamber...

     Sam is about to respond, then looks out the window, sees...

     ACROSS THE STREET, the white Taurus.

                                  SAM
                  So if they're tapping your phone, we're
                  dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip
                  the graduation parties.  You'll never
                  see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.

                                  KELLY
                         (beat)
                  Okay.  I love you too.

     INT. TAURUS - SAME - GLORIA

     sees the light go out in Sam's room, lowers her binoculars, sits
     for a moment, then begins to write something on a pad.

     She's still at it when something KNOCKS at a FENDER.  She looks
     up, startled, to find...

     Sam in the street, still shirtless, his arms and shoulders
     back-lit by the neon light of the Glades Motel.

                                  SAM
                  Isn't that against the law, peeking into
                  windows?

                  Suzie Toller is missing.

     Sam lets out his breath, shakes his head.

                                  SAM
                  How long?

                                  GLORIA
                  She didn't cone home last night.  We
                  found her car at the bus terminal, but
                  nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.

                                  SAM
                  Maybe she used another name.

                                  GLORIA
                  Ray thinks she was murdered.

     Sam shakes his head once more.

                                  SAM
                  I don't know what to say...

                                  GLORIA
                  You could tell me where you were last
                  night.

     Sam stares at her.

                                  SAM
                  Goddannit... I don't have to...

     He stops himself, calms down.

                                  SAM
                  Come here.  I want you to see something.

     Gloria hesitates, looks up at Sam, then puts down the phone and
     opens her door.

     INT. GLADES MOTEL - SAME

     Sam and Gloria walk among the boxes and suitcases.

                                  GLORIA
                  Looks like goodbye.

     Sam nods.  He goes to one of his cardboard filing boxes, pulls
     out a file, hands it to Gloria.  As she takes it, he goes to the
     closet, takes a shirt from a hanger.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to
                  find an angry, sexually confused girl
                  who's made threats on her mother's life
                  and a female lover she'd never identify.

                                  GLORIA
                  Suzie?

     Sam shrugs.

                                  SAM
                  You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was
                  killed.  I don't have to ask you who he
                  thinks did it, do I?
                         (beat)
                  All I'm saying is, read that, you'll
                  have a new perspective on things.

     Gloria sits on the bed, the file in her hand.  She watches as Sam
     pulls on the shirt.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why didn't you tell us about this before
                  the trial?

     Sam holds her eyes.

                                  SAM
                  Then -- I still had ethical standards to
                  protect.  They meant a lot to me.  Now,
                  I don't care.  And no amount of money
                  can buy that back.

     Sam is interrupted by the HONKING of a HORN.  He looks outside.

     ANGLE ON LOT - SAM'S POV

     A taxi waits in the glow of the green neon.

     Sam looks down on Gloria, seated on his bed, her skirt short
     enough to REVEAL shapely legs.  For a moment the two hold one
     another's eyes.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  My ride.  If you're not planning on
                  arresting me, that is.

     INT. RAY'S TRUCK - NIGHT - LATER

     The PHONE RINGS.  Ray picks it up.

     INTERCUT - RAY/GLORIA PHONE CONVERSATION

     She's still in Sam's room, the file spread across the bed.

                  I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.

                  The blood type on the rocks matches
                  Suzie's.

                  It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do

                  there's more to this story than you
                  know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think
                  Hunter may be on the right track...

     Ray clicks off his phone.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, FRONT GATE - NIGHT

     Ray gets out of his car, presses the intercom.

     Ray CROSSES the deck, Sandra at his heels.

                                  RAY
                  Where is she?

                                  SANDRA
                  Where she lives.  In the guest house.
                  Now will you tell me what this is about?

                                  RAY
                  I'm placing your daughter under arrest.

                  Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want
                  Kelly to be next, then take my advice.
                  Stay out of my way.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - SAME

     A cap and gown lay strewn on the sofa.

     Kelly wears jeans and a bra.  She looks up to see Ray moving
     across the tile.  Her eyes go wide, then move to the gun case.

     EXT. GUEST HOUSE - SAME

     Sandra stands near the jacuzzi, not exactly sure what to do,
     watching as...

     ANGLE ON GUEST HOUSE - SANDRA'S POV

     Ray knocks at the French door.  It swings open.  He steps inside.

     A long moment, then VOI?ES, the SOUND of things being knocked
     about, BREAKING GLASS.

     Sandra starts toward the house then stops at the SOUND of a
     single GUNSHOT.

     A SECOND GUNSHOT follows, then a THIRD.

     The guest house door opens.  Ray stumbles out, his shoulder
     bloody, a .357 in his hand.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY'S STATEMENT

     We SEE him from the waist up -- a white T-shirt, his shoulder
     bandaged, his arm in a sling.  There are red scratch marks on his
     face.  His eyes look blankly into the camera.

                                  RAY
                  I fucked up.  I lost control of the
                  situation, the one thing they train you
                  for... God, what did I do?

                                  HUNTER (0.S.)

                  I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under

     Perfect crescent of sand.  A man in white shorts reclines in a
     beach chair, beneath a gaily-colored umbrella, sipping a drink.

                                  RAY
                  Kelly went crazy, started screaming.  I
                  grabbed her, put her on the floor.

     EXT. BEACH RESORT - CLOSER SHOT - DAY

     Sam, in white shorts, looking good, watches a beautiful island
     girl in a thong bikini frolic in the surf.

     She seems to sense Sam watching, turns toward the beach.  Her
     eyes meet Sam's.  She breaks into a beautiful smile.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY

                                  HUNTER (O.S.)
                  She bit you?

                                  RAY
                  Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned.
                  She calmed down.  I was going to cuff
                  her... She said she thought she was
                  going to be sick.  She asked to use the
                  bathroom.

     EXT. BEACH RESORT - DAY

     Sam and the island girl sit at an outdoor table.  The girl wears
     a short, terry cloth robe, Sam the white shorts and a flowered
     shirt.  They sip drinks.  Their eyes meet.  Their fingers touch.

                                  RAY
                  I told her I was coming with her.  She
                  nodded, like she understood.  We stood
                  up together.

                                  HUNTER (O.S.)
                  You didn't cuff her?

                                  RAY
                  She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought,
                  I would just go with her, stand at the
                  door...
                         (shaking his head)
                  I think I looked away.  A split second.
                  Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts
                  a knee into my groin.
                         (beat)
                  There was this coffee table between us
                  and the wall.  She got one foot on that
                  thing and launched herself at the gun
                  case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could
                  hear it breaking.
                         (beat)
                  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up,
                  just enough.  Before I could get to her,
                  she'd turned on me with this small
                  caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put
                  it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it
                  in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice.
                  I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think.
                  In the chest.

     INT. POLICE ROOM - SAME

     A moment of silence, save for the BUZZING of the MACHINE.  A
     number of plainclothes police, Hunter and Gloria among them,
     watch the tape.

                                   RAY
                  I went there to protect her...

     He hangs his head, then looks up, his eyes focusing.

                  Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only

     EXT. BOAT HARBOR (CARIBBEAN ISLAND) - DAY

     Brilliant sun on turquoise water.  A few boats anchored in a
     lagoon.  A quiet place.

     Heading out -- a forty-foot sloop, Sam at the helm.

     INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

     Gloria, Baxter, a tearful Sandra, sit in seats, watch as --

     Ray stands before a panel, A SUIT, A CHIEF in uniform, Hunter.

     Ray wears a suit, his hair neatly trimmed.  His arm is no longer
     in a sling, but one of his hands is still bandaged.

                                  CHIEF
                  Detective Duquette; our investigation
                  concludes that this was a good shooting.
                  But that's irrelevant.  You were not
                  assigned to this case -- whatever you
                  imagined this case to be.  And now two
                  young women are dead.  You are
                  terminated with forfeiture of pension
                  and benefits.

     Ray looks at the floor.

     Hunter coughs.  His hands rest on a file -- we SEE the video
     cassette inside -- labeled "TOLLER/VAN RYAN -- CONFIDENTIAL."

                                  HUNTER
                  Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were
                  found near the area known as Stoner
                  Rocks.  Suzie's blood was found in the
                  Van Ryan Range Rover.  This, in
                  conjunction with evidence obtained by
                  Detectives Duquette and Perez has led
                  this office to the conclusion that Susan
                  Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly
                  Lanier Van Ryan...

     Sandra chokes back a sob.  She gets to her feet, to be led from
     the room by Tom Baxter.

     Gloria Perez watches, a sad look in her eye, then turns to look
     at Ray.  His back is to her -- the broad shoulders, expensive
     suit.  His hands are clasped behind his back.

     EXT. BLUE BAY CEMETERY - KELLY'S FUNERAL - DAY

     Gloria stands among a considerable number of mourners.  She is
     just back from Sandra and Tom Baxter, who, in turn, are just back
     from the open grave.

     As Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something
     catches her eye.  Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze.

     ANGLE ON CEMETERY - GLORIA'S POV

     On a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people
     stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter.

     When Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman
     has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people
     on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he
     might make them disappear.

     Gloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open
     grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan
     family plot and, in fact, the entire scene.

     ANGLE CN MARKER

     The angel Gabriel, trumpet in hand, carved in relief upon a huge
     obelisk of black marble.  Beneath the angel is a carved scroll
     and upon it the words:

     "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE," and below that:  "WILLIAM
     TECUMSEH VAN RYAN.  MAY HE REST IN PEACE."

     EXT. A BEACH - NIGHT

     Sam Lombardo walks along a moonlit lagoon, headed toward a lone
     bungalow.

     The bungalow is simple, picturesque -- whitewashed walls, a
     thatched roof.  A patio opens onto the beach.

     EXT. PATIO - SAME

     As Sam steps in off the sand, he sees something and stops short.

     Wet spots lead toward the bungalow.

     Sam listens.  Everything is quiet.

     INT. BUNGALOW - SAME

     Sam ENTERS in a room lit only by the blue light of a large
     aquarium.  He listens once more, hears it -- RUNNING WATER.

     He moves down a short hallway, observes the light which spills
     from beneath a bedroom door.  He pushes it open, goes inside.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     He CROSSES the room.

     The bathroom door is ajar, the room leaking steam.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Sam steps inside, looks at the shower stall -- an indistinct
     shape moves there in the steam.

     San watches, then jerks open the shower door.  The steam
     clears -- REVEALING a tall, athletic body, and now the face --

     Ray Duquette, grinning at Sam out of the swirling steam.

                                  RAY
                  Buy you a drink?

     San takes a step back.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus.  I wasn't expecting you 'til
                  tomorrow.

     Ray turns off the water, steps out of the stall, wrapping himself
     in a towel.  There's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and
     Ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist.  He
     looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar.

                                  RAY
                  Nice girlfriend you had there.

     Sam just looks at him.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, well, you fixed that.
                         (beat)
                  What the hell happened, anyway?

                                  RAY
                  The bitch shot me, is what happened.

     Sam shakes his head, walks back into the bedroom.  Ray follows.

                                  RAY (CCNT'D)
                  Hey, what did you want me to do, die?

                                  SAM
                  Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't
                  teach you to disarm people, shoot them
                  in the leg or something?  You weren't
                  supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.

     Now Ray just looks at Sam, his eyes narrowing.

                                  RAY
                  Did you become squeamish about these
                  things before or after you bludgeoned
                  little Suzie Toller to death with a wine
                  bottle?
                         (off Sam's silence)
                  Jesus, man.
                  It couldn't have worked out better.
                  They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie.
                  I can't talk 'em out of it.
                         (beat)
                  We should be celebrating.  This thing
                  worked out just like you said, only
                  better.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly was supposed to be framed, not
                  killed.
                         (beat)
                  What I'm telling you is, I don't like
                  surprises.

     Ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a
     bucket of ice.  He opens the bottle, fills two glasses.  He hands
     one of the glasses to Sam.

                                  RAY
                  Every cloud has a silver lining,
                  partner.  Here's to no loose ends.

     He raises his glass in a toast.

     Sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well.  Ray smiles.  Sam
     doesn't.

                                  SAM
                  Here's to no more surprises.

     Ray shrugs.  The two men's eyes meet.  They touch glasses and
     drink.

     EXT. SMALL BOAT HARBOR (ISLAND) - DAY

     Sam and Ray work on the deck of Sam's sloop, stowing gear,
     loading supplies.

     The boat's mast shines in the sunlight before a brilliant sky.
     Palms sway.  The men work in silence.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     Gloria drives up in the white Taurus.  She parks before the
     ramshackle old building and the gator pen.

     Walter is in the pen.  Ruby stands just outside of it.  She looks
     toward the road as Gloria gets out, then back to the pen.

     Gloria comes down the bank to stand beside Ruby.  She's just in
     time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its
     front legs, jaws sprung wide.  The women watch as Walter sticks
     his arm into the gator's mouth.

                                  RUBY
                  Gator can't see what's in front of it
                  for shit.  They see out the sides.
                         (beat)
                  That one don't even know Walter's arm's
                  in his mouth.

                                  GLORIA
                  What if something distracts it and it
                  snaps anyway?

                                  RUBY
                  Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of
                  his goodbye.
                         (loud enough for Walter
                          to hear)
                  He don't use it for no good deeds
                  anyway.

     Walter looks at the ladies, picks up the stick and sweeps it
     between the gaping jaws, which snap in its wake.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  You come all the way out here to watch
                  Walter?

                                  GLORIA
                  I was wondering if I could ask you a few
                  questions.

                                  RUBY
                  About Suzie?

                                  GLORIA
                  Actually, I was wondering if I might ask
                  you about Ray Duquette.

                                  RUBY
                         (a long beat)
                  He used to come around here.  He had a
                  thing going with one of the girls over
                  at the Glades.

     Ruby nods toward the motel, a bitter smile on her face.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  Got sort of hung up on her, from what
                  hear.

                                  GLORIA
                  She still work there?

                                  RUBY
                  No.  Not after that night.
                         (a long beat)
                  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he
                  caught her with some john...
                  All I know is, the next morning the girl
                  was gone and there was a dead boy...
                  Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live
                  down the road there in a wrecked car.
                  Him and Suzie were at the Glades that
                  night.
                         (beat)
                  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie
                  busted and sent her away.  That's what
                  there is to say about Ray Duquette.

                                  GLORIA
                  Was there ever any kind of
                  investigation...

     Ruby cuts her off with a short laugh.

                                  RUBY
                  Duquette always claimed the kid was
                  dusted, came after him with a knife.
                  But it was Jack's Fish Camp... This
                  could be the moon for all most people
                  care.
                         (a long beat)
                  Wasn't supposed to be like that though.
                  This place was supposed to be something
                  once.  There were going to be roads and
                  houses.  There was going to be a town.
                  They were going to call it Salt Creek.

     EXT. OCEAN - DAY

     From the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the
     distance.  The bow of the sloop comes INTO FRAME.

     On board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm.  Ray lounges
     on the deck.  The boat sails easily before the wind.

                                  SAM
                  Ray... you see that winch by your head?
                  Take a couple of turns on it for me,
                  she's luffing.

     Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch.

                                  RAY
                  You mean this thing?

                                  SAM
                  Yes, we call it a winch.
                         (pointing at pieces of
                          the rigging)
                  And these are shrouds, and these are
                  stays.

                                  RAY
                  I thought this was supposed to be a
                  vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big
                  power boat?

                                  SAM
                  Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of
                  you yet.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, or get me drowned.

     Ray kneels.  He begins to tighten the winch.

     Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back
     to unhook the short line which holds the boom.

     The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc,
     directly at Ray.

     Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm.

     The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines,
     where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords.

     Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the
     deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board.

     The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a
     small ground swell.

     The two men face each other.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus, man... You okay?

                                  RAY
                  That how you planned it?  You take cut
                  Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then
                  dump me in the ocean...

                                  SAM
                  Come off it, man... It was an accident.

     Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and
     starts with it toward Sam.

     Sam looks around.  He jerks open a storage compartment.  A
     diver's weight belt tumbles out.  Sam grabs it, swings it over
     his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum,
     preparing to throw.

     Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle.  The boom
     sweeps the deck.

     Sam throws the belt.

     Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself,
     a mean grin spreading across his face.

     There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else.

     Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall,
     well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.

     Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit.  Ray jumps in.  But that's
     as far as he gets.

     WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.  He screams, goes down,
     the handle skittering across the deck.

     Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he
     sees something else.  He draws in his hand as if bitten.

                                  RAY
                  You... You're...

     He scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at
     his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed.
     But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  You're dead... for godsake...

     The boat heels over.  The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the
     edge of the cockpit.  He grimaces in pain as...

     Suzie Toller steps up from belowdecks.  She's wearing a bikini
     and showing a nice tan.  She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a
     fresh spear at the ready.

                                  SUZIE
                  Rumors of my demise have been greatly
                  exaggerated.
                         (to Sam)
                  Nice move.  Good thing I was here to
                  save your incompetent ass.

     Sam secures the boom.  Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with
     some combination of pain, rage and fear.

                                  RAY
                  You... I should've killed you myself.
                  should never have left it up to him...

                                  SUZIE
                  Shoulda, coulda, woulda...
                         (to Sam)
                  Get him in the water.

     San starts for Ray.

                                  RAY
                  Sam, for Christ's sake...

     Sam's feet slide in the bloody smear.  He stops.

     Ray clings to a safety line.

                                  SAM
                  I can't.

     WHOOSH -- A second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder.  He loses his
     grip.  The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water.

     Suzie puts down her spear gun.  She goes to a storage locker,
     takes out a bait bucket.  She steps up on the deck.

     Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around
     him.  He calls out...

                                  RAY
                  Sam, for godsake.

                                  SUZIE
                  Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the
                  numbered bank account besides yours and
                  Sam's?

     She raises the bucket, heaves bloody chum into the water.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I like these joint survivorship
                  accounts.  Something unfortunate happens
                  to one of the signatories, the others
                  don't have to worry.  Are you worrying,
                  Ray?

     She heaves more chum -- a big red slurp across Ray's face.

     Ray gasps, goes under, thrashing around in the red slick.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em.

     INSERT - SHARKS

     from underwater, in a frenzy, rip a human body into a bloody
     cloud.

     EXT. SAILBOAT - LATER

     Suzie cones up from below with a champagne bottle and glasses,
     already filled.

                                  SUZIE
                  Feeling better?

     Sam gazes out to sea.

                                  SAM
                  That was about as grim as it gets.

                                  SUZIE
                  The guy was history when he killed
                  Kelly.  You knew that.

                                  SAM
                  But then you knew what he was like all
                  along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a
                  thing you had counted on...

                                  SUZIE
                  But then it is better this way, don't
                  you think?  No loose ends.

     Sam just looks at her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  What?

                                  SAM
                  That was the same thing Ray said.

     Suzie smiles -- showing the big gap where her two front teeth
     used to be.

                                  SUZIE
                  Poor Ray.
                         (a beat)
                  Come on Sam, we did it.  We put the
                  screws to the Van Ryans.  We won.

     She hands a glass to Sam, takes the other.  He puts it to his
     lips, suddenly hesitates, thinks, sniffs the glass.

     A moment.  Suzie shakes her head.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Talk about paranoid.  Now are you gonna
                  teach me to sail this big old boat or
                  not?

     Sam downs his drink.

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  Grab that winch there.

     Suzie gives him a pouty look.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  What's wrong?

                                  SUZIE
                  Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.

     Sam sighs.

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  Come here and take the helm.
                  I'll get the winch.

     Suzie gives him her best, gap-toothed smile, then comes forward
     to take the gleaming chrome wheel, as Sam scrambles up on deck,
     kneeling where Ray had kneeled before him to set the jib.

     Suzie watches -- a long beat, then, slowly reaches behind her,
     unhooking the line which holds the boom...

     ANGLE ON BOOM

     sweeping the deck -- coming right at us, blotting out the sky.

     EXT. SMILING JACK'S - SUZIE'S ROOM - DAY

     Gloria sits on Suzie's bed, books spread out around her.  Ruby
     stands beside her.

                                  RUBY
                  You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt
                  Creek land deal?  Girl read every book
                  she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.

     Ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a
     photograph on the bed.  It is one we have seen before.

     ANGLE ON PHOTO

     A stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit.  White hair, a
     white handlebar mustache.  A derby on his knee, a walking stick
     at his side.  He stares out at the world from a high-backed
     wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers.

     Across the bottom of the picture is the name -- "WILLIAM TECUMSEH
     VAN RYAN."  And beside that, in another hand -- "Dear old Dad."

                                  RUBY
                  Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy
                  the people who invested here.  He got to
                  be old, he and his rich cronies would
                  come down here, hunt and whore, act like
                  assholes.  One trip he showed up with
                  this young girl he'd picked up
                  somewhere, gotten her pregnant then
                  dumped her in the swamp.
                         (indicating the photo)
                  That came with her.

                  And the child...

                                  RUBY
                  She had it, before she drank herself to
                  death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...

                  Then you're not her grandmother...

                                  RUBY
                  Raised her like she was, but no,
                  Walter's my only child.
                         (beat)
                  He was a good boy, till the army took
                  him.

     Gloria looks once more at the old photograph.

                                  GLORIA
                  So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half-
                  sisters.

                                  RUBY
                  And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's
                  niece.

     Gloria stands, a little weary.  Ruby walks her from the room.

                                  GLORIA
                  Thank you for talking to me, Ruby.  I am
                  sorry about Suzie, she...

     They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short,
     noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white
     TV has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television.

                                  RUBY
                  You okay?

                                  GLORIA
                  I'm fine.  Nice TV.

     The old lady nods, walks her outside.

     The dusty road, the little dock, the gator pen.

                                  RUBY
                  There's an old saying from the
                  Everglades -- virtue may be missed but
                  sin can't hide.
                         (a long beat)
                  Folks pay in the end.

     Gloria nods.  She is distracted by a movement in the gator pen.

     CLOSE ON PEN

     For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the
     surface of the pond which lies inside the pen, then, slowly, the
     GATOR'S EYES -- cold, reptilian, unblinking, rising up to gaze
     across the oily waters.

     Kelly is frantically trying to unlock the gun case as Ray comes
     through the French doors.  She can't get it done.  He's there in
     an instant.

     She screams, backs away, then watches as Ray stops, wraps a hanky
     around his hand and breaks the glass.

     He takes out a small caliber handgun, checks the clip, aims the
     gun at his own shoulder and fires.

                  You've got the pressure too tight.
                  You'll crush the fucking evidence.

     Sam takes a breath, prepares to try again.  Suzie pops a couple
     of pills with gulps of wine.  Sam goes to it once more.

                  We gotta stop.  I'm gonna come.

     Kelly laughs, straddles him.

                                  KELLY
                  That never seemed to worry you at the

                  I love you.  Now give me the line.

                         (a whiny voice)

     Ray Duquette EXITS a bungalow, a sport coat over his arm.  He
     heads for Jim's Recovery Room.  In another moment, a young hooker
     in a leather miniskirt walks out of the same bungalow.

                                  SUZIE
                  Seems to like some of the same places
                  you do.  Funny you never met.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about
                  this, I could get busted on the spot.

                                  SUZIE
                  Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like

                  I've seen you out there in your old air
                  boat, thinking about what might have
                  been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you

                  anything you haven't done already.

     skimpy cutoffs and cowboy boots -- long legs flashing as she
     nears Sam's booth.  Sam looks up, as...

          INT. MUSEUM - DAY
          
          A perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS,
          glinting in the morning sun.
          
          Tounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass
          covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble MUSEUM HALL.
          
          The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the
          breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them. MARIE
          CLIFFORD's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the
          cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds...
          
          She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. Not to touch
          the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted
          in the case below the priceless jewels. It's of a MOTHER cradling
          her BABY DAUGHTER...

          Marie spins round, sees the bespectacled CURATOR, 60's, standing
          behind her.
          
                              MARIE
                    Just leaving.
          
          Marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case...

          EXT. MUSEUM - DAY
          
          Marie fires up her powerful BMW, parked right outside the austere
          Museum building. The powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds

           Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing
          and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip
          three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club.

          She SLAMS on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car.
          Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing
          arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt.
          
          She sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her
          windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from
          the front bumper of the BMW.
          
          The sudden jolt has changed the radio station. A newscaster

                    again failed to snare its subject.
          
          ELENA SANDOVAL, 17, stands defiantly in front of the BMW, her

                    eighteen and thirty, remains at large...
          
          Marie reaches out with a trembling hand, turns off the stereo,
          then leans out of the car window.
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm... so... sorry...
          
          Elena smiles wryly.
          
                              ELENA
                    You will be.
          
          And she means it...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   3.
          
          
          
          INT. BLUE BAY HIGH AUDITORIUM - MORNING
          
          The auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body. The
          natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat
          headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back.
          
          Marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still
          shocked by what happened out in the parking lot...
          
                              JENNY
                        (handing over a present)
                    Happy birthday, babe. They ain't
                    diamonds, but you're just gonna have to
                    wait for those...
          
          Marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of OPAL EARRINGS.
          
                              MARIE
                        (unconvincing)
                    Thank you. Thank you so much...
          
                              JENNY
                    Are you OK, hon?
          
          Marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the
          freaks and geeks crowd round Elena, worshipping her like the
          Goddess she is...
          
                              MARIE
                    I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's
                    just...that new girl...I almost hit her
                    in the parking lot...
          
                              JENNY
                    You mean the towel girl, the one who
                    transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You
                    know the only reason she's slinging
                    towels is 'cos it's court ordered...
          
          Marie and Elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea
          of hormonally challenged students as Principal LIONEL MOSSTER, his
          ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained, steps onstage.
          
                              MOSSTER
                    We're here today to address a growing
                    epidemic that affects all of you.
          
          He pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down...
          
                              MOSSTER
                    National studies report sexual activity
                    among students at an all-time high.
          
                                                          03/22/2004   4.
          
          
          
          The students all cheer, naturally.
          
                              MOSSTER
                    We'll see who's cheering when you've got
                    an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or
                    get slapped with a paternity suit...Or
                    arrested for date rape. But don't take my
                    word for it...
          
          He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural
          beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and
          glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome...
          
                              PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
                    Miss Richards and Dr. Borman are here to
                    tell you about the pitfalls first hand...
          
          Kristen steps up to the lectern.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Good morning, my name is Kristen
                    Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami
                    juvenile parole board, as some of you
                    already know...
          
          Quick glance at Elena who rolls her eyes...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    But that's not what brings me here today.
                    When I heard about Principal Mosster's
                    sex education program I thought I'd
                    volunteer my own personal story, in hopes
                    that you might learn from the mistakes I
                    made. Back in High school all I wanted to
                    do was get drunk, stoned and laid...
          
          The students roar their approval.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    By my junior year, my life was a blur of
                    cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every
                    night of the week...
          
          Elena covers her mouth, as if to cough...
          
                              ELENA
                        (through fake coughs)
                    ...whore...
          
          Kristen ignores the slur.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   5.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And then, one night at some pathetic frat
                    party, someone slipped a roofie in my
                    drink...and raped me.
          
          This quiets the auditorium.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't
                    crawl when I think of the violation and
                    humiliation I endured. I can promise you
                    that if you make the same kind of wrong-
                    headed choices I did, you'll be seeing
                    Dr. Borman...
          
          Chad steps to the podium.
          
                              CHAD
                    Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr.
                    Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at
                    the police department, where my work has
                    helped convict hundreds of sex offenders.
                    Most teens like Ms. Richards never get
                    their lives together. The physical scars
                    may go away, but the emotional damage
                    stays forever.
          
          While Chad drones on, MUDDY, a Gremlin-eyed drooler, sitting in
          front of Elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up
          on the back of the chair. He spots the ugly plastic bracelet
          locked around one of her ankles.
          
                              MUDDY
                    That's not...what I think it is, is it?
          
                              ELENA
                    Whattchya think it is, bitch?
          
          The words catch in his throat.
          
                              MUDDY
                    One of them...Parole leashes...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bingo.
          
                              MUDDY
                    So you can't, like, go more than ten
                    miles from the cop shop?
          
          Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.
          
                                                             03/22/2004   6.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Five. I got someone's panties in a bunch.
          
          Back at the podium, Chad leans forward, making sure his words
          resonate with the student body.
          
                              CHAD
                    And as for the perpetrators of this
                    heinous act, even if you are still a
                    minor, you will be tried as an adult,
                    and, if convicted, you will do hard time.
          
          He pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students.
          
                              CHAD
                    Are there any questions?
          
                              ELENA
                        (calling out)
                    Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards.
          
                                KRISTEN
                    Ask away.
          
                              ELENA
                    When they found the scumbag who took your
                    precious flower of virginity, you sued
                    his sorry ass, right?
          
          Kristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her
          words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Uh, no, actually, I was never able to
                    make a positive ID. All I remember was
                    his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in
                    my ear, "You won't remember, but you'll
                    never forget..."
          
          Elena cracks a sideways grin...
          
                              ELENA
                    So what you're really saying is you
                    fucked for free...
          
          Kristen has no answer to that. Principal Mosster does his best to
          control the situation...
          
                              PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
                    Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young
                    lady!
          
          Like Elena cares.   She leans back, nods. Job done.
          
                                                                        7.
          
          
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH DIVING POOL - DAY
          
          The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the
          side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full
          swing...
          
                              ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Blue Bay High School would like to
                    welcome all participating diving teams
                    from the tri-county region...
          
          Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their
          school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area.
          
          But all eyes are on the home team. Masturbatory fantasies abound
          as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches...
          
          And as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to
          absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white
          bathing suit.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    First up, district champion Marie
                    Clifford...
          
          The crowd cheers, watching Marie edge out to the diving platform
          twenty feet above. Jenny right behind, waits on the ladder...
          
          JAY CLIFFORD, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late
          thirties, focuses a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA on Marie from the front
          row of the bleachers...
          
                              JAY
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          Marie just rolls her eyes.
          
                              JENNY
                    Your stepfather's just got a lot invested
                    in the team.
          
          Marie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices
          the incongruous figure of Elena, sidling up to him...
          
                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    Just try to keep those legs together.
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen
                    Virgin.
          
          
          
                                                           03/22/2004   8.
          
          
          
          Jay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with
          the world's hottest towel girl...
          
                                 JAY
                    Excuse me?
          
                              ELENA
                    You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in
                    Clifford construction?
          
                              JAY
                    I am, yes, but...
          
                              ELENA
                    I'd love to see one of your erections...
          
          Whoa. Jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the
          platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into
          the air.
          
          It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double
          back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form. She quickly
          resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with
          her teammates before crossing to Jay.
          
                               JAY
                    Nice take off, gotta work on the
                    landing...
          
                              MARIE
                    I can't do any better...
          
          Jay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately.
          
                              JAY
                    No such word as 'can't. Now do it again.
                    Only better...
          
          Marie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. As
          she's about to start the arduous climb, Elena hands her a towel...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bet you choke.
          
          Stops Marie in her tracks.
          
                              MARIE
                    What's your major malfunction?
          
                              ELENA
                    Just wanted to make a wager. Between best
                    friends.
          
                                                                        9.
          
          
          
          Marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform.
          
                              ELENA
                    You blow this dive, I get those diamonds
                    of yours.
          
          Marie stops, looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the
          ladder, shakes her head...
          
                              MARIE
                    How'd you know about my inheritance?
          
                              ELENA
                    Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's
                    the day, right?
          
                              MARIE
                    And what, pray tell, are you willing to
                    wager when I win?
          
          Elena thinks for a second, glances back at Jay with a big smile.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll stay away from your stepfather. You
                    make it, I won't be your new stepmom
                    anytime soon. Whattya say?
          
          Marie just stands there incredulous for a moment.
          
                              MARIE
                    Take your sorry ass back to the swamps.
          
          She ascends the ladder, leaving Elena behind...
          
                              ELENA
                    Choke!
          
          Marie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on
          the task at hand. But can't help but notice her nemesis below,
          walking slowly, seductively, up to Jay, intoxicating him...
          
          Marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at
          hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop
          looming beyond...
          
          She slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. It's an odd
          design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond...
          
          She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting
          in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split
          second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   10.
          
          
          
          She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking
          beauty. Thank God this is in slow motion.
          
          And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks,
          does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible
          instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.
          
          Marie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE. Treading water, she can't help
          but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers...
          
          EXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON
          
          Sickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the
          inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion...
          
          Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the
          grounds. Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non-
          alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch
          of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland...
          
          Marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs
          and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.
                               J
                               ENNY
                    What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that
                    one judge only gave you a 9.7?
          
          Marie forces a smile.
          
                              MARIE
                    Nah. I'm cool.
          
                              JENNY
                    Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe.
                    You got diamonds on the mind.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    Have either of you seen my video camera?
          
          Marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a
          bemused look to Jay's face.
          
                              JAY
                    I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure...
          
          He shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against
          it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers...
          
                              JAY
                    Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass
                    to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday.
          
          Everyone raises their fine crystal.
          
          H
          
          
          
          
                                                           03/22/2004   11.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    She's become every inch of the woman her
                    Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is
                    now, Julie's looking down and smiling.
          
          Tears well in Marie's eyes...
          
                              JAY
                    And that's why, on your eighteenth
                    birthday, Marie, I know your mother
                    wanted you to have...
          
          He notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well-dressed MEN
          standing at the entrance to his house. Whoever they are, Jay's
          instantly unnerved. He stumbles over his words...
          
                              JAY
                    ... she wanted you to have... a wonderful
                    birthday party surrounded by all your
                    friends.
          
           e glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter...
          
                              JAY
                    Please excuse me.
          
          ... and hurries after them.   Marie is left dumbfounded. So close,
          but so far...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay! What about my present?
          
          She chases after him...
          
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the
          opulent Clifford Mansion, past framed family photos, of Jay, Marie
          and the late Julie...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay?
          H
           e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in
          the kitchen. She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne, pops the
          cork. Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    It simply can't be done...
          
          Marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway,
          and down towards Jay's study...
          
                                                                       12.
          
          
          
                              JAY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    In all construction there's delays.
          
          Marie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack. What she
          sees makes the blood run cold in her veins...
          
          An imposing Cuban businessman, MR. BARAJAS, stands threateningly
          over a visibly frightened Jay. Another man, CICATRIZ, dressed in
          designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn
          of this little operation.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    Four months is not a delay. It's a
                    disaster.
          
                              JAY
                    You have my word, Mr. Barajas, the
                    building is almost finished. Just give me
                    a week, two tops.
          
          Barajas nods to Cicatriz, who moves in on Jay with lightning
          quickness, holds a Razor sharp KNIFE against his thumb.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    We are long past the negotiation stage.
          
          Cicatriz runs the steel blade across Jay's thumb. Marie has to
          cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood
          stain the spotless white carpet.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS (CONT'D)
                    For every day the building goes
                    unfinished, we'll take a finger...
          
          A sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips.
          
                              CICATRIZ
                    Pray, Mr. Clifford, you finish before the
                    eleventh day...
          
          And with that the Cuban men head to the door. Marie scrambles
          away, her heart pounding...
          
          She's halfway down the hallway when Mr. Barajas and Cicatriz exit
          Jay's study. She turns, tries to look innocent as the Cuban
          'businessmen' stare her down.
          J
           ay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow.
          
                              JAY
                    Marie! Shouldn't you be with your
                    friends?
          
          A
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   13.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    I was just...
          
          Cicatriz takes a step towards her.
          
                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    I'll be right there. With your gift...
                    just... wait outside, OK?
          
          Marie backs away, never taking her eyes off the intimidating Cuban
          men...
          
          EXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi-clad partygoers, in a
          daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne.
          
          Jenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost
          sheep with open arms.
          
                              JENNY
                    So? Did you get the key? Are you Blue
                    Bay's richest bitch?
          
          Marie's thoughts are drowned out by the ROAR of a powerful engine.
          All attention turns to a rusted MOTORCYCLE as it streaks across
          the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of MUD in its wake.
          
           nd atop the bike... Elena, in skintight leathers.
          
                              JENNY
                    Holy shit, who invited her?
          
          Marie's slightly drunken eyes narrow. Elena brings the bike to a
          screeching halt inches from the surprised guests. The ultimate
          partycrasher...
          
                              MARIE
                    This is a private party...
          
                              ELENA
                    Don't mind me. I ain't here for your
                    stupid party.
          
          She's striding towards the Mansion, towards Jay who's standing at
          the patio doors, an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands.
          
                              MARIE
                    Get the hell outta here! NOW!
          
          Marie stumbles after Elena, grabbing her from behind, holding her
          back. There's a tense moment before...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   14.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Damn girl, whattcha been drinking?
          
                              MARIE
                    Stay away from my stepfather!
          
                                 ELENA
                    Make me...
          
          And that's it. Marie lashes out with a haymaker punch. Connects on
          Elena's jaw and she goes reeling back. But it's ignited the street
          fighter in her, and she comes roaring back into the fray, ramming
          into Marie and together they tumble to the ground...
          T
           he crowds gather to watch the cat-fight, in equal parts appalled
          and aroused. It's a hair pulling, teeth gnashing, make up smearing
          wrestling match, no holds barred. The drunken Marie has the upper
          hand, the alcohol fueling her rage.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    What the hell's going on here?
          
          And that stops the fight right there and then. Marie looks up to
          see a red faced Jay standing over her.
          
                              MARIE
                    This...trash is just looking for a meal
                    ticket...
          
          Elena gets to her feet, licks the blood from her split lip.
          
                              ELENA
                    Mr. Clifford. Betcha proud of little
                    Marie now, huh?
          
          He hauls Marie to her feet, thrusts her towards the mansion.
          
                              JAY
                    Party's over.
          
          Groans from the crowd, but Jay's mind is made up.
          
                              MARIE
                    But...what about...my present...
          
          Jay's already walking away.
          
                              JAY
                    I'm going to the condos. Sleep it off,
                    whydontcha?
          
          Elena watches Jay stride away, like a lioness stalking her prey...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   15.
          
          
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING SITE - NIGHT
          
          Work lights illuminate the half finished condo building site, on
          prime beachfront real estate. These places would sell for
          millions, if they were ever finished...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          In a concrete makeshift office, on the top floor of the condo
          building, Jay clicks open the lock on his large metal safe and the
          steel door swings open.
          
          Inside are stacks of CASH, piled high, along with a shiny new
          HANDGUN. Jay flicks through the money, shaking his head...
          
                              JAY
                        (sotto)
                    Not enough. Just not enough...
          
          A clanking noise from outside has him quickly snatching the gun
          from the safe, before closing it once more, spinning the lock...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
          
          Jay walks out of his office, into the half-finished top floor of
          the condos. Exposed beams and drying cement reveal how far behind
          schedule Jay really is...
                               J
                               AY
                    Hello? Anyone there?
          
          He swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the
          flickering florescent light...
          
          Finally Jay lowers the weapon. It looks like he might collapse,
          until he catches himself, palms flat against the wall, head down.
          
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                    Fuck me...
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    Any time. Any place...
          
          He reels around, sees Elena moving toward him, brushing aside the
          thick plastic sheeting. She has a bottle of beer in one hand, a
          video camera in the other. Jay's video camera to be precise...
          
                              JAY
                    What are you doing here?
          
                              ELENA
                    You promised to show me your erection...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   16.
          
          
          
          Elena focuses the video camera on Jay's crotch. Makes him
          incredibly uncomfortable, obviously.
          
                              JAY
                    Is that my...camera?
          
          Elena thrusts the bottle of beer at Jay.
          
                              ELENA
                    Lighten up, Jay.
          
          Jay takes the bottle from her, sets it down on the concrete floor.
          
                              JAY
                    Enough's enough. I think it's time you
                    left.
          
          This brings a teasing pout to Elena's lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    Is that any way to treat Marie's new best
                    friend?
          
          Jay's taken aback.
          
                              JAY
                    You're best friends are you?
          
                              ELENA
                    Sure. We've been having sleepovers.
                    Talking about boys, swapping tips. She's
                    been teaching me about shopping, I've
                    been teaching her about giving mind
                    blowing head...
          
          Jay's taken aback once more. How much more aback can he be taken?
          He reaches out and blocks the video camera lens.
          
                              JAY
                    Gimme the camera back...
          
          Elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him. Keeps the
          camera trained on his worried face...
          
                              ELENA
                    Come get it.
          
          Jay's reaching his elastic limit. He reaches for the camera, but
          Elena won't let go. They wrestle for control of the video camera.
          And finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across
          the room and SHATTERS on the concrete floor...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   17.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                        (slyly)
                    Ooopppps.
          
          Elena runs her finger under Jay's chin, then turns and walks away,
          leaving Jay standing there, all taken aback.
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING    - NIGHT
          
          A drunken Marie brings her BMW to a swerving halt outside the
          construction site. She takes a swig from the Champagne bottle on
          the passenger seat for dutch courage...
          
                              MARIE
                        (sotto)
                    It's present time.
          
          She reaches for the car door handle, but comes up short. When she
          looks back up she's in for some taking aback of her own...
          
          Elena comes walking out of the building site, and the two girls
          lock eyes. There's an uncomfortable moment before Elena flashes a
          satisfied smile and walks away...
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell...
          
          Marie's about to get out of her car when Jay comes walking out of
          the site, looks around the lot, sees Marie's car.
          
                              JAY
                    What are you doing here at this time of
                    night?
          
          Marie stammers to find the words...
          
                              MARIE
                    I just...wanted to apologize for my
                    behavior earlier. I was out of line.
          
          Jay's mood lightens.
          
                              JAY
                    When we admit our mistakes we grow.
                    You've made an important step.
          
                              MARIE
                    So...what about my present?
          
                              JAY
                    Meet me at the Museum. Before school
                    tomorrow. Now go home, get some sleep,
                    I'm gonna finish up here...
          
                                                          03/22/2004    18.
          
          
          
          He walks away and a smile creeps across Marie's face.
          
                                                      FADE TO BLACK:
          
          INT. MUSEUM - MORNING
          
          A perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother
          Daughter DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun.
          
          Marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically
          in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand
          towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels...
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    You really think you're ready for your
                    inheritance?
          
          Marie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum, still in
          the same clothes as yesterday...
          
                              MARIE
                    It was...it was what Mom wanted...
          
          Jay looks at her sternly.
          
                              JAY
                    You're the only one who can open that
                    lock, but I'm the one with the key. She
                    wanted you to have the diamonds when you
                    were responsible enough to know what to
                    do with them...
                              M
                              MARIE
                    I'm...responsible...
          
          Jay shakes his head slowly, deliberately.
          
                              JAY
                    Really? Underage drinking, prying into my
                    personal affairs, fighting...
          
                              MARIE
                    But they're mine. Mom left them to me.
          
                              JAY
                    They're yours when I say they're yours.
                    For the time being, I've got some major
                    problems at the construction site.
                    Deadlines have to be met. We'll talk
                    again when you've done some growing up.
          
          Jay puts an arm around his stepdaughter, starts walking her back
          towards the massive wooden doors.
          
                              M
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004    19.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    Please, don't fight me on this.   We're
                    Team Clifford, remember?
          
                              MARIE
                        (without conviction)
                    Team Clifford...
          
          She's stuck in an awkward embrace with her Step Father...
          
          EXT. MUSEUM - MORNING
          
          Jay leads Marie down the stone steps outside the quaint Museum
          building. But as they approach his car they're hit by...BLUE and
          RED FLASHING LIGHTS.
          
          The whine of sirens has Jay spinning around in surprise, looking
          over to see four Police Cruisers come to a screeching halt...
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell?
          
          Half a dozen of Blue Bay's finest, lead by the dashing young
          OFFICER ENTWISTLE, draw their badges, approach Jay.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    Mr. Clifford?
          
                              JAY
                    Can I help you, Officer?
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    You're under arrest on suspicion of rape.
          
          Jay's jaw drops to the ground.
          
                              JAY
                    There must be some mistake, this isn't
                    possible...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay, what's going on?
          
          Entwistle puts a powerful hand on Jay, leads him to the first
          Police cruiser.      J
                               AY
                    Call my lawyer, tell him to meet me down
                    the station. This is outrageous...
          
          Entwistle gets into the Police car's passenger seat.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   20.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    I didn't do anything, I swear.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    I'm afraid she's got a different story.
          
                              JAY
                    Who's 'she'?
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
          
          Elena paces the sterile interview room like a caged tiger. She
          stops in front of the two way mirror, examines her reflection...
          
          Tentatively she reaches out a trembling finger touching the scab
          on her lip, covering the wound Marie inflicted at the party. And
          slowly Elena starts to press on the cut, until the blood starts to
          flow once more...
          
          There's a quiet knock on the door and Elena quickly lowers her
          hand, looks round...
          
          Kristen Richards, the young Parole Officer who so heart
          wrenchingly told her story at Blue Bay High earlier, comes quietly
          into the gray room.
          
                               KRISTEN
                    Elena.
          
          Elena just looks up at her pitifully.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Could you tell me what happened?
          
          Through stifled sobs, Elena states...
          
                              ELENA
                    It was Jay Clifford. He raped me...
          
          The interview room door swings open and DETECTIVE MICHAEL
          MORRISON, 30's, enters. He's the personification of the term
          "overworked, underpaid."
          
                              MORRISON
                    You understand the seriousness of this
                    allegation, young lady?
          
          Elena nods weakly.
          
                              MORRISON
                    And you know that we'll leave no stone un-
                    turned in the investigation.
          
                                                                       21.
                              MORRISON(CONT'D)
                    There'll be a battery of forensics tests
                    you'll have to take, humiliating stuff.
                    And background checks, digging up all
                    kinds of dirt. And you'll have to testify
                    in court, face the man you're accusing...
          
          Crocodile tears roll down Elena's cheeks.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You sure you want to go through with
                    this? No harm, no foul, you can just walk
                    away right now....
          
          Kristen interjects...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Please, Detective, this isn't the right
                    time...
          
                              ELENA
                    I ain't lying. You think I'm lying?
          
          Kristen turns to her young ward...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    If you're telling the truth, you won't
                    find a more sympathetic ear...
          
                              ELENA
                    'If' I'm telling the truth...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And if you're not, there's gonna be
                    trouble, you understand?
          
                              MORRISON
                    This is already trouble. The man you're
                    accusing happens to be a friend of mine,
                    and when the DNA tests prove you're lying
                    I'm gonna come down on you like a ton of
                    bricks, mark my words...
          
          Elena withers under his glare...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
          
          Jay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and THEO
          BLOOM, his sharp suited attorney.
          
                              THEO
                    We're gonna sue their asses til time runs

                                                           03/22/2004   22.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    You've gotta believe me, I would never,
                    could never do anything like this, you
                    know that don't you?
          
          Marie takes his hand, squeezes it.
          
                              MARIE
                    We're team Clifford.
          
          Jay forces a tired smile...
          
                              JAY
                    That's my girl.
          
          The door swings open and Morrison enters...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Jay. Marie. Mr. Bloom...
          
          Jay stands, shakes Morrison's hand.
          
                              MORRISON
                        (to Marie)
                    Would you mind waiting outside while me
                    and your stepdad have a little chat...
          
          Marie looks to Jay, doesn't want to leave.
          
                              JAY
                    It's OK honey. Michael and I are old
                    pals...
          
          Reluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her.
          Jay sits back down. Morrison takes a chair opposite.
          
                              JAY
                    How's the divorce treating you?
          
                              MORRISON
                    She's taken me for everything I'm worth.
                    I swear to God, I'm never trusting
                    another woman as long as I live.

                              THEO
                    This is most egregious, Detective, my
                    client has pressing matters at his
                    construction site. He can't afford to
                    waste time with this frivolous
                    nonsense...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   23.
          
          
          
                              MORRISON
                        (to Jay)
                    Look, we're taking her statement right
                    now, gonna run every forensic test in the
                    book. Guarantee the case'll come apart
                    like a $2 watch...
          
          Jay nods, certain he can beat this rap...
          
                              JAY
                    She had my camcorder. Recorded what
                    happened. It should still be at the
                    construction site. It'll clear my name...
          
          Morrison nods.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You'll be outta here by tonight.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Marie waits out in the anonymous hallway, talking a mile-a-minute
          on her cell phone...
          
                              MARIE (ON PHONE)
                    I can't believe it, Jenny...It just
                    doesn't make sense...I mean, I know
                    Jay...I know he'd never...
          
          When a door down the hall opens she looks up expectantly, only to
          see Kristen come out, walk towards her, followed by someone.
          Marie's view is blocked by Kristen until the Parole Officer passes
          her and reveals...Elena.
          
                              MARIE
                    This can't be...
          
          A look somewhere between horror and shock is etched on Marie's
          beautiful face. Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss.
          
                              ELENA
                    No such word as 'can't'...
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - DAY
          
          Police cars line the driveway outside the beach front building
          site. Officers cordon off the road as Forensics teams photograph
          every inch of the building...
          
          Standing amidst the crowd of onlookers is an irate Mr. Barajas,
          accompanied, as ever, by Cicatriz. They are both on CELLPHONES,
          both talking angry, fast Spanish.
          
                                                               03/22/2004   24.
          
          
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Plastic sheeting covers the windowless top floor of the unfinished
          condos. The white suited FORENSICS TEAM work meticulously, led by
          the tireless Dr. Chad Borman, delicately dusting anything and
          everything that might yield evidence...
          
          Morrison stands at the edge of an area cordoned off by POLICE
          TAPE. He's looking at Jay's smashed DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA, now
          bagged and tagged as evidence...
          
                              KRISTEN (O.S.)
                    Sexual predators often keep a trophy...
          
          Morrison spins, sees Kristen. He stumbles with his words, not used
          to talking to beautiful women...
          
                                 MORRISON
                    I'm sorry?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Maybe he recorded the rape.
          
          Morrison looks at the remains of the camera.
          
                              MORRISON
                    And maybe he didn't. We'll never know.
                    Tape's mangled. Forensics said it'd take
                    months to fix it.
          
          He looks up into Kristen's hypnotic eyes.
          
                              MORRISON
                    We were never properly introduced.
                    Michael Morrison.
          
          She offers her hand, and Morrison shakes it.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Miss Richards. Kristen. Miami Parole. Was
                    just in town for a couple days checking
                    in on some parolees when all this went
                    down...
          
          She hands Morrison a BUSINESS CARD, which he absently stuffs into
          his pocket...
          
                              MORRISON
                    You think maybe you could lean on the
                    girl? Get her to drop this nonsense? We
                    all know she's lying. With all this Black
                    widow shit going down, we just don't have
                    the time or manpower to...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   25.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    She might not be lying, you know.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What makes you think that?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Just a look in her eye. I...I have some
                    experience...
          
          Morrison doesn't want to push her further...
          
          All of a sudden the sunlight is blocked from the massive
          unfinished floor by black sheets erected by the Forensics team,
          leaving everyone in pitch darkness....
          
                              MORRISON
                    What the hell?
          
          Slowly an eerie ULTRA VIOLET GLOW fills the room. The white suited
          forensics technicians, glowing under the black light, wait
          patiently for evidence to show itself...
          
          Suddenly the clear IMPRINTS of hands on the wall become clear,
          along with the black stains of BLOOD FLECKS...
          
                                CHAD
                    Gotcha...
          
                              MORRISON
                    What is it?
          
                              CHAD
                    Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle.
                    I'd say we've got a rape on our hands,
                    Detective, but we won't know for sure
                    until we run the tests...
          
          Morrison's head is spinning...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Fine. Just do it...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT
          
          Elena sits on the edge of a gurney in the high tech forensics lab,
          rubbing her arm where a band-aid covers a fresh needle mark. Chad
          appears at the doorway and she stares daggers at him.
          
                              ELENA
                    You vampires really need five pints of my
                    blood? That's like an armful...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   26.
          
          
          
          Chad's surprised by her venom.
          
                              CHAD
                    It's standard procedure in a rape test.
                    Test for drugs and such...
          
                                 ELENA
                    And such.
          
          She continues to pace as Chad makes his way into the room, rounds
          the desk and takes down a plastic beaker from the metal shelf.
          
                              CHAD
                    We're going to need a urine sample. Do
                    you think you could fill this?
          
                                 ELENA
                    From here?
          
          Chad goes red. Puts the plastic cup down on the desk and Elena
          grabs it.            C
                               HAD
                    If...you wouldn't mind...removing your
                    clothes. I'll leave the room, give you
                    some priv...
          
          The breath catches in Chad's throat as Elena takes her shirt off
          without hesitation. Stands there in just her black bra.
          
                              ELENA
                    Done. Next?
          
          Chad's jaw drops. Not just because Elena's in her underwear, but
          because of the clear BITE MARKS on her neck and arms...
          
                              CHAD
                    Those are...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bite marks. He chowed down.
          
                              CHAD
                    They're clear evidence markers...
          
          He reaches out, grabs a Polaroid Camera from the desk, starts
          snapping away like an ornithologist at a bird convention. The
          FLASH of the camera fills the room...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   27.
          
          
          
          EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
          
          FLASHBULBS explode as Marie accompanies her stepfather up the
          steps of the austere Blue Bay courthouse, surrounded by a gaggle
          of sound bite hungry pressmen...
          
                              REPORTER 1
                    Any comment, Mr. Clifford?
          
          Jay puts his hand up to block the intrusive lenses. He disappears
          quickly into the shelter of the courthouse.
          
                              REPORTER 2
                        (to Marie)
                    Did your stepfather rape that girl? How
                    could he do something like that?                           
          Marie stops in her tracks, wheels around and addresses the throng
          of reporters...

                    Jay...is innocent...

          Jay sits at the defendant's table, suit impeccable, hair
          immaculate, game face on. Theo sits beside him, scribbling notes.
          Marie is in the front row of the gallery, surrounded by her
          coiffured peers. She tries to smile stoically at Jay...

           had is on the stand as ARLO MEESE, 35, the slick District
          Attorney, steps forward.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Dr. Borman, do your tests show that Elena                  
                    Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the                     
                    night of the 25th?                                         
                              CHAD                                             
                    Yes they do.                                               
                              D.A. MEESE                                       
                    Do they show that it was forced?                           
          
                                                         03/22/2004   28.
          
          
          
                              CHAD
                                                                               
                    Yes. There was extensive bruising and
                    tearing. We found no semen evidence. The
                    latex abrasions point to the use of
                    protection. This is quite common in cases
                    of premeditated rape.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    And what can you tell us about Miss
                    Sandoval's toxicology reports, Doctor?
          
                              CHAD
                    Came back positive for Rohypnol, a common
                    date rape drug. Traces were also found on
                    the bottle of beer at the crime scene.
                    Both Mr. Clifford and Miss Sandoval's
                    fingerprints were all over the bottle.
          
                              JAY
                    I took it from her. She was far too young
                    to be drinking!
          
          A slam of the gavel silences Jay.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Dr. Borman I am going to show you what's                   
                    been marked as state's exhibit number 1.                   
          He nods to the bailiff and a PROJECTOR whirs to life. An EVIDENCE
          PHOTO that Chad took of Elena's wounds is displayed on a screen
          beside him.
          
                              D.A. MEESE                                       
                    What does this slide show?                                 
                              CHAD
                    Miss Sandoval was found to have numerous
                    bite marks on her upper torso that
                    occurred during the rape.
          
                              JUDGE WILCOX
                    What about those other markings?
          
          Chad looks confused, studies the slide, sees four equidistant dots
          aligned in a small circle.
          
                              CHAD
                    I wasn't able to determine...Fingernail
                    markings, possibly...
          
                              JUDGE WILCOX

          Marie can barely breathe...
          
                              D.A. MEESE                                       
                    I'm going to show you another slide                        
                                                                               
                    that's been marked as state's exhibit
                    number 2.                                                  
          
                                                                               
          Meese nods to the bailiff, who dutifully changes the slide. The
          court goes dark for a second before the next slide is                
          displayed...It's a close up of Jay's teeth mouldings compared to     
                                                                               
          the bite marks...
          
                               D.A. MEESE                                      
                                                                               
                    What can you tell us about these
                    mouldings?                                                 
                              CHAD
                    They were made from the defendant's                        
                    teeth, and the tests I conducted show                      
                    there's simply no other conclusion. The
                    bite marks on Miss Sandoval's body were
                    made by the defendant, Mr. Jay
                    Clifford...
          
          That's it. The Court erupts, flashbulbs exploding. Jay slumps back
          in his chair, his air of cool gone in an instant. He looks back at
          Marie, utter disbelief on his face. The tears well in her eyes...
          
          The Judge bangs his gavel in a vain attempt to regain control.

                    ...in the face of damning evidence, Jay
                    Clifford remained defiant. It's thought
                    that his stepdaughter, Marie Clifford
                    will testify in his defense tomorrow. And
                    in other news, officials from the FBI
                    gave a press conference today, commenting
                    on their involvement in the Black widow
                    case...

                    After numerous mistakes on behalf of the
                    local authorities in Blue Bay, the FBI is
                    mobilizing its task force...

          desk, piled high with files, mostly marked BLACK WIDOW, and
          reaches down to pick up Jay's broken video camera, still in the
          evidence bag...

                    It's a long shot.
          
          Morrison looks up, smiles faintly when he sees Kristen at the
          door.
          
                              MORRISON

                    you?
          
          Kristen smiles, enters Morrison's cluttered office.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Used to play at being a spider when I was
                    a kid, creeping around silently. Guess I
                    haven't grown out of it.
          
          Morrison shakes the broken camera parts in the evidence bag.

          The Forensics lab is crammed with evidence bags and files. Chad is
          working diligently, painstakingly scanning a stack of $100 BILLS
          one by one. He barely has time to look round when the door opens
          and Detective Morrison comes in...

          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - DAY
          
          The early morning sun casts a brilliant orange glow over the
          smooth-as-glass surface of the school swimming pool.
          
          Marie steps back up onto the high diving platform. Tries to focus.
          Slides the soon-to-be-diamond ring off her finger and throws it
          tentatively into the water...
          
          She takes a breath and then dives, straight and true, into the
          perfect blue water below.
          
          EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie's lithe, taught body comes arcing through the water, darting
          down to the bottom of the pool to retrieve the ring...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie surfaces, reaches out and puts the ring on the side of the
          pool, before looking up to see an old pair of sneakers, an
          electronic ankle bracelet locked around one leg.

                    landing...
          
          Marie's blood boils.
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell are you doing here?
          
          Elena just reaches down and picks up Marie's unfinished ring.
          
                              ELENA
                    Looks like your bling ain't blinging...
          
                              MARIE
                    Give me that back. It was my Mother's...
          
          Marie climbs out of the pool, faces down with Elena...
          
                              ELENA
                    Looks like she got ripped off Princess,
                    where's the rock?
          
          Marie snatches the ring from Elena, slides it back on her finger.
          
                              MARIE
                    Is that what this is all about?
          
          Elena reaches out, tries to stroke the wet hair off Marie's face.
          She recoils before she'll let Elena touch her...
          
                              ELENA
                    You're not a dumb as you look...

                    We got trouble...
          
          Elena won't back down.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're ruining my life, and my
                    stepfather's.
          
                              ELENA
                    It can end. Just like that.
          
          She snaps her fingers and Marie's on the verge of tears...
          
                                                         03/22/2004   33.
          
          
          
          Jenny and the rest of the diving team approach, stand behind
          Marie, a seething mass of bikini-clad mindless hate...
          
                              MARIE
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              ELENA
                    Because I can.
          
          As she turns and walks away...
          
                              ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Good luck in court.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY COURTROOM - DAY
          
          The usual assortment of paparazzi and spectators crowd into the
          small courtroom.
          
          Marie is on the witness stand, staring straight ahead at her
          stepfather at the defendant's table. Gone is the immaculate suit,
          the perfect hair, the poker face. He's looking worried now...
          
          Theo paces in front of Marie, running her through a series of well-
          rehearsed questions.
          
                              THEO
                    And why did you go to your stepfather's
                    building site that night, Miss Clifford?
          
                              MARIE
                    It was my birthday. Jay left the party
                    before giving me my present.
          
                              THEO
                    And you say you saw Miss Sandoval
                    leaving?
          
          Marie takes a moment, looks to Elena at the Prosecution table.
          
                              MARIE
                    I did.
          
                              THEO
                    And how would you describe her
                    appearance?
          
                              MARIE
                    She was...she looked fine. She smiled at
                    me. Actually smiled...
          
                              THEO
                    No further questions.
          
                                                          03/22/2004   34.
          
          
          
          He takes a seat next to Jay, whispers in his ear. D.A. Meese
          starts his cross-examination.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Would it be fair to say you don't like
                    Elena Sandoval, Miss Clifford?
                              M
                              MARIE
                    We don't see...eye to eye...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Is that why you attacked her at your
                    party earlier that night?
          
          Marie squirms.
          
                              MARIE
                    No...I was...she wasn't invited...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    You'd had a few drinks, correct?
          
                              MARIE
                        (reluctantly)
                    I'd had a drink. Yes.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    So by the time you allege to have seen
                    Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court
                    exactly how much you'd had to drink?
          
                              MARIE
                    A glass of Champagne. Or two, but...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    No further questions.
          
          Jay sinks a few inches lower in his seat. Going down...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - DAY
          
          A bleary eyed Chad sits in front of a bank of monitors, working
          the image enhancement equipment, fighting to get a watchable
          picture from the fuzzy static in front of him. Kristen sits behind
          him, fighting to stay awake.
          
                              CHAD
                        (to himself)
                    Take out the chroma, raise the
                    luminescence...
          
          He clumsily reaches over the control panel, hitting almost every
          button on the way. And that does the trick...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   35.
          
          
          
          Suddenly the picture on the monitors becomes clear. Kristen's eyes
          snap open.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    H
                     oly shit...
          
          The pixilated image of Elena smiling comes into focus on the TV...
          
                              KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                    Call Detective Morrison. Now...
          
          SCENE OMITTED
          
          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS- DAY
          
          The shaky, pixilated image of Elena smiling flickers on the TV.
          Soon enough though her smile fades...
          
                              ELENA (ON TAPE)
                    You're kidding right?
          
          Jay's voice can be heard behind the camera...
          
                              JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          The video shows Elena cowering...
          
                              ELENA (ON TAPE)
                    Please...you can't do this...
          
                              JAY (O.S ON TAPE)
                    No such word as can't...
          
          A hand reaches out from behind the video camera and grabs Elena,
          throws her violently against a concrete wall.
          
                                 JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)
                    Fuck me...
          
          A flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus. When the
          camera steadies again, Elena's hands are pressed against the wall
          and she's sobbing... E
          
                               LENA (ON TAPE)
                    Please, Mr. Clifford, don't...
          
                              JAY (O.S ON TAPE)
                    Just try to keep those legs together...
          
          And then static...
          
                                                         03/22/2004   36.
          
          
          
          Pulling back from the TV we find ourselves in the courtroom,        
                                                                              
          completely empty, save for Jay, Theo, Meese and Judge Wilcox all
          staring in shock at the blank TV screen...                          
          
                                                                              
                              D.A. MEESE
                    If Mr. Clifford would plead guilty to                     
                    rape, the state is prepared to drop the                   
                                                                              
                    charges of kidnapping and assault.
          
                               JUDGE WILCOX
                                                                              
                        (to Jay)
                    If I were you I would seriously consider                  
                    the offer.                                                
          INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY
          
          In the cold stone jail visiting room, Jay sits behind the wire
          mesh, an emotion Marie and Theo opposite. The PRISON GUARD waits
          by the barred door, keeping his beady eyes on Jay.
          
                              JAY
                    I'm gonna lose this trial.
          
                              THEO
                    I'm not so sure about that. The tape's a
                    fake, right? So all we need to do is...
          
          Jay holds up a hand, instantly silencing his attorney.
          
                              JAY
                    You had your chance.
                        (to Marie)
                    If we're gonna win at all costs, we're
                    gonna have to change the game.
                        (to Theo)
                    Do you have it?
          
          Theo nods regretfully, reaches into a breast pocket, pulls out a
          KEY.
          
                              THEO
                    I'm still dead set against this, Jay.
          
                              JAY
                    I couldn't care less.
          
                              MARIE
                    What's the key for?
          
                              JAY
                    The diamonds...If that's what it takes,
                    then that's what it takes...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   37.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    But...they're my inheritance...
          
                              JAY
                    All my assets are tied up in the condos,
                    Marie. We have to pay this girl off, make
                    her testify that she faked the tape,
                    faked the evidence.
          
                              MARIE
                    But, Jay...they're my diamonds...
          
                              JAY
                    As soon as I'm out of here, you'll have
                    them back. I swear. I know people, who
                    can...persuade her to hand them over...
          
          Marie shoots an uncomfortable look to Theo, then back at Jay,
          uncertain what to say.
          
                              MARIE
                    I
                     t's wrong.
          
                              JAY
                    More wrong than what she's doing to us?
                    We're team Clifford, right? You know I'm
                    not guilty. You know I could never do
                    anything like this. So do the right thing
                    and get me out of this hellhole...
          
          Marie's cracking...
          
                                 MARIE
                    I can't...
          
                              JAY
                        (tenderly)
                    No such word as 'can't.' Please...
          
          The tears well in her eyes.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
          
          The key slips easily into the lock below the dazzling Mother
          Daughter diamonds. The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to
          reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems...
          
          The Curator stands behind her in the empty Museum hall, ruefully
          watching his prize exhibit being removed.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I knew the day would come, still doesn't
                    make it any easier...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   38.
          
          
          
          Marie, tears welling in her eyes, takes a hold of the diamonds,
          carefully takes them from the case.
          
                              CURATOR
                    The offer still stands, Marie. If you
                    ever decide to sell them, please give us
                    a first chance...
          
          Marie turns to him, the emotions overwhelming her.
          
                              MARIE
                    I don't think I'll be able to, I'm
                    sorry...
          
          She scampers towards the door, past the security guards.
          
                              CURATOR
                        (sotto)
                    Me too...
          
          EXT. THE GATOR TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
          
          Theo's SUV drives carefully down the mud path running parallel to
          the swamp, past countless rusted airboats, and into the 'GATOR'
          trailer park, finally coming to a halt in front of Elena's rotting
          trailer. Theo gets out carefully, his $1000 shoes sinking into the
          mud. Marie reluctantly steps out of the car...
          
          A blinding PORCH LIGHT flicks on. Theo and Marie spin round,
          squint through the light to see Elena standing in her trailer
          doorway...           E
                               LENA
                    Well, well, well. Look what the cat
                    dragged in...
                        (to Theo)
                    DA know you're here?
          
          Theo squirms...
          
                              MARIE
                    We need to talk.
          
                               ELENA
                    So talk.
          
                              THEO
                    Somewhere private, maybe?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   39.
          
          
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          An elderly man, UNCLE MARTY, in a sweat-stained T-shirt and ratty
          underwear, snores on the tattered recliner, a half-drunk bottle of
          WHISKY hanging from one limp hand...
          
          Theo freezes when he sees him...
          
                              THEO
                    Who's this?
          
                              ELENA
                    Uncle Marty. Legal Guardian. Drunken
                    pervert, take your pick. Chill. He's out
                    til morning.
          
          Uncle Marty's deafening SNORES confirm the assertion as Elena
          leads them into her bedroom...
          
                              MARIE
                    Let's just get this over with.
                        (to Elena)
                    You won. You got what you wanted...
          
                              ELENA
                        (mocking)
                    I just wanted justice...
          
                              THEO
                    Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the
                    jury you faked the evidence, faked the
                    tape...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sarcastic)
                    Really?
          
                              MARIE
                    We are prepared to make it worth your
                    while.
          
          She holds the Daughter diamond in front of Elena's greedy little
          eyes.
          
                              ELENA
                        (poker face)
                    Not bad. But I always wanted a family...
          
          Theo nudges Marie. She sighs, holds out the Mother diamond in the
          other hand. A broad grin stretches across Elena's face.
          
          F
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   40.
          
          
          
                              THEO
                    They're yours after you exonerate my
                    client.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'm afraid I'm gonna need that payment up
                    front.
          
                              MARIE
                    No, that's not the deal.
          
                              ELENA
                    It is now. Take it or leave it.
          
          Marie takes a deep breath. It's the most difficult thing she's
          ever had to do in her young life. Dead silence, except for Uncle
          Marty's snoring from the front room.
          
           inally, with a very heavy heart, Marie hands over the diamonds.
          
                              THEO
                    When this is all over, you'll leave town.
                    For good.
          
          Elena points to the ankle bracelet.
          
                              ELENA
                    I go more than five miles from the police
                    station and I'm straight back in juvie...
          
                              THEO
                    I understand your Parole term is up next
                    week.
          
          Elena smiles.
          
                              ELENA
                    You've done your homework. Fine.
                        (points to the ankle bracelet)
                    As soon as this thing comes off, I'm
                    outta here...
          
          She reaches down and grabs the diamonds. Dances past Marie...
          
                              THEO
                    May I suggest a little discretion, Miss
                    Sandoval. Certain...questions might be
                    asked about this...arrangement if you
                    were to...say...turn up to Blue Bay High
                    wearing a tiara...
          
          Elena winks.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   41.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    I ain't gonna flaunt it, mate. I gots too
                    much class for that shit.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're going to tell the truth on the
                    stand tomorrow, yes?
          
          Elena raises her right hand...
          
                              ELENA
                    I swear to tell the truth, the whole
                    truth and nothing but the truth...
          
          INT. COURTROOM - DAY
          
          The court Bailiff nods, takes the Bible from Elena's hands. She's
          dressed in the closest thing to a modest suit she has in her
          wardrobe; a low cut jacket and tiny miniskirt...
          
          The courtroom is packed with journalists, TV cameras and nosey
          neighbors. Everyone wants a piece of this story. At the
          defendant's table, Jay, slick once more in Armani, watches Theo
          approach the witness box with a new-found confidence.
          
          Sitting in the front row of the public gallery, Marie is riveted
          on the action. At the back of the courtroom, Kristen fidgets
          nervously beside Morrison as Theo steps up, ready to question the
          newly compliant star witness in this sensational rape trial...
          
                              THEO
                    It's your assertion that my client, Mr.
                    Clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you
                    on the night of the 25th. Is that true?
          
          A hushed silence. Marie, Jay, Theo all wait expectantly...
          
                              THEO
                    Is that what you say happened?
          
          Elena clears her throat.
          
                              ELENA
                    He... He didn't...
          
          A collective intake of breath from the crowd.
          
                              ELENA
                    ....just sexually assault me.
          
          Theo's balls shrink instantly.
          
                                                         03/22/2004   42.
          
          
          
                              THEO
                    What...did you just say?
          
                              ELENA
                    He didn't just sexually assault me. He
                    threatened to kill me if I told anyone...
          T
           he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. Theo's
          reeling, caught off-guard, stumbling over his words, trying to
          give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise.
          
                              THEO
                    Isn't it true that you were inebriated
                    during the assault, that it may not in
                    fact have been Mr. Clifford...Or anyone?
          
          A smirking Meese doesn't even bother to stand up.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Objection. Leading the witness.
          
                              JUDGE WILCOX
                    Sustained. Council will please rephrase
                    the question.
          
          Theo's stumped. His eyes plead with Elena to take the ball and run
          with it. She does. Unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone.
          
                              ELENA
                    I was messed up, alright. In fact, only
                    two things I remember. One was that
                    bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that
                    Goddamn video camera while he violated
                    me. The other was what he whispered in my
                    ear, right before I blacked out...
          
          She pauses, for emphasis. Judge, jury, gallery, press corps, the
          town of Blue Bay, the state of Florida hangs on her every word...
          
                              ELENA
                    He said, "You won't remember, but you'll
                    never forget."
          
          That's it. The court goes berserk, flashbulbs exploding, along
          with the veins in Jay's head.
          
          Kristen's reeling from shock...
          
                              KRISTEN
                        (to Morrison)
                    What did she just say?
          
          Marie leaps to her feet, screams...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   43.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    Lying bitch!
          
          Marie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to
          claw Elena's tear stained eyes out...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          A small Television blares out today's top story...
          
                              ACTION NEWS ANCHOR
                    The young victim's wrenching testimonial
                    proved to be the final nail in the coffin
                    for Jay Clifford. It took less than an
                    hour for the jury to deliberate and
                    sentence Mr. Clifford to 15 years.
          T
           V cameras witness Jay being led away in handcuffs...
          
                              JAY (ON TV)
                    You can't do this to me! You can't...YOU
                    CAN'T!
          
          CLICK. The TV turns off. Marie sits huddled in Jay's unfinished
          concrete building site office, staring at the darkened television
          set. Mascara laden tear tracks line her perfect face.
          
                              MARIE
                        (mumbling)
                    No such thing as can't...
          
          She lets the champagne bottle slip through her fingers and it
          smashes on the concrete floor. Strangely the dregs of the
          champagne start running down the floor...
          
          Marie's heart suddenly skips a beat as she thinks she hears the
          rustling of plastic from outside the office.
          
                              MARIE
                    Who's there?
          
          No answer. She steels herself, gets shakily to her feet, stumbling
          drunkenly toward the door...
          
          EXT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen stands in the darkened doorway of Elena's less-than-
          welcoming trailer. She knocks.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Elena. Open up.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   44.
          
          
          
          No answer. She tries the door handle. It's unlocked. She takes a
          deep breath, steps inside.
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen flips on a light switch. The room is illuminated for a
          split second before the bulb surges and burns out, leaving Kristen
          in the near-darkness...
          
                               KRISTEN
                    Elena?   Hello?
          
          She takes out a FLASHLIGHT, creeps through the front room,
          stepping over the discarded pizza boxes and assorted detritus.
          
          The beam of light finds a small BLUE PILL nestled in the
          carpeting. Kristen picks it up, slides it into her pocket...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Marie steps cautiously through the unfinished concrete top floor,
          past the crime scene tape. In the dim light, her eyes dart to
          every corner, every shadow.
          S
           he lets out a surprised shout as the room is suddenly plunged
          into darkness. Slowly the eerie forensic ULTRA VIOLET LIGHTS
          switch on, filling the room with black light.
          
          And with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach, Marie slowly
          turns, coming face to face with...
          
          Elena, her arch-nemesis...
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen moves slowly into Elena's bedroom, shines her light on the
          walls. What she sees makes the blood run chill in her veins.
          Barely able to breathe, she takes out her cell phone.
          
                              KRISTEN
                        (into phone)
                    Detective Morrison...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elena and Marie stare each other down. You could cut the tension
          with a chainsaw, until...
          
                              MARIE
                    Who invited you?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   45.
          
          
          
          A sinister grin spreads across Elena's face as she holds up the
          breathtaking Mother-Daughter diamonds, reflecting an unearthly

                              ELENA
                    Mother and Daughter...
          
          This brings a mile-wide smile to Marie as she dances into Elena's
          arms. Their lips come together in a passionate kiss as their hands
          dance over each other's trembling bodies. When they finally
          break...
          
                              MARIE
                    I was sure you'd blow it on the stand,
                    going on about forgetting and
                    remembering.
          
                              ELENA
                    Gotta make it seem authentic. God's in
                    the details.
          
          And they kiss again, lips locked tighter than Jay's jail cell...

          Morrison's unmarked sedan pulls to a stop beside Kristen's car,
          and the harried Detective steps out, looking extremely unhappy.

          Elena and Marie are locked in their carnal embrace, failing to
          notice the florescent lights flickering back on. Suddenly Elena
          feels the sharp pain of teeth biting into her neck...
          
          She looks down to see DENTAL ALGINATE MOLDINGS of Jay's teeth
          being held by a smiling Chad.
          
                              CHAD
                    Mind if Chad joins?
          
          The girls look up to see a beaming Chad, holding the teeth
          molding. Elena just shakes her head...
          
                                 ELENA
                    Fuck me...
          
          Chad works the spring hinge of the dentures like a deranged
          ventriloquist act...
          
                              CHAD
                    Any time. Any place...
          
          He sets the dentures down on the concrete floor, and takes in the
          sight of the magnificent diamonds.
          
                              CHAD

          He and Elena help Marie out of her blouse while Elena runs her
          hands all over him...
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Morrison and Kristen's flashlights cut through the darkness as
          they move back into Elena's bedroom.

          They get into the bedroom and Morrison's jaw goes slack as Kristen
          shines her light on the walls...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Like my life...
          
          The walls are covered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, all concerning
          Kristen's rape: "Police unable to find frat house rapist,"
          "Teenage victim wants 'justice' in rape case," "'You may not
          remember, but you'll never forget,' only thing victim remembers"

          They suddenly freeze as the front door swings open, the blood
          running cold in their veins as Uncle Marty stumbles inside. They
          hold their breath, praying he doesn't see them, standing in
          Elena's doorway. Uncle Marty just mumbles something incoherent and
          collapses face first onto the couch, out like a light...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Chad reaches into an evidence bag filled with BLUE PILLS. He
          removes three...
          
                              CHAD
                    Little blue pills. One of the perks of
                    the job.
          
          Laughter as   the girl's accept the roofies, swallowing them like
          candy. Chad   gulps down the third as Elena begins to run her hands
          up and down   Marie's back and shoulders. Chad's hands are all over
          Marie as he   helps slip off her bra.
          
          Elena's lips move hungrily across Chad's face, until they find his
          mouth. They kiss deeply.
          
           hen they pull apart, Chad helps Elena pull off her T-top, as
          Marie runs her hands up and down Elena's bare back. Elena turns
          back to her with a mischievous grin.

          Jay takes a seat on an uncomfortable metal chair in front of
          bullet-proof glass. He's half the man he used to be, broken,
          trembling, smoking like a chimney. His mind's still a steel trap,
          just one that's rusted shut. He picks up the TWO-WAY PHONE...
          
                              THEO
                        (into phone)
                    Mr. Clifford, this is Kristen Richards,
                    Elena Sandoval's probation officer.
          
                              JAY
                    She want to pin me for some more crimes?
          
          Kristen takes the phone from Theo.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    No, Mr. Clifford. I just have a few
                    questions. I've noticed some
                    inconsistencies...
          
                              JAY
                    You've noticed some inconsistencies?
          
                              JAY
                    Here's one big fucking glaring
                    inconsistency for you: I was set up!
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Maybe so, but that's not good enough. Why
                    were you set up? What would Elena
                    Sandoval have gained from all this?
          
          Jay hesitates, unsure how, or if, to proceed. Theo shifts
          nervously. Jay gives J
                               up.
          
                               AY
                    What the hell. I'm already in jail. How
                    much worse can it get? I paid her off,
                    okay? My assets were tied up in the
                    condos so we used Marie's diamonds.
                         defensive)
                    It wasn't like I had a choice. She had me
                    by the short an' curlies, understand?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   49.

                    But Elena's testimony was damning. Why
                    wouldn't she play ball?
          
                              JAY
                    What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?
                    How the fuck should I know? Manipulative
                    little skank probably figured she could
                    bleed me for some more money down the
                    road. But I'll tell you this much, I'm
                    gonna get those diamonds back, make her
                    wish she was never born.
          
          Kristen's mind is racing, trying to piece together the puzzle.
          
          EXT. SWAMP - DAY
          
          Elena's airboat blasts through the reeds out into the middle of
          nowhere. She cuts the engine, lets the boat drift, unwraps the
          moldings of Jay's teeth from a cloth, as well as a VIDEO TAPE
          marked "BLUE BAY DIVING MEET/MARIE'S BIRTHDAY", looks them over
          one last time...

          Elena glides her airboat to a stop on the muddy banks of the
          trailer park, stomps over to her trailer, when she sees...
          
          Two sets of tire tracks in the mud.
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - MORNING
          
          Elena stands in her bedroom, disbelief washing over her. No sign
          of the newspaper articles. Her walls are barren.

          The diving team emerges from the locker room on their way to
          practice. Lagging behind is Marie. She's about to catch up when
          she runs smack dab into a panicked Elena.

                    problems...
          
          Before anyone can see them, Marie pulls her away, to the outdoor
          shower area, out of sight from her teammates. She turns on all
          the shower heads.
          
                              MARIE
                    Gotta be careful. Make sure no one's
                    listening. Now what's the 411?

                    I...I think I fucked up...
          
          Marie gently takes a hold of Elena's face.
          
                              MARIE
                    How?
          
                              ELENA

                    bitch Parole officer's made me...she was
                    at my trailer last night...
          
          Marie smiles, pulls Elena close as the steam rises all around.
          
                              MARIE
                    No bigee. You disposed of everything,
                    right? The teeth, the video, all the
                    research...
          
          Elena can't fess up. Not now...

                    I did, but...She's got a hard on for me.
                    Wants to see me back in Juvie...
          
          Marie kisses her softly on the forehead. Her cheek.
          
                              MARIE
                    I won't let the big bad wolf get you. I
                    promise.
          
          Elena's damp tank top clings to her perfect body.
          
                              ELENA
                    I just want outta here.
          
          Marie brushes a strand of hair away from Elena's face.

          Sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface, illuminating Marie's
          lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until...
          
          Marie comes diving down into the crystalline water, plucks the
          soon-to-be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - DAY
          
          Marie surfaces at the edge of the pool. She places the ring onto
          the deck, pulls herself out of the water.
          
          She tries not to show surprise when she comes face to face with
          Kristen, who's picked up her ring, runs it around her fingers...
          
                              MARIE
                    Can I help you?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I was wondering if I could have a moment
                    of your time. Ask a couple questions.
          
          Marie glances nervously back at the pool, where other members of
          the diving team go about their workout.
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm in the middle of practice...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It'll only take a moment, Marie. Might
                    even help Jay. Remember your loving
                    stepfather? You want to help him, don't
                    you?
          
                                 MARIE
                    Of course.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   52.
          
          
          
          Kristen studies the ring for a moment, then ventures...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Why'd you agree to part with your
                    diamonds?
          
          This time Marie can't hide her shock.
          
                              MARIE
                    How...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Jay told me. But why? They were your
                    inheritance.
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay needed help. We're a team.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Team Clifford. Right. It's just...You
                    must've been pretty unhappy when Jay
                    didn't give you those diamonds for your
                    birthday.
          M
          Marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing.
          
                              MARIE
                    He said I wasn't ready.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're 18. That's heiress payday, no?
                    Must've crossed your mind that Jay might
                    never let you have them...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, of course not.
          
          She's a bad liar.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And then this little scam artist saunters
                    in and just takes them. With your help,
                    no less.
          
          Kristen moves in for the kill.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    But what I don't get is, why wouldn't
                    Elena do what Jay asked, clear his name?
                    After all, she'd gotten what she wanted.
          
                              MARIE
                    How should I know?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   53.
          
          
          
          Marie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the
          ring against the back of her hand. Hard. Winces, then...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I mean, the only way I can make sense of
                    it is if somehow getting Jay released
                    from prison would spoil the plan.
          
                                 MARIE
                    What plan?
          
          She hands the ring back to Marie. Not so lucky anymore...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You tell me...

          INT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Chad strolls gingerly down the hallway, opens the door to the
          forensics lab, freezing when he sees...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD FORENSICS - DAY
          
          Kristen, waiting patiently for him.
          
                              CHAD
                    Miss...Richards. Is...Is there something
                    I can do for you?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I was wondering if you'd do me the favor
                    of running a quick test.
          
                              CHAD
                    Uh, sure, I guess. Whatcha got for me?
          
          She hands him the Blue Pill she found in Elena's trailer.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Could you tell me what this is?
          
          Chad tries to keep his cool.
          
                              CHAD
                    No problemo. It'll only take a minute.
          
          While Chad goes about his work, Kristen begins nosing around the
          office. Chad looks over his shoulder.
          
                              CHAD
                    Be careful, I got lots of evidence here.
          
          She starts flipping through EVIDENCE PHOTOS...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   54.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Are these the evidence photos from the
                    Elena Sandoval rape?
          
                              CHAD
                    They are, but...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Ever find out what caused these markings?
          
          She holds up the photograph of the four circular indentations the
          Judge questioned Chad about in court...
          
                              CHAD
                    Like I told the Judge, I guess they're
                    finger nail markings...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    They don't look like finger nail markings
                    to me. They look more like this...
          
          She holds up the back of her hand, where she'd made the
          indentation with Marie's ring.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Would you say these markings are the
                    same?
          
                              CHAD
                    W-where did you get that?
          
          Kristen smiles.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Marie gave it to me. But you already knew
                    that, didn't you, Doc?
          
          Chad has no answer to that. He can only blink stupidly and pray
          his silence doesn't incriminate him further. Kristen heads for the
          door...
          
                              CHAD
                        (calling after)
                    The pill. It's Rohypnol. Uh, Roofies.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Been there. Done that.
          
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - NIGHT
          
          The massive front door swings open and Marie crosses the foyer,
          and is about to ascend the magnificent staircases when she hears
          the clanking of glass coming from the kitchen.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   55.
          
          
          
          Her heart is in her throat as she calls out...
          
                                 MARIE
                       Hello?
          
          No answer.
          
                                                                               
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Marie enters the lavish kitchen, stops in her tracks when she sees
          Chad standing at the full bar, mixing the strongest drink known to
          man.
          
                                 MARIE
                       What the hell, Chad?                                    
          Chad fidgets nervously.
          
                                 CHAD
                       That parole officer was sniffin' around
                       today.
          
          Marie scoffs, steps up to the bar, gets in Chad's face.
          
                                 MARIE
                       Not you too. She's just trying to prove
                       her worthless excuse for an existence.
                       She doesn't have a thing on us.
          
                                 CHAD
                       Yeah, but she's askin' the right
                       questions. It's only a matter of time. We
                       gotta make our move.
          
          Marie shakes her head, resolute.
          
                                 MARIE
                       No. We stick to the plan. Give the
                       Curator time to come up with the money...
          
          Chad's trembling hands pour the drink, most of the liquid making
          it in to two MARTINI GLASSES...
          
                                 CHAD
                       We gotta move fast, keep the heat off...
          
                                 MARIE
                       You can't take the heat, get outta the
                       kitchen.
          
                                 CHAD                                          
                       I wanna see 'em. The diamonds.   Make                   
                       sure they're safe.                                      
          
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
          
          
          
          
                                                                       56.
          
          
          
                              MARIE                                                
                                                                                   
                    They're safe.
          
          She downs half the drink in one giant gulp.
          
                              CHAD                                                 
                    I just wanna see 'em. I thought we were                        
                                                                                   
                    supposed to be partners here.
          
          Chad's trembling, looking like he could lose it at any second.
          
                              MARIE                                                
                    You're gonna be the death of me...                             
          She slugs the rest of the drink, strides away and Chad follows           
          like a lapdog...                                                         
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                             
          Nothing's been touched in Jay's office, the drops of blood the           
          Cubans extracted from his thumb as a warning stain the white             
          carpet black...                                                          
          Marie walks over to his desk, opens a draw. Removes a metallic           
          lock box.                                                                
                              CHAD                                                 
                    Open it. I wanna see those puppies.                            
          Marie rolls her eyes, takes a key from a delicate chain around her 
          neck and fumbles with the lock. Finally she opens the box,         
          revealing the Mother-Daughter diamonds, resting on velvet lining.  
          
          The sparkling diamonds seem to have a calming effect on Chad.      He
          stops shaking, his voice becoming more steady...                         
                              CHAD
                    I called the museum. The deal's goin'
                    down tomorrow. 8 am...
          
          Marie stumbles as she takes a step toward him.
          
                              MARIE
                    What did you...
          
          She looks to the empty glass in her hand, then begins to sway,           
          watching in horror as Chad drops the diamonds into his pocket...
                               C

                    I'm sorry, okay? But it's not like I had
                    a choice.

          Marie falls flat on her face, her world crashing to BLACK.

          EXT. EVERGLADES - MORNING
          
          The blinding morning sunlight climbs the horizon, the still water
          of the endless swampland glistening like diamonds...
          
          Elena sits out on her idling airboat, in the midst of the
          sawgrass, smoking. The peace is shattered by her ringing
          CELLPHONE.
          
                               ELENA
                    Yello...
          
                                                                               
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - JAY'S OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Marie has the phone cradled between her shoulder and ear, rubbing  
          her aching head, slowly getting her wits back. Nothing like good
          old fashioned vengeful rage to combat a nasty hangover.
          
                              MARIE
                        (into phone)
                    Chad fucked us.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                        (deadpan)
                    I know. I was there...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, I mean he really fucked us. He
                    drugged me an' took the diamonds!
          
          EXT. SWAMPS - MORNING
          
          Elena stands on the edge of the airboat, fear rising in her.
          
                              ELENA
                     ell me you're kidding...
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Yeah, it's all a big joke...He stole the
                    diamonds!
          
          Elena lets out an anguished wail.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as
                    it is.
          
                              ELENA
                    We've gotta stop him.

          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - KITCHEN - MORNING
          
          Marie's fevered mind is racing as she glances at the wall clock.
          7:30. Finally a desperate plan scratches its way to the surface.
          
                              MARIE
                    He's heading to the museum, got himself
                    an 8am meeting...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    He's gonna sell the diamonds...
          
                              MARIE
                    Not if we find him first...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          The deafening roar of an air boat cutting through dense sawgrass,
          speeding across the endless swampland expanse. Elena expertly
          maneuvers the machine, the wind racing through her hair...
          
          EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
          
          Chad's speakers blare out heavy metal as his rusty DAEWOO bangs
          down the desolate swamp dirt road through the thick trees. Every
          hundred feet or so, the road runs parallel with the water, then
          cuts back into the trees.
          C
           had spots an Air Boat not more than a few hundred yards from him.
          He does a double take just as the road disappears back into the
          trees. That wasn't...it couldn't be, could it?
          
          The winding dirt road crosses back to swampside and Chad's worst
          fears come true...Elena's racing along side of him in the AIRBOAT,
          fighting to keep up...
          
                                 ELENA
                    Pull over!
          
          INT. CHAD'S CAR - DAY
          
          The road runs parallel to the swamp again and Chad's eyes nearly
          burst from their sockets as he sees the airboat now alongside him,
          matching his speed.
          
                              ELENA
                    Give us back the diamonds!
          
          Chad's heart stops.
          
                                 CHAD
                    Us?
          
                                                           03/22/2004   59.
          
          
          
          He spins round, looks straight ahead at the BMW RACING RIGHT AT
          HIM!
          
                              CHAD
                    FUCKING HELL!
          
          He yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off
          the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's
          BMW shoots past, missing his car by inches...
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie slams on her brakes, brings her BMW to a skidding halt on
          the dirt road. She looks back over her shoulder, at the swaying
          Melaluca trees. No sign of Chad's car...
          
          EXT. SWAMPSIDE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Elena brings the airboat to rest at swamp side, leaps into the
          reeds and clambers up to the dirt road. There's no sign of Chad's
          car, just a hole in the dense undergrowth where it ploughed
          through...
          
          Marie comes running up to join Elena, a tire iron in hand...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sternly)
                    We're not hurting him, Marie, got it? We
                    just get the diamonds back...
          
                              MARIE
                    I
                     'm not gonna hurt him. No way...
          
          Marie stalks down the path Chad's car took off the dirt road...
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm gonna kill him.
          
          Elena's breath catches in her throat. Marie disappears into the
          trees and she's alone, out on the deserted swamp road...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie! Don't do this...
          
          She hears a scream, a girl's scream...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie!
          
          Elena sprints into the thick of the trees...
          
                                                              03/22/2004   60.
          
          
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD OFFICES - DAY
          
          Kristen is sitting at Detective Morrison's cluttered desk, her
          brow furrowed as she shuffles through the stack of newspaper
          articles she pulled from Elena's wall.
          
          Morrison stands in the doorway, watching her.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You look like you could use a drink.
          
          Kristen looks up from the articles, into Morrison's smiling face.
          She smiles back.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    When this is all over, I'd like that.
          
          Morrison turns and walks right into a suit with an FBI badge
          identifying him as AGENT MILTON DAMMERS. The buzzcut agent drops
          BOXES at Morrison's feet.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    More Black Widow leads. I need you to put
                    them in the evidence locker, Morrison.
          
                              MORRISON
                    That's not my job, Agent Dammers.

          EXT. SWAMP CLEARING - DAY
          
          Marie is standing in a clearing, staring at Chad's wrecked car, at
          the top of a small slope, wrapped around a Melaluca tree like a
          Christmas present.
          
          Her piercing screams force Elena to come running...
          
                                 ELENA
                    You okay?
          
          Marie stops screaming, her face contorting in anger...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, I'm pretty damn far from okay...
          
          She points to the front seat of the crashed car...
          
          Elena can barely bring herself to look inside. Marie shoves her in
          the back, pushing her towards the open driver's side door. Elena
          gasps when she looks inside the car. Chad's not there.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   61.

          Marie clambers up the wreckage of the car, stands on the roof. She
                               M
          surveys the swamp all around her like the lioness she is...
          
                              MARIE
                    With the diamonds.

          Morrison grumbles as he scans his key card, opening the wire mesh
          door to the evidence locker. He picks up a box and enters,
          Kristen, also carrying a box, a step behind.
          
                              MORRISON
                    I appreciate the help...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Right back at ya.
          
          Morrison blushes as he absently adds the boxes to the groaning
          shelves stuffed with Black Widow evidence. Kristen notices the
          bundles of cash stored in and amongst the Black Widow evidence...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You could have a helluva holiday on that
                    money.

                    Recovered from the Black Widow's last
                    score. If I'd gotten to the scene just
                    five minutes earlier, I woulda gotten her
                    as well...
          
          Morrison shakes his head, ruefully, when a sudden sharp beeping
          has Kristen reaching into her pocket, fishing out a handheld GPS.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    What the hell...
          
          A red flashing dot moves quickly in the middle of the map...

          Elena runs full pelt after Marie, through dense swampland, the
          plastic ankle bracelet around her leg silently flashing red...

                    little weasel!
          
          She swings around, finally spotting a bloody hand print on one of
          the ashen tree trunks...
          
                                MARIE
                    Gotcha...
          
          She races off in hot pursuit. Elena's about to follow when she
          notices the red light flashing on her ankle bracelet...
          
                              ELENA
                    This can't be happening...
          
          Marie slows, looks back to Elena.

                    What now?

          Chad's face is drained of color as he runs through the dense
          swampland, hugging the priceless diamonds. Sweat cascades from his
          brow, and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body
          swirl in the stagnant waters...
          
          Most gruesome of all is a broken TURN SIGNAL embedded in his right
          leg. As the water gets knee-deep, the last of Chad's reserve
          energy goes. He collapses in the stagnant marsh.
          
          Not far off, GATORS circle. It's only a matter of time before they
          notice the blood in the water.

          into the water, her Ankle Bracelet FLASHING RED.
          
                              ELENA
                    Call it off, Marie. We gotta go or
                    she'll find us here...
          
          A splashing sound from up ahead silences both girls...
          
                              MARIE
                    You hear that?
          
          The sound echoes off the dense trees. Marie points left.
          
                              MARIE
                    You go that way...
          
          Marie heads off in the opposite direction. Elena hesitates, wants
          to follow, but does as she's told, and goes left, soon enveloped
          by canopy of trees...
          
          INT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY
          
          Kristen blasts down the Blue Bay streets, a siren in the
          windshield blaring...
          
          The handheld GPS continues to monitor Elena's exact position in
          the midst of the swamp...
          E
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          Elena stumbles through the thick, stagnant water, scouring the
          horizon for any sign of Chad...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sotto)
                    Please...
          
          A rustling sound stops her in her tracks. Dead silence, until...
          
          A HAND GRABS HER LEG, AROUND THE FLASHING ANKLE BRACELET, DRAGS
          HER DOWN INTO THE SWAMP...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES CLEARING - DAY
          
          Marie hacks her way through the overgrown foliage with the tire
          iron, like a Prada clad big-game hunter...
          
                              MARIE
                        (calling out to Elena)
                    You see him?
          
                                                           03/22/2004   64.
          
          
          
          No reply, just her own voice echoing back...
          
                                MARIE
                    Elena?
          
          She rolls her eyes.
          
                              MARIE
                    Useless bitch...
          
          EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
          
          Kristen's unmarked car races across the desolate swamp road.
          
          INT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY
          
          She checks the flashing GPS signal. Getting closer...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          Elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water, gasps for
          breath. Looking down she sees Chad, holding on to her like his
          life depends on it. It does...
          
          He pulls her back down into the water, just as she catches a
          glance of the circling GATORS...
          
          Using her as leverage, Chad pulls himself out of the swamp,
          climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid
          ground...
          
          Elena coughs and splutters, floundering in the blood soaked water.
          The ravenous Gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy...
          
                              CHAD
                    Don't move! Don't splash, they can sense
                    you in the water, they'll rip you to
                    pieces...
          
          Elena freezes, looking round at the black eyes breaking the
          surface of the bloody water, gliding in for the kill...
          
                              ELENA
                    Hel..help me...
          
          She reaches out a hand to Chad, only a few feet away...
          H
           e hesitates, then reaches out to her. But stops short of grabbing
          her trembling hand. Just balls his fist, squeezing every last drop
          of blood out of the open wounds on his palm...
          
          The dark blood cascades down into the water around Elena...
          
                                                                       65.
          
          
          
                              CHAD
                    No.
          
          And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws...
          
          WHACK!
          
          Chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose,
          ears and mouth. He falls forward, stiff as a board, and SPLASHES
          down into the water next to an apoplectic Elena. Behind him stands
          Marie, the BLOODY TIRE IRON in hand...
          
          Marie reaches out a hand, pulls Elena out of the water. She
          collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air...
          
                              MARIE
                    What are you doing? Our diamonds are
                    about to become dinner...
          
          Elena can't move, leaving Marie to wade into the swamp...
          
          EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
          
          Kristen approaches a fork in the swamp road at high speed. She
          checks the GPS scanner. It doesn't show her which way to turn...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Which way, which way...
          
          Split second decision. Left. She spins the wheel, takes the left
          hand fork...
          
          Bad choice. Just a few meters down the right fork is an abandoned
          BMW, an idle airboat, a crashed car, one dead man and two wild,
          wild things...
          
          EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
          
          Elena and Marie, soaked to the bone, drag Chad's cold, dead corpse
          out of the trees. Marie drops the body, heads straight for her
          abandoned BMW. Elena follows, stumbling through the vines, her
          clothes dripping wet, shivering more from nerves than cold...
                               M
                              MARIE
                    Get rid of the body. And his car...
          
                              ELENA
                    Where are you going?
          
                              MARIE
                    Where do you think?
          
                                                                       66.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    I don't...I don't have a clue...
          
          Marie spins round, a vicious look in her eyes. She holds the blood
          soaked diamonds in her hand...
          
                              MARIE
                    Chad made us an appointment to sell
                    these. I'm gonna keep it...
          
          Elena looks down to her flashing ankle bracelet...
          
                              ELENA
                    It's only a matter of time before my
                    Parole Officer finds me...
          
          Marie turns back around, flings open the BMW door and gets in.
          
                              MARIE
                    Then I suggest you get to work...
          
          She fires up the powerful engine, speeds away in a cloud of dust,
          leaving Elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life...
          
          EXT. CHAD'S CRASHED CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          Elena struggles to drag Chad's bloody body back to his crashed
          car. The tail lights flicker, throwing an ominous red glow over
          the dense thicket of overhanging trees.
          
                              ELENA
                        (sotto)
                    Jesus...
          
          With a Herculean effort she manages to stuff Chad's inert body
          into the driver's seat. She stumbles back, horrified at the grim
          tableau before her...
          
          EXT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie's car comes barreling into the parking lot outside the stone
          Museum building.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator paces back and forth, like an expectant father, in
          front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds.
          Marie bursts into the Museum, and he strides up to meet her,
          shocked when he sees Marie's covered in blood, sweat and guilt...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie? Are you alright?
          
                                                           03/22/2004   67.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    Never better. Got the money?
          
          The Curator nods nervously.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I convinced the board of the
                    extraordinary circumstances
                    surrounding...
          
                              MARIE
                    Good.
          S
           he fishes in her bag for the diamonds...
          
                              CURATOR
                    I...I received a call from your
                    'associate'. He said he would be handling
                    the transaction.
          
                              MARIE
                    Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied
                    up at work. Completely swamped...
          
          The Curator nods, unsure if he inquire further...
          
          Marie finally pulls out two blood soaked Diamonds from her bag,
          thrusts them at the Curator. He screws up his wrinkled face,
          afraid to touch them...
          
                              MARIE
                    Calm down. It's just blood.
          
          EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          With trembling hands, Elena opens the trunk of Chad's crashed car.
          She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around
          inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground...
          
          She carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty
          feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match...
          
          She can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in
          fear...
          
          Finally she pulls out a MATCHBOOK, still sopping wet from the
          swamp. She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until,
          finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then
          smoulders out...
          
                              ELENA
                    Don't do this to me, please...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   68.
          
          
          
          In frustration, she runs back to Chad's car, looking desperately
          for a lighter, climbing all the way in. Because of the slight
          slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her.
          
          Elena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove
          compartment.
          
                              ELENA
                    You gotta have a lighter or some...
          
          She's cut off as the WRECKED CAR'S HORN BLARES OUT!
          
          Deafening, the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth. Elena's
          heart skips a beat. Chad's corpse has slumped forward against the
          steering wheel.
          
                               ELENA
                    Jesus...
          
          She struggles with all her might to pull Chad's body back off the
          horn...
          S
           ilence reigns once more. Elena takes short, sharp breaths. Looks
          over at Chad's body slumped to the side, leaning against the
          driver's side door...
          
                              ELENA
                    I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...
          
          Not as sorry as she's going to be...
          
          The match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to
          smoulder for a second, then REIGNITES!
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator carefully examines the diamond, turning it over and
          over in his hands. Marie stands over him, impatiently tapping her
          muddy shoe on the marble floor...
          
                               MARIE
                    So?
          
                              CURATOR
                    I...I'm not sure...
          
                              MARIE
                    Can you get the cash or not?
          
          The Curator looks up to her, bemused.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I can get the cash...it's just...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   69.
          
          
          
          Marie smiles a wicked grin.
          
                              MARIE
                    Then let's have those dead presidents...
          
          EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          The discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the
          ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of
          gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car...
          
          INSIDE THE CAR
          
          Elena reaches over, carefully closes Chad's bloodshot eyes.
          Satisfied, she turns to get out, only to find the passenger side
          door LOCKED...
          
          She tries the handle. Tries it again. Desperately yanks it. Not
          opening, no sir...
          
          Elena looks over, see Chad's limp elbow on the door lock...
          
          OUTSIDE THE CAR
          
          The small brush fire reaches the pooled gasoline and...WHOOSH!
          
          INSIDE THE CAR
          
          Elena can't help but hear the unmistakable sound of FLAMES
          CRACKLING. Through the smashed rear window she sees the line of
          FIRE racing towards the car she's trapped in!
          
          She reaches over, clawing her way past Chad's corpse, trying to
          reach the door lock. Her bloody fingers slip on the lock, unable
          to pull it up.
          
          THE FIRE's SHOOTING towards the crashed car, only a few feet
          away...
          
          Elena fumbles with the lock, tears streaming down her face.
          
          The line of fire hits the crashed car, and ENGULFS it instantly.
          Bright ORANGE FLAMES cover the wreckage...
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator carefully sets down the diamonds on the marble floor.
          Marie looks at him like he's mad.
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                                                             03/22/2004   70.
          
          
          
                              CURATOR
                    One last test...
          
          The Curator hovers his heel over the biggest Diamond. Marie
          screams out!
          
                                MARIE
                    NO!
          
          He slams his foot down and the DIAMOND SHATTERS!
          
          INT. CHAD'S CRASHED CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          Elena SCREAMS as the passenger side window next to her SMASHES,
          SPLINTERING into a million glass fragments.
          
          Hands reach in and grab her, pulling her through the FLAMES...
          
          Seconds later Elena finds herself on the swamp floor, in Kristen's
          singed arms...
          
                                KRISTEN
                    You okay?
          
          Elena can barely talk, looking back at the flaming wreckage in
          front of her...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Care to explain?
          
                              ELENA
                    It was...it was an accident...
          
          The flames reflect in her tear-filled eyes.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie stands aghast at the sight of her diamonds, in a million
          tiny pieces on the museum's marble floor...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Fakes, I'm afraid. Made of glass. Can't
                    believe they were our top attraction all
                    these years...
          
          Every muscle in Marie's body contracts...She stands before the
          empty diamond exhibit case, runs her fingers over the portrait of
          her mother cradling her as a baby.
          
                              MARIE
                    That's my inheritance is it, Mom? Goddamn
                    Christmas ornaments...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   71.
          
          
          
          And as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from
          the case and tears it to shreds...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie, please...
          
          There's no stopping her now. Red-faced, she lashes out at the
          display case with a devastating kick, the glass SHATTERING...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie, stop this instant!
          
          She continues her rampage regardless, ripping a FIRE EXTINGUISHER
          from the wall and hurling it through another display case...
          
                              MARIE
                    I hate you, Mom!    I'm glad you're dead!
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY PD - NIGHT
          
          Storm clouds gather over the whitewashed Police station...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Elena sits with her head in her hands, across from Kristen in an
          anonymous interview room.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I told you.
          
          Elena looks up, tears streaking her mascara.
          
                              ELENA
                    Told me what?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That if you were telling the truth I'd
                    back you all the way. If you lied to me
                    there'd be trouble...
          
          Elena slumps back down, her head on the table.
          
                              ELENA
                    Chad swerved off the road, I swear...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Just swerved for no reason. Just decided
                    to take a shortcut through the swamp?
          
          Elena sobs, can't look Kristen in the eye.
          
                              ELENA
                    It was an accident...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   72.
          
          
          
          The door to the interview room swings open, and Detective Morrison
          strides through, a fresh-from-the-printer REPORT in his hands...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Accident my ass.
          
          He flips the pages of the report...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Forensics finds the head trauma that
                    killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a
                    single blow from behind.

           lena looks up, through Panda eyes...
          
                              ELENA
                    The crash. He...he hit his head...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Was that before or after you dragged him
                    through the swamp?
          
          Elena has no answers as Morrison takes the cuffs from his belt,
          snaps them on Elena's wrists.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You got the right to remain silent, which
                    in your case is probably best, cos of the
                    shit you come up with...
          
          Kristen stands up, shaking her head.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That's two strikes, Elena. One more and
                    you're out.
          
          Elena looks at her pleadingly.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll do whatever you want.
          
          Kristen stops. Thinks for a moment. Nods to Morrison as he drags
          Elena to her feet.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Yeah. Yeah you will.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you
                    what happened. She killed him, and took
                    the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie
                    Clifford...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   73.
          
          
          
          Morrison just sneers.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Keep bleeting, Missy. All the way to the
                    Judge. I think its time he heard the
                    truth about Jay Clifford's accuser.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be
                    cleared, you know that. You need Marie,
                    you need the proof they set him up...
          
          Morrison considers this.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You came so close to nailing the Black
                    Widow, don't let this slip through your
                    fingers, Detective...
          
          He's about to speak, when Elena's cell phone rings. Kristen takes
          it from Elena, looks at the CALLER ID, sees Marie's name...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Speak of the Devil...
          
          She holds the phone up.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're gonna answer it. And you're gonna
                    say that everything went fine. No one
                    found Chad's body. The plan's still on.
                    Do you understand me?
          
          Elena nods slowly. Morrison turns to Kristen.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You thinking what I'm thinking?
          K
           risten's patient with him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    This is your chance. Feds can't take this
                    one from you...
          
          Morrison weighs his options, then finally nods.
          
          Kristen clicks the phone ON, holds it to Elena's ear.
          
                               ELENA
                    Yello...

          INT. MARIE'S BMW - NIGHT
          
          Marie speeds wildly down the deserted Blue Bay streets, one
          trembling hand holding a cigarette, the other her cellphone.
          
                               MARIE (ON PHONE)
                    The diamonds are fakes. Totally
                    worthless.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    No. That can't be true!
          
                              MARIE
                    Believe it. I'm leaving. Tonight.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    You can't...what about...me...
          
          Marie takes a long drag from her cigarette.
          
                              MARIE
                    Don't you understand? There's no money.
                    Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero. How am I
                    supposed to take care of your broke ass?
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kristen is listening in on the whole conversation. She cups her
          hand over the phone, whispers to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Tell her she has to meet you. Tell her
                    she can't leave...
          
          Elena nods and Kristen puts the phone back to her lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    I...I gotta see you.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    I'll send you a photo.
          
                              ELENA
                    Please. Just one last time.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    I'm gone, gone, gonski.
          
          Elena's reeling. Kristen motions for her to continue.
          
                              ELENA
                    I think maybe...maybe there's a way we
                    could still get some money...

          INT. MARIE'S BMW - NIGHT
          
          Marie considers this for a long moment.    Finally...
          
                              MARIE
                    Okay, talk...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    Not over the phone. We gotta meet.

                              KRISTEN
                    Where'd you keep the wire taps?

          He tosses her his electronic keycard...

          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
          
          The Blue Bay High pool is illuminated in the dead of night,
          casting blue ripples over the bleachers where Elena waits
          nervously. She can't help but fiddle with the wire hidden beneath
          her shirt...
          
                              ELENA
                        (whispering)

          INT. MORRISON'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Morrison listens nervously to Elena's tinny voice coming in
          through the speaker...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    Is this thing working?
          
          The Detective shoots Kristen a concerned look.
          
                              MORRISON

          Elena adjusts the mic taped to her chest, wincing as the tape
          pulls her delicate skin.
          
                              ELENA
                    I..don't think I can do this...
          
                              MARIE (O.S.)
                    It's already done.
          
          Elena looks up guiltily. Marie is standing by the side of the
          pool. How much did she see?
          
                              MARIE
                    So?
          
          The word's stick in Elena's throat...
          
                              ELENA
                    I had no choice...
          
                              MARIE
                    Blah, blah, blah. Get over it. He's dead.
                    Now you told me you had a plan. Spit it
                    out.
          
                              ELENA
                    Jay's got cash. At the building site. I
                    saw it.
          
          Marie rolls her eyes.
          
                              MARIE
                    That's your brilliant plan? It's in a
                    safe, dumb ass. You a safecracker? Have
                    you got magic fingers, gonna pick that
                    lock? I don't think so. Next.

          Kristen winces as she listens to the girls' conversation.

                                LENA (V.O.)
                         (through the speakers)
                    We're gonna go to Jay. Tell him what we
                    did.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Like hell we are.

          Elena walks down the bleachers, approaching a skeptical Marie.
          
                              ELENA
                    Listen to me. We go to the jail, tell him
                    we'll come clean, tell the police
                    everything, if he gives us the
                    combination. I'm still a minor, they'll
                    send me back to Juvie. Shit, I could do
                    that time standing on my head...
          
          Marie's wavering.
          
                              MARIE
                    How much money?
          
          Elena reaches Marie, puts her hands on her hips.
          
                              ELENA
                    Enough for you and me.
          
          Grinds against her. Slowly, sensually.
          
                              MARIE
                    We don't have to tell the cops anything.
                    We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking.
          
                              ELENA
                    But, we got rid of the real one...
          
                              MARIE
                    I kept a copy. Never trusted you
                    backstabbers.
          
          Elena tries to pull away, but Marie drags her back until their
          faces are inches apart.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're trembling.
          
          There's no denying it. Marie slowly draws her hand down Elena's
          face, down her neck, to her chest. So close to the wire. Finally
          places her palm over Elena's heart...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie, I...
          
                                 MARIE
                    Ssshhhh...
          
          BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...

          to breath...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Elena and Marie stand there for what seems like an eternity,
          unblinking...
          B
           OOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...
          
          Finally Marie smiles...
          
                              MARIE
                    Alright. Let's do it...
          
          INT. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT
          
          Jay laughs, as he sits across from Marie and Elena, separated by
          an inch of bullet proof glass. Theo stands by the door.
          
                              JAY
                    Well, well, well. Who'd have thought.
                    What a pleasant surprise. I guess you
                    guys have kissed and made up?
          
                              MARIE
                    Very funny. Did you know the diamonds
                    were fakes?
          
          Jay nods slowly.
          
                              JAY
                    Your Mom hocked them years ago. Boozed it
                    all away. You already know the end of her
                    sorry story...
          
          Marie's jaw tightens. Jay leans back.
          
                              JAY
                    So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
          
                              MARIE
                    We want money. Whatever you've got in
                    your safe at the beach condos.
          
          Jay bursts out laughing again.
          
                              JAY
                    Of course you do. Of course you do.
          
                                                          03/22/2004    79.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    We'll get you out of here...
          
          Jay stops laughing, leans back in to the inch thick glass.
          
                                 JAY
                    You will?
          
          Marie holds up a DIGITAL VIDEO TAPE...
          
                              JAY
                    Is that what I think it is?
          
                              MARIE
                    You give us the combination and this goes
                    in the nearest mail box, tied with a
                    pretty pink bow.
          
                              JAY
                    How do I know it's the real tape?
          
                              MARIE
                    You're gonna have to trust us.
          
                              JAY
                    I've been down that road before.
          
          Marie opens the cassette housing, ready to rip the tape apart...
          
                              MARIE
                    This is non-negotiable.
          
          Theo interjects...
          
                              THEO
                    Sir, we have no grounds for appeal. This
                    could be our only chance.
          
                              MARIE
                    What's the combination?
          
          The tortured screams of inmates echo in Jay's ears.
          
                                 JAY
                    I can't...
          
                              MARIE
                    No such word as 'can't'...
          
          A PRISON GUARD puts a massive hand on Jay's shoulder...

          Jay sighs...

          Marie shakes her head.
          
                               MARIE
                    The combination's the day Mom died, you
                    sick fuck?
          
          Jay's led away in shackles...

          Marie's BMW flies down the deserted Blue Bay streets, blasting
          through red lights.
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie handles the car like a Formula One driver, and with twice
          the intensity. The G-force pins Elena back against the seat.
          
                                 ELENA
                    Slow down!
          
          Marie steps on the gas.
          
                              ELENA
                    We're in a world of shit!
          
          Marie steps on the gas.
          
                              ELENA
                    We'll never get away with this. You know
                    that don't you?
          
          Marie steps on the gas. She ain't saying a word, and time's
          running out for Elena...
          
          INT. MORRISON'S POLICE CAR - NIGHT
          
          Morrison struggles to keep up with Marie's Bullit-esque driving.
          Kristen stays focused on the one-sided conversation in her
          headphones...
          
                              KRISTEN

          Marie's BMW screeches to a stop outside the beachfront condos, and
          Marie strides towards the construction site entrance.
          
          Elena gets out the car, feeling decidedly sick. She circuitously
          adjusts the microphone taped to her chest, then follows Marie into
          the dark, unfinished building
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Marie enters the makeshift office like a wolf stalking her prey,
          heading straight for the safe. With a rock steady hand, she works
          the lock...CLICK...

          it nimbly between her buffed nails. CLICK...
          
                                MARIE
                    Two down.
          
          Elena stands in the makeshift office doorway, trying to coax
          something incriminating from Marie's perfect lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    I told you not to kill Chad. I'll tell it
                    to the police.
          
          Marie doesn't even look round, concentrating on the job at hand.
          Elena's reeling.

                    stepfather raping me, made me perjure
                    myself on the stand, went and killed
                    Chad, and now...

                    99. A very good year...
          
          CLICK. Third and final tumbler falls. The safe door swings open,
          revealing a STACK of CASH and Jay's HANDGUN...
          
          INT. MORRISON'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kristen shakes her head. It's hopeless, Elena can't get Marie to
          say an incriminating word...
          
                              MORRISON
                    This has gotta end.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It's gonna end. One way or another...
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Marie pulls out a wad of crisp, clean bills, draws them across her
          nose like a wine connoisseur.
          
                              MARIE
                    Money. Always in style.
          
          She dances over to Elena, waves the cash in her face.
          
                              ELENA
                    Why'd you do it? Why'd Chad have to die?
          
          Marie slides up against Elena, fluttering the cash over her in the
          world's most expensive shower. Elena couldn't be less interested,
          focused on getting that confession...
          
                              ELENA
                    You killed him, Marie. You murdered him
                    in cold blood...
          
          Marie presses up against Elena, pushing her up against the
          unfinished dry wall. Kisses her passionately, finally silencing
          her for a few, brief, electric seconds. And when she pulls away
          her fingers dance down Elena's shirt until...
          S
           he rips the microphone from Elena's chest. Stands there with the
          dangling cord in her hands, her face caught in a permanent snarl.
          The blood drains from Elena's face...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   83.
          
          
          
          INT. MORRISON'S POLICE CAR - NIGHT
          
          A piercing feedback forces Kristen to throw aside the headphones.
          She looks to Morrison.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    She's been made...
          
          Morrison draws his gun.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Stay here...
          
          Kristen shakes her head resolutely.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I got us into this...
          
          BANG! A GUNSHOT echoes in the darkness...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Just stay in the car! Please...
          
          Morrison sprints over to the building site, leaving Kristen in the
          car, alone.
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Elena stands with her hands up, an ugly bullet hole in the wall
          just beside her. Marie keeps Jay's gun trained on her as she
          unloads the cash from the safe...
          
                              MARIE
                    You stupid fucking Sherbert. You think
                    you could sell me out?
          
                              ELENA
                    They made me do it...
          
                              MARIE
                    Morrison doesn't know his prick from a
                    pogo stick. And that bitch Parole
                    Officer, she hasn't got the balls for
                    this...
          
          Marie takes dead aim once more...
          
                              ELENA
                    Please, don't...
          
          Marie's finger tightens on the trigger...
          
          INT. MORRISON'S POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          BOOM!
          
          Kristen tenses as the gunshot echoes throughout the construction
          site. She reaches across to the driver's seat, grabs the
          SHOTGUN...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elena scrambles across the concrete floor, desperately trying to
          make it to the relative safety of one of the support pillars. She
          sees the forensic UV light switch on the floor, reaches for it...
          
          MARIE
          
          stands in the shattered doorway, surveys the expansive, unfinished
          floor. Is about to unleash a hail of bullets when...
          
          The WORK LIGHTS flicker out, replaced by the eerie ULTRA VIOLET
          LIGHTS scattered around the unfinished floor...Bathed in the
          florescent blue glow of the lights, Elena scrambles to safety
          behind a pillar. Her shirt GLOWS, her eyes like beacons...
          
          MORRISON                                                             
          Sweeps through the second floor, meticulously checking every         
          corner, every shadow...                                              
          KRISTEN                                                              
          Runs towards the unfinished building, looking up to the UV glow on 
          the fourth floor. She sprints for the INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR...       
          MARIE
          
          scours the bizarre darkness, hears a sound. BOOM! The orange
          muzzle flash illuminates the floor briefly as Marie shoots
          randomly. The flimsy plaster walls EXPLODE...
          
          MORRISON                                                             
          Enters the third floor from the fire escape, continues his           
          meticulous sweep of the building.                                    
          KRISTEN
          
          Stands in the industrial elevator, jabbing the 4th floor button,  
          hyperventilating as more gunshots EXPLODE. She clutches Morrison's 
          shotgun to her chest, getting closer to the top floor.             
          ELENA
          
          shields herself as plaster rains down on her, unable to see
          through the cloud of dust under the UV lights, until...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   85.
          
          
          
          BOOM! A bullet sparks off rebar inches from her foot. She looks up
          to see the barrel of Jay's gun. Marie's face is contorted
          maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger...                  
          MORRISON
          
          Runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening GUN SHOT
          rings out. Followed by SCREAMS. He rips open the fourth floor fire 
          door, tearing through the building, pushing through thick plastic
          sheeting until he finds himself under the UV glow.
          T
           hick plumes of blood, black under the UV light, stain the walls
          and floor. He sees Elena, in a fetal ball, trembling
          uncontrollably.
          
          Beside her, Marie lies dead, her chest a gaping crimson mess,
          Jay's gun still clutched tightly in her cold, dead hands.
          
          Kristen looks up at him, almost too shocked to speak.   Morrison's
          shotgun is still smoking in her hands.
          
                               KRISTEN
                     I didn't have a choice. She was gonna
                     kill Elena.
          
          Morrison steps forward, calmly, takes the gun from her.
          
                               MORRISON
                     It's gonna be okay.
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - LATER
          
          The new crime scene is alive with activity. Cops, reporters,
          bystanders. Morrison sips coffee as PARAMEDICS wheel Marie's
          corpse to the ambulance.
          
          One of them hands something to Morrison. A blood-splattered
          digital video tape.
          
                               PARAMEDIC
                     We found this on the body.
          
          Morrison takes it without a word...
          
                               KRISTEN (O.S.)
                     Just got off the phone with the Parole
                     board...
          
          Morrison turns around, sees Kristen approaching, still visibly
          shaken.
          
          K

                              KRISTEN
                    They want me to bring Elena back to Miami
                    in the morning.
          
          She hesitates...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I'm... sorry for this whole mess.
          
          Morrison considers this, picks his words carefully.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Don't be. It was my gun that fired the
                    shots, so it must've been me who pulled
                    the trigger. I'll take the credit on this
                    one. After all the Black widow crap I had
                    to put up with, I've earnt it...
          
          Kristen nods.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You did the right thing...
          
                              MORRISON
                    We did the right thing.
          
           risten smiles, almost, moves in, and wraps her arms around the
          Detective. He closes his eyes, savors the moment. As she pulls
          away, she hands him a card.
                               K
                               RISTEN
                    You call me, promise?
          
          Morrison beams.
          
                              MORRISON
                    I will. I will.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Now that this is all over, maybe we can
                    have that drink soon...
          
          She leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips. Morrison watches her
          walk away. In spite of all the shit that's gone down, he's
          probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of Blue Bay.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          EXT. COUNTY JAIL - MORNING
          
          Morrison's unmarked Sedan idles outside the barbed wire fences of
          the County Jail. The gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed Jay
          Clifford outside, wincing from the bright sunlight.
          
                                                              03/22/2004   87.
          
          
          
          Morrison gets out of the car, meets Jay.
          
                                MORRISON
                      How you holdin' up, Jay?
          
                                JAY
                      Been better.
          
          He sure has.
          
                                MORRISON
                      So what's next?
          
                                JAY
                      No idea. Everything's gone. Repossessed.
                      Guess there's nowhere to go but up.
          
          It's all he can do to keep from breaking down.
          
                                MORRISON
                      I can't help but feel partially
                      responsible. If there's anything I...
          
          Jay shakes his head.
          
                                JAY
                      I don't think so, but thanks.
          
                                MORRISON
                      Can I at least give you a ride somewhere?
          
                                JAY
                      Ain't got nowhere to go...
          
          Morrison watches sadly as Jay stumbles past him, walking to
          nowhere in particular.
          
                                MORRISON
                          (hopeful)
                      ... but up, right?
          
          No reply.
          
          The Detective heads back to his car, stops for a second, reaches
          into his pocket and pulls out Kristen's already-dog eared card. He
          can't resist. Dials the number After four rings there's no
          message. Just a BEEP.
          
                                MORRISON
                          (into phone)
                      Uh, Kristen, it's Michael again. Haven't
                      heard from you. Hope you're doing okay.
                      Everything's fine here.

                              MORRISON(CONT'D)
                    Haven't been any questions asked that I
                    can't answer, an' no one's brought your
                    name up. So give me a call back and maybe
                    we can go for that drink...

                              RECORDED VOICE
                    BEEP. The mail box you are trying to
                    reach is full. Your message has been
                    deleted.
          
          Morrison's disconnected. Puzzled, he gets into his car.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD - DAY
          
          Morrison gets the shock of his life when he enters the usually
          quiet police station and finds himself in the midst of utter
          pandemonium.
          
          Federal Officers are everywhere.
          
          He tries to pick his way through the crowd when he's intercepted
          by Officer Entwistle.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    You better come with me, Detective.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD - MORRISON'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Entwistle leads Morrison into his office, where Agent Dammers sits
          behind his desk.
          
                              AGENT DAMMERS
                    Detective Morrison. So good to finally
                    see you.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What the hell, Dammers?
          
                              AGENT DAMMERS
                    I should be asking you the same question.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
          
          Morrison stands in the middle of the evidence locker, dumbfounded.
          Dammers watches him, his arms crossed.
          
                              MORRISON
                    It's...gone.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    That's right, Morrison. Every last bit of
                    evidence from the Black Widow case.
          
                                                               03/22/2004   89.
                              DAMMERS(CONT'D)
                    Not to mention the money you confiscated.
                    All $427,000.                                                 
                                 MORRISON
                    But how...
          
                              DAMMERS
                    I was hoping you'd be able to answer that
                    question.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What in God's name are you talking about?
                    I didn't have anything to do with it!
          
                              DAMMERS
                    Well, your key card was the last one that
                    opened this locker.
          
          Morrison's heart is beating a mile a minute.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Holy shit. Kristen...

          A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST sits behind a sparse desk when the phone
          rings.
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST

          INT. BLUE BAY PD EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
          
          Morrison paces back and forth, on the phone, as Dammers watches,
          not saying a word...
          
                              MORRISON
                        (into phone)
                    This is Detective Morrison, Blue Bay PD.
                    I was wondering if you had a forwarding
                    number for Kristen Richards...
          
                                 PRETTY RECEPTIONIST(V.O.)
                    Who?
          
                              MORRISON
                    Kristen Richards. She's one of your
                    officers. Has cases up here in Blue Bay.

          The receptionist's fingers nimbly dance across the keyboard in
          front of her.
          
                                                                       90.
          
          
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
                    I'm sorry, Detective. There's no one here
                    by that name.
          
                              MORRISON
                    No, of course there is. I worked with her
                    personally. I...
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
                    I have no record of a Kristen Richards
                    ever working here. Besides, Blue Bay's
                    out of our jurisdiction...
          
          INT. EVIDENCE LOCKER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Morrison struggles to control his emotions...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Oh no. No, no, no...
          
          EXT. PARADISE - DAY
          
          Soft waves lap against a pristine beach. Palm trees sway in the
          warm breeze. A steady WHIRRING is the only sound that disturbs the
          serenity. Is it a lawn mower? A leaf blower?
          
          There's a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this
          idyllic scene. The swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical
          Caribbean Sunlight.
          
          And stretched out on a recliner in the sheerest of bikinis is none
          other than Kristen Richards, soaking up rays.
          
          At her side is a PAPER SHREDDER, and between sips from a piña
          colada, she feeds document after document, each one stamped BLACK
          WIDOW EVIDENCE in red ink...
          
          Kristen looks over at Elena, equally stunning in a matching
          bikini.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I can't believe Morrison just handed me
                    the key to the evidence locker...
          
          A broad grin stretches across her lips as Elena empties the
          contents of a velvet pouch onto a table.
          T
           he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    These are...genuine?
          
          Elena nods.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   91.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Nothin' like the real thing. Switched
                    'em for the fakes right after Marie tried
                    to pay me off...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    They're...So beautiful.
          
          Elena picks up the bigger diamond, hands it to Kristen.
          
                              ELENA
                    The mother.
          
          Kristen picks up the smaller diamond, hands it to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    The daughter.
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY
          
          Morrison paces the infamous crime scene, at wit's end. Dammers
          stands off to the side, just watching him with a bemused look
          etched across his face.
          
                              MORRISON
                    She was the Black Widow. Her and that
                    little...
          
          He tries to think of an appropriate slur for Elena. Can't come up
          with anything, continues pacing frantically.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Played me like a fool.
          
          Dammers shrugs.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    Hind sight's 20-20. No need to be so hard
                    on yourself, Morrison...
                        (beat, smile)
                    That's my job.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You smug son of a bitch. It's not like
                    you knew who she was anymore than I did.
          
          Dammers nods slowly.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    That's the God's honest truth. But at
                    least I didn't give her my evidence
                    locker keycard.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   92.
                              DAMMERS(CONT'D)
                    And I didn't lie about who fired the
                    shots that killed the Clifford kid.
          
          Morrison's heart sinks. He looks like he's going to faint.
          Steadies himself, placing both hands against the wall, just as Jay
          did that fateful night seemingly a lifetime ago...
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY
          
          Dammers leads Morrison to his awaiting car. They pass MR. Barajas
          and Cicatriz. Mr. Barajas is in his usual foul mood...
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    Un pinche sink hole! No lo puedo creer!
          
          Morrison stops, regards Barajas...
          
                              MORRISON
                    What did you say?
          
                               CICATRIZ
                    The foundation is sinking. The entire
                    site is a sink hole. It's completely
                    worthless.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    I'm going to kill Jay Clifford...
          
                              MORRISON
                    You and me both...
          
          EXT. PARADISE - DAY
          
          Elena and Kristen lay side-by-side on loungers, soaking in the
          sun, when a voice rouses them...
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    Poor Detective Morrison. It's hard to do
                    that to a friend. Especially one going
                    through such a nasty divorce.
          
          They look up to see Jay, standing before them in a pair of
          colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini...
          
                              JAY
                    Told me he'd never trust another woman as
                    long as he lived. And then along came a
                    spider...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    A black widow.
          
          Jay glances at Elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink.
          
                                                         03/22/2004   93.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                                                                               
                    More like widows... Gotta say I was a
                    little taken aback when you wanted to                      
                    snuff Marie, but you know what, I'm over                   
                                                                               
                    the bitch...
          
          Elena suddenly gets to her feet.
          
                              ELENA
                    You want me to top you off?
          
                              JAY
                    That'd be fine, just fine.
          
          He hands Elena his empty glass, then kisses Kristen tenderly.
          When they break...
          
                              JAY
                    She's got a good head on her shoulders.
          
          Kristen doesn't reply. Just smiles, watches Elena over by the
          outside bar, mixing Jay's drink...
          
                              JAY
                    You two got me out of a mountain of shit,
                    I'll tell you that. Craziest Goddamn
                    scheme I've ever heard of. But hell, you
                    played it perfectly.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    My job was easy. It was Elena who had to
                    keep it all together...
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    We've had some practice along the way...
          
          Jay turns around, smiles at Elena as she holds out his drink.
          
                              ELENA
                    Here you go, Mr. Clifford.
          
          Jay takes it from her appreciatively, sips at it as he sidles off
          to the swimming pool.
          
                              JAY
                    Well, all that nasty business, it's
                    behind us. Forever. From here on out,
                    it's the good life.
          
          He starts to climb the high dive. When he gets to the top, he
          looks down at Elena and Kristen, smiles.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   94.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    You two look so good, it's difficult to
                    tell which one's the mother and which
                    one's the daughter...
          
          Kristen calls back up at him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That's just the roofies talking...
          
          Says it so sweetly, it takes a moment for Jay to register the
          sinister implications...
          
                              JAY
                    What did you say?
          
          His eyes are blood shot. He starts to sway atop the high dive.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Delta Chi, class of '88. Hellova party.
                    I'd never really tasted cocktails like
                    that.
          
          Jay's swaying uneasily on the high dive platform...
          
                              JAY
                    I don't...whattya talking about?
          
                               KRISTEN
                    It was like being awake though an
                    operation. I could feel everything
                    happening, but I couldn't do anything to
                    stop it...
          
                              JAY
                    Oh...shit...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You took something from me that night.
                    But you left something behind...
          
          Jay's head is spinning as he looks to Kristen, to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Your daughter...
          
          He can't quite get his mind around it. Everything's becoming
          blurry.
          
                              JAY
                    I don't remember...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   95.
          
          
          
          He looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before
          it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below,
          shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds...
          E
           lena and Kristen stand side-by-side below him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You may not remember...
          
          A broad grin stretches across Elena's lips as she finishes...
          
                              ELENA
                    ...But you'll never forget.
          
          Jay tries to take a step forward. He stumbles. Tries in vain to
          regain his balance. It's too late. He falls. 20 feet to the
          unyielding concrete, exploding like a paper bag filled with
          vegetable soup...
          
                              ELENA
                    Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing.
          
          They stand back, watching Jay's pancaked body draining its
          precious blood into the ice blue pool...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Let's go get our money.
          
          They gather the diamonds, walk away as the pool turns crimson
          red...
          
          THE END
          
          As the credits roll....
          
          INT. OFFICE - MORNING
          
          An anonymous, luxurious office. A fat, balding, semi-conscious MAN
          lies curled up on the floor as Elena, half undressed and wearing a
          black wig, shovels cash into her oversized purse...
          
          There's a crackle on her WALKIE-TALKIE...
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    We got problems...
          
          From outside, she can hear the wailing of SIRENS. Getting closer.
          
                              ELENA
                    Almost done here.
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    Leave it. Come on!
          
                                                                       96.
          
          
          
          Elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her
          pocket for good measure.
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    He gonna be able to make an ID?
          
          Elena glances at the Man on the floor, his puffy eyes glazed over
          like a jelly donut.
          
                              ELENA
                    Not on your life. I gave him enough
                    roofies to make an elephant forget.
          
          EXT. OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Elena gets into a waiting car outside the bank. The getaway
          driver...Kristen, of course...
          
                              ELENA
                    I can't believe we just gave up all that
                    cash.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Forget it. The Black Widow's finally got                   
                    an angle on our real prey.  
                                         
                              ELENA                                            
                    We goin' to Blue Bay?  
                                              
                              KRISTEN                                          
                    He won't know what hit him.       
                                   
          A smile crosses Elena's perfect lips...    
                                    
                              ELENA                                            
                    'bout time...        
                                                
          And the car pulls away from the curb just seconds before a fleet
          of police cars screeches to a halt in front of the bank.
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - JAY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Jay carefully places the stacks of cash into the wall safe in his
          unfinished office.
          
                              KRISTEN (O.S.)
                    That's an awful lot of money...
          
          Jay spins round, flabbergasted that someone's watching him.
          
                              JAY
                    Who the hell...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   97.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Not enough though. Gonna need those
                    Diamonds if you're gonna ride out this
                    disaster...
          
                              JAY
                    What? What the hell do you mean?
          
          Kristen calmly reaches into her purse, pulls out a handful of
          marbles. Throws them onto the ground, letting them roll towards
          B
          Jay...
          
           ut they stop, change direction, all coming rolling back in a
          small circle, until they come to rest in the middle of the
          concrete floor...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    The building's built on a sink hole, Jay.
                    You know it, and I know it. Gonna need to
                    think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans
                    off your back...
          
          Jay's tiny mind can't take it all in.
          
                              JAY
                    How'd you...how'd you know all this...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It's what we do.
          
                              JAY
                    We?
          
          Elena walks seductively into the unfinished office. It's on.
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
          
          Marie sits in the bleachers by the side of the school dive pool,
          looking at her Mother's soon-to-be-diamond ring through teary
          eyes...
          
                              MARIE
                    I just want what's mine...
          
          Elena stalks the bleachers behind her.
          
                              ELENA
                    The diamonds are your inheritance. You
                    deserve them...
          
                              MARIE
                    My fucking Step-Monster'll never give me
                    the Goddamn key...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   98.
          
          
          
          Elena jumps down the bleachers, sits down next to Marie.
          
                              ELENA
                    So you take it, one way or another...
          
          INT. CHAD'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Behind closed doors, Chad's completing yet another dubious
          transaction, handing over a bag of roofies. The buyer this
          time...Marie...
          
                              MARIE
                    You take a check?
          
                              CHAD
                    Money talks, bullshit walks. I got
                    strippers to feed...
          
          Marie fishes out the money from her purse.
          
                              MARIE
                    How'd you like to make some real cash?
          
                              CHAD
                    Chad likes the sound of that.
          
          And it's that simple...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Chad uses Jay's teeth mouldings to bite Elena, as Marie trains
          Jay's video camera on her, wailing on her in a drunken stupor.
          
                              ELENA
                    Hey, that hurt!
          
                              MARIE
                    Shut it, bitch. No pain, no gain...
          
          Elena's face is pressed against the concrete wall...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT
          
          Chad sits at his video console, all alone, expertly manipulating
          the audio and video footage.
          
                              CHAD
                    We'll put you right here, and...
          
          Chad presses play. On the video screen a frightened Elena is
          huddled against the wall.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   99.
          
          
          
                              JAY (V.O.)
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Elena watches as Marie and Theo drive away, then turns to the
          glistening Mother Daughter diamonds. She opens a case with two
          identical GLASS REPLICAS, and replaces the diamonds...
          
          All the while, Uncle Marty SNORES his head off...
          
                              ELENA
                        (to Uncle Marty, irritated)
                    Will you knock that off? They're gone.
          
          Uncle Marty's eyes snap open.
          
          EXT. BEACH PARADISE - DAY
          
          Kristen and Marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach
          when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their
          sizzling bodies.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're blocking our sun...
          
          Looks over her sunglasses at...Uncle Marty...Only all cleaned up,
          in a pair of Bermuda shorts that show off his milky white legs...
          He clutches a briefcase...
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Ladies. Hellova job back there. Your best
                    ever if I might be so bold...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    This is our biggest score. You sure you
                    can move it?
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Not a problem.
          
          Kristen nods to the briefcase in Uncle Marty's hand.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Let's see the green...
          
          Uncle Marty lays the case down on the lounger, opens it, revealing
          stacks of cash...
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Got another lead, if you're interested.
                    Was just up in Boston, surveying a
                    mansion that's just been sold.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   100.
                                 UNCLE MARTY(CONT'D)
                       Termites already eaten most of it.
                       Owner's shitting bricks. There's gotta be
                       an angle for the Black Widows...
          
          Kristen and Elena look to each other.
          
                                 KRISTEN
                       It's over. We had a good run.
          
          Uncle Marty shrugs.
          
                                 UNCLE MARTY
                       Shame. Guess all good things come to an
                       end. So, the diamonds...
          
          Elena reaches down, pulls the diamonds from the sand. Hands them
          over and is about to take the case of money when...
          
                                 UNCLE MARTY
                       How do I know these are the real thing?
          
          Elena looks to Kristen. They smile.
          
                                 ELENA
                       You're going to have to trust us...
          
          Like fuck.
          
          THE END. AGAIN.

          EXT. WATCHUNG RESERVATION - DAWN.
                         
          It's a bitter cold January morning. The woods are quiet.
          Desolate. In the far off distance a man is jogging. He banks
          around the end of a small pond and runs right at us. This is
          MIKE FLAHERTY, FORTY-TWO. He is running hard. Or at least as
          hard as he can.
                         
          Suddenly TWO JOGGERS blow past him.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME.
                         
          A HOME MADE STAIN GLASS ANGEL hangs on a window. It falls to
          the ground.
                         
          ABBY FLAHERTY, SIX-YEARS OLD, stirs and gets out of her bed
          out. She picks up the Bird and inspects it. It's broken.
                         
                          ABBY
           Shit.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER.
                         
          JACKIE FLAHERTY, THIRTY-SEVEN is still sleeping. Abby walks
          into the room. Jackie opens her eyes.
                         
                          ABBY
                          (WHISPERS)
           Mommy, can we play croquet today?
                         
          Jackie lifts Abby onto the bed.
                         
                          ABBY (CONT'D)

          STELLA, TWO YEARS OLD is standing up in her crib crying. Mike
          comes in and picks her up.
                         
                          MIKE

          Jackie prepares some food. She knocks a glass over into the
          sink and it breaks.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Shit.
                         
          She looks over at Abby who is immersed in her coloring. Then
          she sets the food down in front of Stella who is sitting in a
          high chair. Mike enters wearing a suit and tie.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)
           How was the run?
                         
                         
                          MIKE JACKIE
          Good. It was good. Abby, finish your cereal.

           I'm very impressed with you keeping
           it up.
                         
          Mike shrugs and takes a yogurt from the refrigerator.
                         
                          ABBY
           I don't like it.
                         
                          JACKIE
           You do too, so stop drawing and
           eat.
                         
                          MIKE ABBY
          What brand is this? Daddy, look. It's your team.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)
           They're all the same.
                         
          Mike looks at the drawing. It looks nothing like a team.
                         
                          MIKE
           That's my team? That's great,
           honey. Are they winning?

          Abby knocks over a glass of water. It spills onto the
          drawing.

           It's a bad word.
                         
          Off Mike's look.

           Uh huh. Bye sweetie.
                         
          He kisses Abby.

          Mike walks outside toward his car. He opens the car door.

           Mike?
                         
          Mike turns. Jackie is standing at the door.

           Please do. I don't want it coming
           down on the house.
                         
          Mike looks at a VERY DEAD TREE in the side yard.
                         
                          MIKE

          Jackie shuts the door. Mike looks up at the tree.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)

          Mike pays for his coffee and bagel and starts to leave. He
          nods to a group of FIVE OLD MEN who wave him over. He tries
          to keep moving but they continue to engage him. Finally he
          joins the table. The group shares a laugh.

          Mike's car pulls into a driveway of an OLD HOUSE that has
          been converted into TWO OFFICES.
                         
          A SIGN on the lawn reads: "MICHAEL S. FLAHERTY, COUNSELOR AT

          Mike parks his car as a WORKMAN walks up from the basement of
          the house and gets into his VAN and pulls away.
                         
          Mike gets out of his car and walks toward the back door
          carrying his briefcase. He stops at the basement steps.

          It's an old, musty basement filled with endless shelves of
          files.
                         
                          MIKE

          STEPHEN VIGMAN, FIFTY, emerges carrying some files.

                          VIGMAN
           Oh, that sucks more. He's the
           plumber. I called him to look at

           Well it is but he took one look at

           before it blows.

           Well Leo, remember you got lost and
           the police had to help you a few
           times. That's why we brought Jolie
           into help you, right?
                         
                          LEO

                          LEO
           That's crazy. I don't need New

           there's no funny business between

           Right. I'm sure there's not. Let's

           They could but they never will.
           It's too much work. They'll
           probably move him into Oak Knoll.
           Hand me one of their brochures?

                          MIKE
           No, she can't. His guardian still
           has to make every single decision.

           No! I'm not having a heart attack!
           I just...can't breathe...

           That could be a heart attack, Mike.
           You should lie down.
                         
          Terry tries to help him but it's only seems to annoy Mike.

          Thatcher is turning up the heat. He obviously wants Poplar.
          Mike is starting to feel it.

          Mike looks back at Leo who is trying to unscrew the cap on
          his water bottle, completely uninterested in the proceedings.
          He makes a decision.
                         
                          MIKE
           Your Honor, Leo told me he wants
           to live at home. He has the money
           to do that and I want to make sure
           that happens. If the State can do
           that then fine.
                         
                          THATCHER
           Counsel knows we can't do that,

          Mike looks to Shelly who just shrugs.
                         
                          MIKE
           Uh...yeah...OK. You know where it

           OK, yeah. Just stay there and I'll
           pick you up at about three.

           OK.
                         
          Kyle shuts the door. Mike looks at Shelly.

          Kyle is sitting in the corner watching. Mike is standing and
          watching. He doesn't like what he sees.
                         
                          MIKE
           Hey, Rew, what are you doing?
           Coach, can you get on Pill.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           Get up, Rew.
                         
          REW gets up and Vigman gets down on the other wrestler, PILL.

           Everyone watch because none of you
           are doing it right. You want to put
           your chest into his side.
                         
          Vig does it but he's a bit off.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           Just slide back a bit, Vig. A bit
           more. Yeah. Right there. Then you
           give him your full weight. Go ahead
           Vig.
                         
          Vig does. Pill starts to buckle. Vig is big.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           Then you ride the crotch and break
           him down with a cross-face.
                         
          Vigman grabs Pill under the crotch, applies a stiff cross-
          face and then drives him hard to the mat. Another Wrestler,
          STEMLER chimes in. Stemler is wearing a STAR WARS t-shirt.
                         
                          STEMLER
           Oh man, how'd that feel, Pill?
           We'll just call you "pancake"!
                         
          Stemler's a bit off.

           Shut up, Chewbaka.

          He moves well. Fluidly. Carlos keeps trying to grab Kyle's
          ankle but Kyle easily defends against it. Mike checks his
          watch. Then blows his whistle.

          down to the mat.
                         
          Carlos looks shocked. Kyle pops back up but stays focused on
          Carlos. Mike looks to Vigman who raises an eyebrow,

           I know. He finished second at the
           states. In Ohio!
                         
          Mike walks into the kitchen and grabs a beer.

           This kid had seventeen pins. He's a
           killer.
                         
                          MIKE
           I know. It's nuts. And he quit
           after his freshman year.
                         
                          TERRY
           Why?
                         
                          MIKE
           I don't know. He doesn't talk much.
           He's kind of a weird kid. Why
           can't I have one kid like that on
           my team? Just one.

           What're you talking about? You do.
           You have him. You can take this kid
           to the states, Mike.
                         
                          MIKE
           He's not on the team, Ter. He's not
           even a student. He's been here for
           three days.
                         
                          TERRY
           So what? Enroll him!
                         
                          MIKE
           I'm not enrolling him. He's just
           here until we reach his mother and
           figure this out.
                         
                          TERRY
           So he's gotta do something, right?
           Let him wrestle. Look at this way,
           you're helping out the old man and
           this kid's a little bonus for doing
           the right thing.
                         
                          MIKE
           I'm not just helping out the old
           man, Ter. It's not like it's
           charity work. I'm getting paid for
           it.
                         
                          TERRY
           No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but
           think about it, Mike. What are the
           chances that this kid ends up on
           your door step and he can wrestle
           like that? It's a sign, pal.
                         
          This lands with Mike. Terry sits down at his computer.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           Check this out. There's a video
           link of him wrestling in some
           tournament.
                         
          Terry presses play. It's grainy and amateur but good enough.
          Mike looks on.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           Look at that kid.
                         
          Mike gets sucked in.

           Right. I'll take that.

          KYLE's tying his NEW WRESTLING SHOES. The rest of the team is
          sitting around the mat.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           Alright, let's go guys. Wrestle
           off.
                         
                          MIKE
           Vig, you keep time?

          Mike holds up a stop watch.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           Yeah.
                         
                          TERRY
           I'll do it.
                         
          Terry grabs the watch from Mike.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           You don't mind, do you?
                         
                          VIGMAN
           No. Go ahead.
                         
          Mike gives Terry a look. Vig minds. Kyle and JIMMY REED shake
          hands. And set themselves on their marks.
                         
                          VIGMAN (CONT'D)
           Ready? And...wrestle.
                         
          Vigman blows his whistle and the room erupts in cheering.
          Most of it for Jimmy Reed except for Stemler who is rooting
          for Kyle.
                         
          Jimmy and Kyle lock arms but Kyle pushes him away. Jimmy
          locks again but Kyle pushes him away again. Jimmy comes in
          hard this time and Kyle uses his momentum to quickly throw
          him to the ground.
                         
          Jimmy tries to scramble to his knees but Kyle is all over
          him. He quickly locks Jimmy in a cradle and rocks him onto
          his back. It looks easy. Vigman calls the pin. The room is
          quiet...except for Terry.
                         
                          TERRY
           Wow!
                         
          Mike shoots Terry a look. Kyle helps Jimmy off the mat.
                         
                          KYLE
           Good match.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Didn't feel good.
                         
          Vigman turns to Mike and Terry.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           I don't think we can teach him
           anything.

          Mike, Terry, Kyle, Jackie and the kids are eating pizza.
                         
                          TERRY
           I don't know why we didn't quit.
           Just the smell of that room brought
           back the memories. I hated it, it
           was like a form of self-abuse.
                         
                          KYLE
           Were you guys that bad?
                         
                          TERRY
           Mike was average. I sucked. Sorry
           Abby.
                         
                          ABBY
           It's OK.
                         
          Mike checks his watch.
                         
                          MIKE
           I gotta stop by the office and deal
           with the computer. Should I...?
                         
                          JACKIE
           No, I'll take him.
                         
                          TERRY
           We both should have quit. Then we
           could have joined the ski club and
           gotten busy with Allison Shepard on
           the overnights.

                          ABBY
           Who was busy?
                         
                          JACKIE
           Your Uncle Terry is just silly.
                         
                          TERRY
           Sorry Abby. Getting busy is bad.
                         
          Kyle cracks up. Terry catches his eye.

          Terry is sitting in Mike's office. A bottle of scotch and two
          glasses on the desk.
                         
                          KYLE
           Hey, how do you think we'd do
           against Kyle? Now?
                         
           MIKE (O.S.)
           He'd kill us. Both of us. Together.
                         
                          TERRY
           Yeah, you're right. The kid has man
           strength, dude.
                         
          Mike emerges from under the desk.
                         
                          MIKE
           Man strength?
                         
                          TERRY
           Yeah. You know. Not kid strength.
           Man strength.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah...I wouldn't say that around
           the locker room.
                         
                          TERRY

           Just call your IT guy?
                         
                          MIKE
           I don't have an IT guy. IT guys
           cost money.
                         
                          TERRY
           OK. I'm just gonna say what's on my
           mind. I want to be an assistant
           coach too.

           Yeah. Why not? I'm value added.
           Especially compared to Vig.
                         
                          MIKE
           How are you value added?
                         
                          TERRY
           Well first of all I'm fun. No
           denying that. And secondly, unlike
           Vig, I actually used to wrestle.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah, but Ter, you sucked.
                         
                          TERRY
           That doesn't matter, your team
           sucks. Plus I even look more like a
           coach then Vig.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah, that's not really value
           added.
                         
                          TERRY
           Look, Mike, I'm serious here. I
           need some distraction in my life
           right now. All I do is sit in my
           condo and think about Lori and that
           guy having sex in the jacuzzi I
           paid for. It's fucking unhealthy.
           I've been really kind of going
           crazy. Really.
                         
          Mike looks at his friend. He can tell he's serious.
                         
                          MIKE
           We start at 3:30pm. Don't be late.

          Terry raises his glass. Mike toasts.

          Jackie is hanging laundry. She hears a phone ringing from the
          laundry room. She peeks around the corner and sees that Kyle
          is not there. She crosses to his phone and picks it up. It
          reads "Mom". She answers it.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Hello? Hello, this Jackie Flaherty.
           Kyle is staying with us. Hello?
           (She closes the phone)
           I'm gonna kill that lady.
                         
          She sets the phone down and turns. Kyle is standing on the
          stairs. His hair is wet and he's carrying his towel.

          Kyle takes off his shirt and stands on the scale wearing only
          his underwear. He's lean and muscular. He has a TATOO on his
          right arm and PAIR OF WINGS TATOO on his shoulder blades.

          The Pioneers are getting beat. Carlos is wrestling and
          putting up a good fight but time is running out and he's down
          by three points. He tries a desperate takedown but it
          backfires and the other wrestler picks up another two points.
          The buzzer sounds. Match over.
                         
          The team gets up to greet Carlos. Kyle strips off his sweats
          and buckles up his head gear. He walks up to Mike for a pep
          talk.
                         
                          MIKE

           know...be ready out there.
                         
          Terry gives Vigman a look. "Be ready?"

           Uh, OK.
                         
          Mike cuffs Kyle on the side of the head gear.
                         
                          KYLE
           Can you do it harder?
                         
          Mike slaps him hard. And Kyle sprints to the mat and takes
          his stance.
                         
          The Ref blows the whistle and the wrestlers circle each
          other. The OTHER WRESTLER is clearly on the offensive.
                         
                          TERRY

           It's his first match. Give him a
           break.
                         
          The Other Wrestler is relentless. Kyle keeps trying to get up
          and the kid keeps breaking him down. Kyle stands up and Other
          Wrestler slams him to the mat. Kyle is getting beat up.
                         
          The two Wrestlers go out of bounds and the Ref stops the
          action. Kyle gets up and Mike checks in with him.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)

           Good. That's good, right?
                         
          The Ref blows the whistle and Kyle explodes to his feet,
          kicking a leg back between the Other Wrestler's legs. He
          lower's his body, reaches behind him and whips the Other
          Wrestler to the mat.

           That's got nothing to do with luck.
                         
          Kyle shakes the other wrestler's hands and the Ref raises his
          hand in victory. Kyle crosses to the opposing coaches and
          shakes their hands. Then he runs to back to his bench. Mike
          greets him with a handshake.

          Mike smiles and Kyle sits down. The next wrestler, Jimmy
          steps up to Mike.

           all see Kyle the other day? He
           exploded up. Kyle, show the guys
           what you did.
                         
          Kyle is caught off guard. He hesitates
                         
                          KYLE

           Well, it's not a move or anything,
           I just tell myself that the guy on
           top is going to take my head and
           shove it under water and kill me.
           And if I don't want to die on the
           bottom, I just gotta do what ever
           the fuck it takes to get out.
                         
          This kid is intense. His words really land with Mike.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           OK. So the move is called "whatever
           the fuck it takes." Let's go. Let's
           work on it. Come on. "Whatever the

           you kidding me?!
                         
          Kenny Randall looks shocked. He throws off his head gear and
          gets up. The MILBURN COACHES look equally shocked. The Ref
          raises Kyle's hands. Kyle runs over to shake the Milburn
          Coaches hand and then he runs back to his bench and is
          greeted by Mike.

           Sorry, Stemler. You're a champ.
                         
                          MIKE
           Come here, Stemler.
                         
          Mike takes Stemler by the shoulders.

           You've been practicing for a long
           time. You're ready for this. You
           hear me?
                         
          Stemler nods.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           If you get in trouble out there,
           you just listen to me. I'm right
           here, OK?
                         
          Stemler nods again. Too scared to respond.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           OK. You are not going to get
           pinned! You hear me! No way!
                         
                          STEMLER
                          (BARELY AUDIBLE)
           No way. No way.
                         
                          MIKE
           Good. Now I'm going to slap you.
           Ready?
                         
                          STEMLER
           Yeah but not so hard.
                         
          Mike gives him an odd half-slap and Stemler runs out to the
          mat and takes his place at the line. The team cheers.
                         
          But then the other WRESTLER runs out. He is wearing a BLACK
          PROTECTIVE FACE MASK. Stemler spins away from the line and
          looks pleading at Mike.
                         
                          STEMLER (CONT'D)
           Holy shit! It's Darth Vader! Are
           you kidding me? No way!
                         
          He does look like Darth Vader. But in a singlet.
                         
           MIKE/TERRY/VIGMAN
           Don't worry. It's just a mask. You

          Stemler buys it.
                         
                          STEMLER
           Yeah. You're right.
                         
          Stemler returns to the line slightly more confident. The Ref
          blows the whistle and the match starts. Stemler is
          immediately taken down. Terry looks at his feet.

          It's late in third period. Stemler is losing 13-0. Stemler
          is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled. The Ref calls
          him for stalling. One point. 14-0. Thirty seconds to go.

                          VIGMAN
           He's one point away from a tech
           fall and we'd lose on criteria.
                         
                          MIKE

                          VIGMAN
           If he falls behind by fifteen
           points it's a technical fall. They
           get five team points. If that
           happens the score would be tied but
           we'd lose the match on criteria.

          Off Stemler's confused look.

          Stemler almost manages a smile and then he hits "the move".
          It's not pretty but somehow he manages to get up and out. The
          team goes nuts. One point for Stemler. 15-1.
                         
          The Other kid frantically tries to take him down but Stemler
          holds him off dancing wildly around the mat. The buzzer
          sounds. The team goes nuts.
                         
          The Ref raises the other wrestler's hand in victory but it's
          Stemler who celebrates as if he just won the states. He runs
          off the mat and into the arms of his teammates.

           Thank you very much.
                         
                          MIKE
           Can I get you a drink or something?
                         
          Jackie shoots Mike a look. A drink?
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           Water or soda or anything?
                         
                          CINDY
           No. No thanks. I'm fine.
                         
                          MIKE
           Right. OK. So I'll go get Kyle.
                         
          Mike starts to go but Cindy doesn't quite seem ready.
                         
                          CINDY
           How's he doing?
                         
                          MIKE
           Oh, he's doing really well. He's
           going to the high school here and
           he's wrestling on the team
           actually.
                         
                          CINDY
           Really? That's good. He loves
           wrestling so much.
                         
                          JACKIE
           He's a really sweet kid. Our girls
           love him.
                         
                          CINDY
           That's nice.
                         
          Cindy starts to tremble.

           I am so sorry about this...it's
           just been such a difficult time...
                         
          Jackie and Mike share a look. Then Jackie caves and slides
          over next to her.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Oh hey...these things happen,
           Cindy. And we've loved having him.

                          MIKE
           You know Kyle's doing really well
           with wrestling here, Cindy. The
           regions are this weekend and if he
           wins there then he goes to the
           states.
                         
                          CINDY
           That's great.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah. It is and it could be really
           good for him. It might even mean a
           scholarship. Anyway, I was
           wondering if you could stay here
           for another three weeks until
           that's all over.

           I'd like to but don't think I can

           So do I and I'm sure we can. Now,
           I'm sorry, but I actually have to
           go see a client so we'll have to
           set up another time to discuss

          Mike smiles but then his smile fades. Cindy Timmons is
          standing against the wall. She steps forward and Kyle sees
                         HER
                         
                          CINDY

          Kyle keeps his head down and keeps walking. Mike looks
          shocked but also keeps walking.

          Mike and Kyle are face to face.
                         
                          MIKE
           Listen to me. One more win and we
           are going to the states. That's
           what counts. That's all that
           matters. You hear me?
                         
          Kyle nods. Mike can tell that he's half listening.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           Hey! Kyle. Stay in this, OK. This
           is your place. You are in control,
           remember! You control it. Now go
           get him. Finish this!
                         
          Mike slaps him. And Kyle races to the mat.
                         
          The wrestlers slap hands and THE REF blows the whistle. Kyle
          immediately shoots in for a double leg. The Other Wrestler
          tries to sprawl but Kyle is in too deep. Kyle lifts him high
          and dumps him hard to the mat. The audience reacts and the
          Ref stops the action. The other wrestler bravely pops up but
          he is obviously stung.

          Kyle looks at Mike and nods but his eyes are wild. The Ref
          blows the whistle and Kyle and the Other Wrestler lock up.
          They dance a bit and finally the Other Wrestler tries to wrap
          Kyle up. Kyle back pedals and then literally throws the Other
          Wrestler off the mat. The Ref has seen enough. He quickly
          issues Kyle his second warning and disqualifies him from the
          match. It's over.
                         
          The Other Wrestler pops up and runs at Kyle. Kyle responds.
          The Coaches all intervene. It's a melee.

          and sits down next to him.

           Hey, it's alright.
                         
          Mike puts his arm on his shoulder and Kyle starts to cry.
          Mike squeezes him.

          Mike, Terry and Kyle walk out of the school. The entire
          family is waiting for them. Jackie gives Kyle a big hug. Abby
          takes his hand. They all get into their car. Mike is just
          about to get in but then he sees Cindy standing by her car
          watching. He shuts his door and crosses to her.

           Yeah, well your son had a pretty
           good chance to do something special
           in there. Maybe even change his
           life and that's gone now. I hope

           day. It sounded like you hated the
           guy.

           You have no idea what my father
           used to be like. No idea! He wasn't

           And that's why you're doing all

                          MIKE
           Alright, I'll tell you what. You
           want the commission? You can have
           it. And you don't even have to take

           It's the court transcript from when
           Leo was in court. My lawyer got it.
           Read the parts in yellow. See what
           it says.

           This isn't real. The Judge told Leo
           he had to live there.

           No, honey. This is official from

           He gets paid for being Leo's
           guardian, Kyle. And then he just
           put him in that place so he didn't
           have to worry about him.
                         
          Kyle stares at the page.

           Because we deserve that money,

          Jackie takes it and looks at it.

           It's from the court.

                          KYLE
           You're just like her.
                         
          He runs out. They all give chase.

          Mike runs outside and see's Kyle crossing the lawn. He
          quickly catches up to him. Terry and Jackie follow close
          behind.

          Mike grabs Kyle one more time. Kyle rips his arm away and
          tries to push Mike back.

          Mike deflects Kyle and Kyle spills to the ground.

           Oh shit.
                         
          Kyle gets up and starts to circle Mike. Mike has no choice
          but reciprocate.
                         
                          MIKE

           How you lied to Leo?
                         
          Kyle head pumps. Mike takes the bait and jumps back.

          Kyle, stop for a minute. Keep your hands out, Mike.
           Hands out.

           You're not helping.
                         
          Kyle head fakes again but this time he's in. Before Mike
          knows what hits him, he's on his back.
                          MIKE TERRY

          Kyle is all over Mike. Mike's trying to fight back but it's
          useless and even kind of pathetic.

          Terry rushes in and tries to pull Kyle off but he's lost it.
          Finally, he wraps his arms around Kyle and pulls him off.
          Kyle spins free and fronts Terry. Terry immediately puts up
          his hands.

                          MIKE
           Because it would have been too much
           work to leave him here. I couldn't
           have done it.

          INT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Jackie and Mike walk downstairs. Kyle is angrily gathering
          his stuff and putting it in his back pack.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Hey Kyle. How'd you get down here?

                          JACKIE
           Are you hungry? I was gonna make
           some pancakes.
                         
                          KYLE
           No. I'm leaving. I just came to get
           my shit.
                         
          They share a look and walk over to Kyle.
                         
                          MIKE
           Kyle, listen, I just wanted to say
           I'm sorry...
                         
                          KYLE
           I know, Mike, you're sorry.
           Everyone's always sorry.
                         
                          MIKE
           I moved Leo back home, Kyle. And
           I'm gonna fight to keep him there.
                         
                          KYLE
           It's too late. You'll lose. My
           mother's gonna take him.

                          KYLE
           So what?! You want me to forgive
           you now? Is that it, Mike?!
                         
                          MIKE
           No. I just want you to give me
           another chance. That's all I'm
           asking.
                         
          Mike's sincerity is undeniable. Kyle looks to Jackie. They
          connect. Kyle shakes his head, turns around, and then throws
          his bag.
                         
                          KYLE
           This is bullshit!
                         
          Mike looks at Jackie.
                         
                          MIKE
           Hey, Kyle, listen -
                         
                          KYLE
           I want to be alone.

           What?
                         
                          KYLE
           (Without looking at them)

                          MIKE
           OK. All right. Yeah.
                         
          Jackie and Mike turn and start to walk upstairs but Jackie
          stops.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Kyle, I just wanna say - we love
           you.
                         
          Kyle keeps his back turned to them as they continue up the
          stairs.

          Mike is sitting alone at the kitchen table drinking a cup of
          coffee. The remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table.
          There is one clean plate where Kyle usually sits.
                         
          After a moment, Kyle comes up from the basement and sits down
          at the table without saying anything.
                         
          He just looks at Mike. Then he serves himself a few pancakes.
          Mike passes him the bottle of syrup. He takes it and puts
          some on his pancakes.
                         
          He eats. Mike watches.

                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           You want an umbrella with that?
                         
                          TERRY
           Nah. I'm good. But keep these
           coming.
                         
          Mike checks a ticket and prepares two drinks.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           So how you doing, pal?
                         
                          MIKE
           Me? I'm pretty good.
                         
          We hold on Mike as he continues to work.
                         
           BLACK OUT.

                                     Earl W. Wallace

               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTY, PA. COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

               TITLE SEQUENCE

               The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, 
               as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND 
               TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The 
               CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, 
               then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar 
               faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are 
               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               Through the last traces of early morning mist another group 
               of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the 
               landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.

               Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern 
               figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, 
               his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired 
               like his father, peering out.

               The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS 
               on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES 
               on the pavement.

               ANOTHER LANE

               Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of 
               three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a 
               leafless thicket of hickory.

               VALLEY

               A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen 
               buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.

               BARNYARD

               Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses 
               have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of 
               the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  FRONT PORCH

               As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women 
               and children presumably first).

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse 
               has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen 
               partially covering the bearded face.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of 
               the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred-
               fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows 
               of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the 
               f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy 
               a special Place.

               RACHEL LAPP

               A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and 
               drawn.

               In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too 
               many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual 
               woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.

               Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would 
               appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.

               And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered  yet 
               not unkind  features grief-stricken.

               THE MOURNERS

               Their faces...

               CLOCK

               As it begins to CHIME nine a.m.

               FAVORING PREACHER

               As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation 
               remove their hats also.

               Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     PREACHER
                         ...a brother has been called home. 
                         God has spoken through the death of 
                         our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

               THE FAMILY

               Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion 
               and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:

                                     PREACHER
                         ...husband of Rachel, father to 
                         Samuel, son of Eli.
                              (and)
                         His chair is empty, his bed is empty, 
                         his voice will be heard no more. He 
                         was needed in our presence, but God 
                         needs such men, too. That one should 
                         be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. 
                         Still, we would not wish him back. 
                         Rather we should prepare ourselves 
                         to follow him.

               TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in 
               silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the 
               pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.

               As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the 
               grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a 
               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty 
               air.

               RACHEL

               TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post 
               funeral, midday meals.

               Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of 
               soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, 
               preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.

               RACHEL

               Where she sits among women, accepting their condolences.

               DANIEL HOCHSTETLER

               A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. 
               There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic 
               set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly 
               what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up 
               man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group 
               of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, 
               BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp was a good farmer. None better.

                                     BEILER
                         But not the man to buy a horse for 
                         you.
                              (and)
                         Hochstetler, wasn't it your father 
                         sold him that horse with a ruptured 
                         testicle?

                                     TOM
                              (grins)
                         Told him it was a bee sting made him 
                         limp that way.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (amused)
                         That horse had one good ball. That's 
                         all it takes.

               The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on 
               Rachel.

               RACHEL

               As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a 
               tree in front of her.

               At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. 
               All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, 
               tune in as Rachel looks up.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let 
                         us hope he walks close with God.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sure he does, Daniel.

               FIELDS, LAPP FARM  DAY

               It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is 
               hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The 
               death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three  
               Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli 
               work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up 
               from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach  
               it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a 
               word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various 
               tasks associated with the work in hand.

               Daniel works close beside Rachel.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROADS, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family 
               take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the 
               reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad, 
               to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a 
               chance to cross a busy interstate highway.

               EXT. HIGHWAY, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it 
               trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a 
               procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to 
               overtake it.

               EXT. PLATFORM, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, 
               Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming 
               to her cheek.

                                     RACHEL
                         Daniel?

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I... I was at the feed store. And I 
                         saw your horse, so...

               There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival 
               of the train.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         You will come back soon?

               Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his 
               mother's hand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Quickly, Mother Quickly!

               Rachel embraces Eli.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful out among them English.

               She turns to Hochstetler.

                                     RACHEL
                         I need time, Daniel.

               EXT. CARPARK, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open 
               wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his 
               horse off at a fast trot.

               EXT. TRAIN  DAY

               The ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly 
               forward.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               As Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him 
               to light up.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Look, Mama...!

               HIS POV THROUGH WINDOW

               A road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in 
               his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts 
               to keep pace with the train.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see, darling.

               And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he 
               can.

               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

               The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted 
               with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish 
               farmers working their horse-drawn equipment.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               As the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares 
               raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the 
               countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot 
               air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he 
               looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to 
               suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots 
               and fast food outlets.

               EXT. PHILADELPHIA SLUMS

               As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets 
               choked with cars and the gutters with filth.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, 
               almost apprehension:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is this where we're going?

                                     RACHEL
                         Of course not. We're going to 
                         Baltimore. It's much nicer in 
                         Baltimore.

               And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the 
               window.

               INT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress 
               of the two Amish  particularly Samuel's black coat and hat 
                are drawing curious stares.

               SAMUEL

               He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a 
               little girl about his own age, standing in line with her 
               parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother...

               ANGLE

               As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock 
               coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, 
               from appearances, be an Amishman.

               Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we 
               discover that he is a Hasidic Jew.

               SAMUEL

               As he reacts.

               BACK TO TICKET COUNTER

               As Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and 
               she shows him her ticket.

                                     RACHEL
                         We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where 
                         is that train, please?

                                     TICKET SELLER
                         Delayed three hours. You'll hear an 
                         announcement when it's time to board.

               He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and 
               puts it on his head.

               ANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM

               As Samuel enters.

               It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops 
               before one of the urinals  a long, trough-like affair with 
               water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.

               It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING 
               FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel 
               stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, 
               stoops to see which are empty.

               HIS POV  TOILETS

               Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel 
               is alone in the restroom.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a 
               stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily 
               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, 
               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind 
               a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.

               Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large 
               BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. 
               His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and 
               a short leather jacket.

               They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.

               The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for 
               him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close 
               confines of the lavatory.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he 
               can see their feet under the edge of the door.

               BACK TO FIGHT

               As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young 
               man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.

               The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's 
               hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've 
               accomplished with a stunned expression:

                                     PARTNER
                         Jesus...

               The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with 
               blood.

               He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his 
               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. 
               Then he collapses to the floor.

               The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, 
               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind 
               the dispenser.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder 
               we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the 
               backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we 
               catch sight of the black man's face.

               SAMUEL

               As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes 
               the stall door.

               ANGLE IN STALL

               Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and 
               won't fall closed.

               BLACK MAN

               As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. 
               His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.

               The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, 
               glances at the row of stalls.

               HIS POV  STALLS

               All quiet, but...

               BACK TO SCENE

               The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting 
               at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on 
               the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.

               BLACK MAN

               He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.

               BLACK MAN

               As he gives the door a kick. It holds. He swears under his 
               breath.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of... 
               he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the 
               black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the 
               process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just 
               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that 
               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's 
               framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking 
               down our throats.

               ANGLE

               As his partner snaps from the doorway:

                                     PARTNER
                         Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!

               A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to 
               follow the partner out.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory. A 
               long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack.

               HIS POW THROUGH DOOR

               Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror... 
               then PANNING DOWN to the still figure of the young man lying 
               in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.

               BENCH WAITING ROOM  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT

               Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes 
               staring.

               Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various 
               police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally 
               obscuring the lonely couple. There is considerable ECHOING 
               NOISE as commands and requests mingle with the CRACKLE OF 
               TWO-WAY RADIOS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOOR  MEN'S' ROOM

               The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the 
               Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, 
               who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the 
               crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with 
               a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black 
               partner  about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing 
               a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably  
               dressed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BENCH

               Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as 
               Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN.

                                     BOOK
                         You found the body?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported 
                         it. It was the kid.

                                     BOOK
                         What kid?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         How'n hell do I know what kid? The 
                         kid in the funny black threads.

               TIGHT SHOT  SAMUEL

               Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move 
               suddenly to his left.

               BOOK'S LEGS  SAMUEL'S POV

               Coming in at full stride, then stopping.

               SAMUEL

               He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, 
               slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's 
               belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his 
               face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then...

               ANGLE  BOOK

               As his face breaks into a big grin, and...

                                     BOOK
                         Hi, kid.

               RACHEL

               Immediately alarmed, intervening.

                                     RACHEL
                         What do you want of my son?

               THE SCENE

               As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm a police officer. I'm going to 
                         have to talk to the boy. What's his 
                         name?

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel. Samuel Lapp.
                              (then, quickly)
                         But what happened here is none of 
                         his affair. My sister is expecting 
                         me... our train is leaving soon.

                                     BOOK
                         There'll be another train.
                              (turns to Samuel)
                         The man who was killed tonight was a 
                         policeman, Sam. It's my job to find 
                         out who did it. I want you to tell 
                         me everything you saw when you went 
                         in there.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stammers)
                         I saw him.

                                     BOOK
                         Who'd you see?

               Sam looks at his mother.

                         Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the 
                         floor?

                                     SAMUEL
                         No... I saw the man who killed him.

               Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to 
               Carter.

                                     BOOK
                         Anybody know about this?

                                     CARTER
                         I didn't even know about it.

                                     BOOK
                              (back to Sam)
                         Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he 
                         looked like?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (groping, touching 
                              his clothes and 
                              pointing at Carter)
                         He was... like him.

                         Black... I understand. What else,Sam?

               A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather 
               slightly built partner:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Not Zwartich, like him 

               Book frowns, puzzled:

                                     BOOK
                         Try that one again, Sam 

               Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel 
               intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:

                                     RACHEL
                         May I talk to you?

               ANGLE

               As Rachel takes Book aside, and in a low voice:

                                     RACHEL
                         Zwartich. It's the way we say... 
                         dwarf.
                              (glances at Carter)
                         Not like him... very big.

               Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion 
               off screen catches his attention.

               BOOK'S POV  ONCOMING COPS

               It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past 
               the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off 
               reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's 
               got in tow:

               BACK TO SCENE

               AS DONAHUE COMES ON BOOK:

                                     DONAHUE
                              (to aides)
                         Close it all down... I want a man on 
                         every exit... I want the lab in here 
                         now!
                              (to Book)
                         And I want to talk to you, Captain.

               ANGLE

               As Book steps aside with Donahue... In the b.g. Rachel moves 
               protectively to Samuel's side.

                         This is homicide  not Internal 
                         Affairs! So why are you behaving 
                         like you own this case?

                         Terry.
                              (then)
                         I've got a call into Schaeffer.

               RACHEL / SAMUEL

               They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue 
               and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's 
               obviously intense and angry:

                                     SAMUEL
                              (alarmed)
                         Momma... are they angry with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (reassuring, but hardly 
                              in her own mind)
                         No... No. It is just the English 
                         way.

               Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:

                                     DONAHUE
                         You ought to think about coming back

               EXT. 30TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses 
               to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit 
               in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and 
               opens the door.

                                     BOOK
                         Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.

               The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside 
               him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. SEDAN

               Book sits next to SCHAEFFER, a surprisingly kindly looking 
               man of about fifty. Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief.

                         That's the problem. We need results. 
                         The press is driving us crazy over

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between 
               neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened 
               storefronts.

               Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat 
               looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters 
               huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the 
               POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST 
               EVERY FEW MINUTES.

                                     CARTER

                         It won't happen again.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not a joke.

               Book decides to try contrition:

                                     BOOK
                         You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, 
                         I know a little about the Amish. I 
                         know this has to be an ordeal for 
                         you; and I'm really sorry you an 
                         Samuel got involved.

               Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his 
               mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book 
               frowns.

                                     BOOK
                         What was that?

                         know anything about you.

               Book eyes Samuel:

               EXT. 13TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened 
               little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's 
               side window.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR  NIGHT

               Book lowers the window.

               The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the 
               back seat.

                                     SAMMY

                         Try "Happy Valley".

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY BAR, SOUTH STREET  NIGHT

               Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get 
               out, and move swiftly inside.

               INT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on 
               the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and 
               move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this 
               point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've 
               approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did 
               the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their 
               move...

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, 
               violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see 
               Coalmine is not the killer.

               As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police 
               squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. 
               An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's 
               face down next to the car window.

                                     BOOK
                         Put some light on him.

               A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over 
               Coalmine's face.

                                     BOOK
                              (continuing; to Samuel)
                         Look at him.

               Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at 
               Samuel inside the car:

               Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.

               Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and 
               slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing 
               his face up against the front window. His face takes on a 
               grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his 
               partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away 
               by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has 
               horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he 
               gets back in the car.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, you listen to me! I will 
                         have no further part in this, nor 
                         will my son! As God stands between 
                         us!

               Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off.

               EXT. HOTEL  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN 
               moves to open the rear door.

               INT. CAR  NIGHT

               Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is 
               puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests.

               Book and Carter exchange a glance.

               EXT. / INT. FRONT DOOR, SUBURBAN HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  
               NIGHT

               An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers 
               stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house. 
               This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to 
               follow Rachel inside.

               As she glances in a doorway.

               HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN

               It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the 
               table littered with empty beer cans.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.

               Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the 
               other one.

               Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A 
               beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.

                                     ELAINE
                         Everything okay?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes, thank you very much.

                                     ELAINE
                              (a beat)
                         John said you're Amish.

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blankly)
                         Oh.

               She nods and goes.

               Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up 
               at her bleakly.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I don't want to stay here.

                                     RACHEL
                         They are English. They don't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I wish dawdie was with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (swallows)
                         I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.

               She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she 
               frowns, and...

               EXT. DRIVE-IN FAST-FOOD JOINT  PHILADELPHIA  DAWN

               Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple 
               of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into 
               the car.

               Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut. 
               Its clear they've worked through the night.

               EXT. ELAINE'S HOUSE  DAY

               Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces, 
               which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street.

               INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE

               As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt, 
               turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.

               ANGLE

               But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and 
               FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine 
               gasps, Fred manages to grunt.

                                     FRED
                         Wrong door, kid.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Samuel quickly shuts the door. A straight-faced beat; 
               then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               As Rachel appears in the living room entry. Samuel is sitting 
               on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching 
               television.

               They're eating cold cereal out of a box.

               RACHEL'S POV  TV SCREEN

               Some artless Saturday morning cartoon.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring 
               hypnotically. And...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily, 
               appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.

               HER POV  KIDS

               Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows 
               while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. The TV is 
               off.

               BACK TO ELAINE

               As she stares.

               ANGLE IN KITCHEN

               Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen 
               finishing a brisk mop of the floor. The coffee is perking. 
               Elaine appears.

                                     ELAINE
                              (mutters)
                         Jesus...

               Rachel turns cheerily.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good morning.

                                     ELAINE
                              (helplessly)
                         You didn't have to...

                                     RACHEL
                         I wanted to. you were kind to take 
                         us in last night.
                              (and)
                         Anyway, I needed something to do. I 
                         was so angry with your brother. He's 
                         so... agaanisish!

                                     ELAINE
                         Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like 
                         John.

               She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         Just a minute. I'll pour you some 
                         coffee.

                                     ELAINE
                         You're not carrying a bullwhip... 
                         how'd you manage to put my kids to 
                         work?

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         I made it a contest... the one who 
                         does best gets his cereal back first.
                              (and)
                         Children like to help... they only 
                         need to be kept after a little bit.

               Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to 
               storm.

                                     ELAINE
                         Oh, is that so?
                              (and)
                         No offense, lady, but I'm not so 
                         sure I like the idea of your coming 
                         in here and turning the place upside 
                         down!

               Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, I didn't mean...

               Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's 
               hands.

               She mops furiously as she Continues:

                                     ELAINE
                         I know exactly what you meant! Listen, 
                         maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, 
                         but maybe I don't have time to polish 
                         the goddamn china and keep after the 
                         kids!
                              (and)
                         It's none of your business, but I 
                         don't happen to have a man around 
                         here full time. So I sell cosmetics 
                         in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes 
                         I can even pay the rent on time! So 
                         maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe 
                         I don't need to have it jammed down 
                         my throat like this.

               She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:

                                     ELAINE
                         There is that clean enough for you?

               Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting 
               into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his 
               undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.

                                     FRED
                         Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and 
                         leave you a broom?

               Not a politic observation on Fred's part.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blurts)
                         Go to hell, Fred!

               And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares 
               after her.

                                     FRED
                         What's bugging her?

               Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, 
               letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.

               INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

               As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door 
               behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.

                                     RACHEL
                         I brought your coffee.

               She takes a seat next to the bed.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that 
                         way.

               After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:

                                     ELAINE
                         It's okay.
                              (and)
                         Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. 
                         It's like... somehow... I've let 
                         everything get away from me. And you 
                         sort of made me face it.

               She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private 
               thought.

                                     ELAINE
                         What's so funny?

                                     RACHEL
                         Fred. The way he looked when you 
                         screamed at him.

                                     ELAINE
                              (disparing)
                         God, Fred...

                                     RACHEL
                         At home you'd never hear a woman 
                         scream at a man that way.

                                     ELAINE
                         No? Why not?

                                     RACHEL
                         You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish 
                         way.
                              (then)
                         But I think it would have done me 
                         good if I could have screamed at 
                         your brother last night.

                                     ELAINE
                         Listen, I don't know what's going on 
                         or how you got mixed up with him, 
                         but don't you let that self-righteous 
                         son of a bitch push you around, okay?

               Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Okay.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Book glances irritably at Rachel:

                                     BOOK
                         Now what's the problem?

                                     RACHEL
                         The problem is I don't happen to 
                         think my son should be spending all 
                         his time with a man who carried a 
                         gun under his coat and goes around 
                         whacking people.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Whacking?

                                     RACHEL
                              (firmly)
                         Yes. And I also want to leave this 
                         city.

                                     BOOK
                         Believe me, I'm trying to get this 
                         over with as fast as I can. But Samuel 
                         will probably have to come back and 
                         testify.

                                     RACHEL
                         We do not go into your courts.

                                     BOOK

                         directly into our jail.

               Rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly 
               note for a beat.

                              (and)
                         I heard the other police talking

                              (glances at him)
                         I would not be too sure.

               Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something 
               to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.

                                     RACHEL
                         He says you look very tired. I thought 
                         the same thing.

               Book says nothing.

                                     RACHEL
                         But not a good tired.

                                     BOOK
                         What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.

               She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into 
               his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility.

               INT. IDENTIFICATION ROOM  POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They 
               are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. 
               Samuel shakes his head  another negative.

               Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow 
               gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an 
               inquiring look. It's a peace offering.

               Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just 
               as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches 
               over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at 
               Samuel.

                                     BOOK
                              (to Rachel)
                         Just wanted to see if you were on 
                         your toes.

               EXT. CITY PARK  DAY

               Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of 
               hot dogs heaped with kraut.

               Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch. 
               Rachel eyes him a beat. then:

                                     RACHEL
                         Your sister said you don't have a 
                         family?

                                     BOOK
                         No.

                                     RACHEL
                         She thinks you should get married 
                         and have children of your own. Instead 
                         of trying to be a father to hers. 
                         Except she thinks you're afraid of 
                         the responsibility.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Oh? Anything else?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes. She thinks you like policing 
                         because you think you're right about 
                         everything. And you're the only one 
                         who can do anything. And that when 
                         you drink a lot of beer you say things 
                         like none of the other police would 
                         know a crook from a... um... bag of 
                         elbows.

               Book is staring at her. Rachel nods.

                                     RACHEL
                         I think that's what she said.

               Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing 
               looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles 
               proudly.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good appetite.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUTER OFFICE/WAITING ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Rachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police 
               clerks eyeing her curiously. A sign on the desk reads 
               "Narcotics Division."

               Rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially 
               open door.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION, POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               A group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid 
               conversation by the opening of the main office door. They 
               stare in considerable surprise.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOHN BOOK

               Standing in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand.

                                     BOOK
                         Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you 
                         to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a 
                         little help.

               INT. SMALL OFFICE, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               A Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several 
               volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a 
               similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on 
               the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.

               The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously  
               internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the 
               working policemen in any department.

                                     KAMAN
                         There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone 
                         for you.

               Book gets up and moves to the door.

                                     KAMAN
                         And, Captain, don't want to rush 
                         you, but I'm gonna need these files 
                         back in a half hour. We got a lot of 
                         work to do round here.

               The two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his 
               perch and following the direction taken by Book.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in 
               a cubicle of an office.

               Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the 
               bustle of the squadroom.

               He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques 
               and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of 
               outstanding duty and achievement.

               ANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE

               As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes 
               are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.

               Until suddenly he freezes.

               SAMUEL'S POV  NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT

               Enlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: "Division 
               Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project". Accompanying the 
               item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy  clearly the 
               black man who murdered the young cop in the train station 
               men's room.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               He stares, transfixed.

               A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to 
               Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.

               He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that 
               they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to 
               point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small 
               hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. 
               He smiles gently at the boy.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  PHILADELPHIA  DUSK

               Rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding 
               Samuel close. Book glances at her:

                                     RACHEL
                         Why don't you arrest that man? Are 
                         you protecting him because policeman?

                                     BOOK
                              (snaps)
                         Listen, I'm the cop that polices the 
                         police. I'm not in the business of 
                         protecting crooked cops.
                              (eases up)
                         I'll make an arrest when I know 
                         everybody involved.

               Rachel shakes her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         But why would they murder...

                                     BOOK
                         Because  somehow  they knew I was 
                         getting close.
                              (and)
                         Look, it's narcotics... They make 
                         dope out of chemicals... they sell 
                         it on the street for millions of 
                         dollars. They'll do anything.
                              (and)
                         And they can get away with it because 
                         they're cops.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat, then)
                         I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I 
                         want to go home.

                                     BOOK
                         You'll be safe. You don't have to 
                         worry.

               She says nothing.

               Another beat, then:

                                     BOOK
                         Look, they're thinking as long as 
                         they keep the killer out of Samuel's 
                         way, we can't make an I.D. There's 
                         no way they can know Samuel saw that 
                         photograph, so he's safe.

               He glances at her, but she continues ahead.

                                     BOOK
                         I mean it. You will be safe.

               Suddenly Rachel explodes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we 
                         feel safe in a city where the police 
                         are so busy killing each other!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. SCHAEFFER HOME, PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS  NIGHT

               The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is 
               opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised 
               and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY 
               is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed 
               inside.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S STUDY  NIGHT

               Schaeffer passes Book a drink.

               Book is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase, 
               closing on his quarry:

                                     BOOK
                         It was McElroy, Paul.

               Schaeffer gives him a sharp look:

                                     BOOK
                         Last guy I would have figured. But 
                         he's part of it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I hope you don't have any doubts 
                         about that.

                                     BOOK
                         If I did, I'd have kept my mouth 
                         shut...
                              (and)
                         It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons 
                         of P2P confiscated four years ago... 
                         Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.
                              (excited, explaining 
                              the thing eagerly)
                         He salts it away somewhere... he 
                         knows the stuff is potent, but the 
                         street chemists haven't figured out 
                         how to process it. But they do now.
                              (and)
                         And now the stuff is worth five-grand 
                         a pint and there are a lot of pints 
                         in a fifty-five gallon drum.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (beat)
                         Who else knows?

                                     BOOK
                         Just us.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (shakes his head)
                         Okay, what are you going to need to 
                         clean it up

                                     BOOK
                         More people... Gotta pick up where 
                         Zenovich left off. People from outside 
                         the department.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (nods)
                         Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards 
                         at Treasury. I'll take care of it.
                              (then)
                         I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut 
                         their balls off for me. I'm counting 
                         on you.

               Schaeffer pours himself another drink.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What's your first move?

                                     BOOK
                              (expels a breath)
                         A hot shower... I haven't changed 
                         clothes in two days.

               EXT. PARKING LOT  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being 
               locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports 
               section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward 
               his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports 
               section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts 
               to take a step... and looks up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the 
               other side of the parking lot crosswalk

               BACK TO BOOK

               Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.

               MCELROY

               Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping 
               bag (which he appeared to be carrying)  letting the shopping 
               bag fall away as he does so  revealing a five-inch barrel 
               Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. 
               Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES 
               once.

               BOOK

               Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven 
               into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:

               MCELROY

               Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a 
               WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. 
               And McElroy still smiling as:

               BOOK

               Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send 
               Book down hard and grasping.

               MCELROY

               Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely 
               taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book 
               toward McElroy.

               He smiles at them.

               BOOK

               Down, muttering CURSES.

               THE SCENE

               As McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement, 
               keeps on going... and is gone.

               BOOK

               GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And 
               we HEAR  from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream.

                                     SCHAEFFER (V.O.)
                         Who else knows?

                         Just us.

               As the lights of an oncoming car  going very slowly, on its 
               way to a parking space  sweep over him and we HEAR it come 
               to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get 
               to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, 
               using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car 
               door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, 
               accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the 
               oncomers,

               ANGLE

               A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of 
               Book, looks on edgily:

                                     MAN
                         Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little 
                         too much to drink?

               Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.

               BOOK'S WOUND

               As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck 
               him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other 
               just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).

               THE SCENE

               As the man stares:

                                     MAN
                         Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a 
                         hospital!
                              (and)
                         Here; I'll give you a hand.

               He starts to approach, but Book shoves him away.

                                     BOOK
                         No! No hospital!

               By now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance:

                                     WIFE
                         Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to 
                         die in the street, that's his 
                         business!

               But the man is not content:

                                     MAN
                         Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at 
                         that blood?

               Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to 
               intercept him:

                                     MAN
                         Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed 
                         to death!

               Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed 
               squarely at the fat man's face:

                                     MAN
                         Shit!

                                     WIFE
                              (quavering)
                         I told you, Henry!

               Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is 
               sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at 
               the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back 
               toward his car.

               in the wee hours. A woman sleeps beside him.

               As the door opens and Elaine switches on the light, rousing 
               Rachel. Elaine looks haggard.

                                     ELAINE
                         It's John. He says you have to leave 
                         now. He says it's urgent.

               She leaves the room as Rachel instantly awake, moves quickly 
               to rouse Samuel.

               EXT. BATHROOM DOOR

               Elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions 
               from her brother. From inside we hear the SOUND OF RUNNING 
               WATER. Elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency.

               Book looks at himself in the mirror, his face is pale and 
               drawn.

               He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his 
               right side, just under the rib cage. The wound continues to 
               bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting 
               his shirt back on.

               He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin 
               with tissues which he flushes down the toilet.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               As he drives across town. Samuel is curled up asleep, his

               But Book, glancing in his rearview mirror, tenses.

               HIS POV  MIRROR

               In it we can see a police car coming on fast, with lights 
               and SIREN.

               Rachel eyes Book warily.

               A beat, then the police car WAILS past. Book expels a breath.

               across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man.

               away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               As Samuel races for all he's worth across the field, 
               negotiates the creek via a fallen log  Rachel, now, also 
               running toward the car.

               EXT. STABLES  DAY

               Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He 
               hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot.

               ANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR

               We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible 
               in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under 
               his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. 
               Momentarily he comes awake:

                                     RACHEL
                         But John... why didn't you go to a 
                         hospital?

                                     BOOK
                         No, no doctor...

                                     RACHEL
                              (bewildered)
                         But why?

                                     BOOK
                         Gunshot... they'll file reports... 
                         they'll find me.

                                     RACHEL
                         But 

               Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely:

                                     BOOK
                         And when they find me, they'll find 
                         your boy!

               He slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the 
               price he's paid in returning them to safety.

               She reaches out, touches him gently.

               But the moment is broken by...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses 
               to glance into the car.

                                     ELI
                         Is the English dead?

                                     RACHEL
                         No...

                                     ELI
                         Looks dead...

               And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place 
               him in the back of the springwagon. And...

               INT. LAMP FARMHOUSE

               Where Eli is looking out a window.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car.

               ANGLE IN BEDROOM

               Where Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with 
               warm water from a pan.

               Eli appears in the doorway.

                                     ELI
                         Stoltzfus is coming.

               Rachel looks at him, nods.

               Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly 
               folded clothes on a chair near the bed.

                                     ELI
                         That has no place in this house.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know.

               She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places 
               them in a chest.

                                     RACHEL
                         It will go when he goes.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               As Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage 
               son, LEVI.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.

               Stoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         That's the English is it?

               INT. SICKROOM  TIGHT

               As Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of 
               Book's wound:

                                     STOLTZFUS (O.S.)
                         I feel... burning.

               WIDER

               As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, 
               moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the 
               examination.

               Finally he steps back.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         This man should be treated in town.
                              (indicates)
                         The bullet entered there... and came 
                         out there. But there is the danger 
                         of infection, and he has lost a great 
                         deal of blood.

               Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her 
               dilemma.

               Her eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room:

                                     RACHEL
                         Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.

               She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and 
               Stoltzfus:

                                     RACHEL
                         No, he must stay here.

               Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And:

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if 
                         he dies? Then the sheriff will come. 
                         They'll say we broke their laws 

                                     RACHEL
                         We'll pray that he doesn't die! But 
                         if he does, then we'll find a way so 
                         no one knows!

                                     ELI
                         Rachel, this is a man's life, we 
                         hold it in our hands.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know God help me, I know that, 
                         Eli.
                              (then)
                         But I tell you that if he's found 
                         here, the people who did this to him 
                         will come for Samuel.

               Rachel beseeches them helplessly:

                                     RACHEL
                         What else can we do?

               EXT. LAPP DRIVE

               Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and 
               is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel 
               catching a ride on the bumper.

               RACHEL

               Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As 
               the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors.

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

               As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to 
               Rachel:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Make a poultice... three parts milk, 
                         two parts linseed oil... for the 
                         infection.

               I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you.

               Stoltzfus turns to Eli:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp, I'll have to speak with the 
                         diener on this matter.

                                     ELI
                              (nods)
                         As you see fit, Stoltzfus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SICKROOM  LAPS FARM  NIGHT

               As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning 
               low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.

               Book's brow is beaded with sweat.

               Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat-
               soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should 
               get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on 
               display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.

               She begins to apply the poultice.

               ANGLE

               As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he 
               recoils with alarm.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's all right! You have got to lie 
                         still.

               Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what 
               she says seems to penetrate. He quiets.

                                     RACHEL
                              (soothingly)
                         Yes, much better...

               ANGLE

               As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her 
               hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so.

               She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, 
               so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, 
               scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one 
               shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious 
               Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at 
               first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck 
               this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks 
               coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. 
               She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind 
               her.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  DAY

               He's on the phone:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Looks like we're going to need some 
                         help from you folks down there.

               INT. LANCASTER COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE  DAY

               Where an UNDERSHERIFF is on the phone:

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         ...want to help any way we can, Chief, 
                         but you got to understand we've got 
                         upwards of seven thousand Amish over 
                         here.

               And that's just Lancaster County.

               INTERCUT SCHAEFFER

               Who is trying to control his impatience:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. 
                         Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should 
                         simplify your work.

               The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down 
               to.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         How about an address?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Ah... no.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                              (frowns)
                         Maybe a road or route number?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Sorry.

               The Undersheriff is not impressed.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third 
                         Amishman around here is named Lapp. 
                         That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
                              (and)
                         Chief, if the Amish have taken your 
                         man in, I wouldn't want to hang from 
                         a rope until you find him.

               ANGLE

               Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an 
                         education.

               He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then 
               he glances up.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who 
               spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  DAY

               A bright, sunny afternoon.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn. In the b.g. 
               three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty. 
               Visitors.

               ANGLE IN SICKROOM

               Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided. 
               He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room.

               BOOK'S POV  CLERGY

               PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around 
               the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in 
               German.

               These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, 
               sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; 
               and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat 
               apart.

               ANGLE

               Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes.

               Tschantz rumbles in German.

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to 
                         your credit.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         He was touched by God's hand.

               Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with 
               him.

               Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup, 
               smiles.

                         Hello.

               Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen.

                                     BOOK
                              (closing his eyes)
                         Who are they?

                                     RACHEL
                         The leadership of our district... 
                         the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the 
                         one with no hair on top. They decided 
                         to come and see you for themselves. 
                         Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came 
                         the first day. I think he saved your 
                         life.

                         What?

                              (a beat)
                         Listen, thank you. Thanks for 
                         everything. But I've got to go.

                                     RACHEL
                              (frowns)
                         But you can't.

               He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the 
               sheet.

                                     RACHEL
                         See. Anyway, you don't have any 
                         clothes on. And besides that, Bishop 
                         Tschantz wants to talk to you when 
                         you feel better.

               The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and 
               are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket. 
                         And drink my of my tea.

               He goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel 
               puts the teacup to his lips.

                                     BOOK
                         Tell him his tea stinks.

                              (smiles)
                         You tell him. When you're able.

               He looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises.

                                     RACHEL
                              (from the door)
                         We're all very happy that you're 
                         going to live, John Book. We didn't 
                         quite know what we were going to do 
                         with you if you died.

               That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into 
               sleep again.

               As the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         ...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         It is not the first time we have 
                         done this. In the Englischer war of 
                         the revolution, old Elmer Miller's 
                         grandfather took in gunshot English 
                         soldiers.
                              (a tad of pride)
                         Saved them, too.

               They all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then:

                                     ERB
                         Still, he should be among his own 
                         people.

               Rachel enters on this last.

                                     RACHEL
                         He'll leave as soon as he is able. 
                         He already wants to go.

               Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         How long will that be, Stoltzfus?

                                     STOLTZFUS
                              (shrugs)
                         A month. Maybe less. With God's 
                         healing love.

               EXT. BOOK'S SISTER'S HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Schaeffer is knocking at the front doors. A beat, then Elaine 
               opens it cautiously, peers out.

                                     ELAINE
                              (half fearfully)
                         Did you find him?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Not yet.

               Suddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door:

                                     ELAINE
                         Then go away, you bastard.

               Schaeffer quickly  but gently  prevents her from shutting 
               it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I've come to apologize for 
                         Lt. McElroy. He overstated the 
                         department's position.

                                     ELAINE
                              (bitterly)
                         He accused John of taking kickbacks. 
                         And you know  anybody who knows 
                         John  knows that's a goddamn lie!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (smoothly)
                         Of course, Elaine. But as long as 
                         there's any question, better Johnny 
                         should come back and clear his name.

                                     ELAINE
                              (cuts in)
                         Better you should get off my front 
                         porch before I get my mace!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I don't want to have to take 
                         you in for questioning. You've got 
                         his car, you were the last to see 
                         him 

                              (clipped)
                         I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         But... if you had to guess?

               McElroy watching.

               THEIR POV  FRONT DOOR

               We see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer. Elaine 
               forces the door shut. Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his 
               car.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S CAR

               As Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into 
               the seat, beside McElroy.

                                     MCELROY
                         She say where he is?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I don't think she knows.

               Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What about Carter?

                                     MCELROY
                         Tight. But I'm working on him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lean on him.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               REESTABLISHING, and TIGHTENING to the upstairs sickroom window 
               where a lamp dimly burns.

               INT. SICKROOM

               As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep 
               on the bed.

               Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is 
               indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed 
               and opens the clothes chest.

               ANGLE

               Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded 
               clothes.

               Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled 
               pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon 
               from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...

               BOOK

               His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the 
               boy something of a jolt.

                                     BOOK
                         Give me that.

               Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He 
               looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots 
               the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes 
               out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He 
               snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.

                                     BOOK
                         Come here.

               The boy edges closer.

                         You ever handle a pistol like this, 
                         Samuel?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (swallows)
                         No pistol. Ever.

                         Tell you what  I'm going to let you 
                         handle this one. But only if you 
                         promise not to say anything to your 
                         momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (grins)
                         Okay, Mr. Book.

               Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne-
               tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, 
               demonstrating the action.

               He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.

                         Call me John.

               The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but 
               his hands are too small. Book smiles.

               Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two 
               hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so 
               that it's not pointed at him.

                                     BOOK
                         You don't want to point that at people 
                         you just started calling by their 
                         first name.

               Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps 
               the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to 
               find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and 
               Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead.

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         Samuel!

               Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters 
               it:

                                     RACHEL
                         Wait for me downstairs.

               Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, I would appreciate it if, 
                         during the time you are with us, you 
                         would have as little to do with Samuel 
                         as possible.

                         Nobody meant any harm. The boy was 
                         curious. I unloaded the gun -

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not the gun. Don't you 
                         understand... It's you. What you 
                         stand for.
                              (and)
                         That is not for Samuel.

               Book looks at her thoughtfully.

               Rachel softens a bit:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, it has nothing to do with 
                         you personally.

               He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets.

                                     BOOK
                         Put it up someplace Samuel can't get 
                         it.

               A beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go. Book 
               stops her:

                                     BOOK
                         Friends?

               Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN  LAPP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. Eli sits 
               on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other. Rachel looks 
               on from the b.g.

               Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will 
               ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central 
               pillars of the Amish way.

                                     ELI
                         The gun  that gun of the hand  is 
                         for the taking of human life. Would 
                         you kill another man? Eh?

               Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli 
               leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.

                                     ELI
                         What you take into your hands, you 
                         take into your heart.

               A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I would only kill a bad man.

                                     ELI
                         Only a bad man. I see. And you know 
                         these bad men on sight? You are able 
                         to look into their hearts and see 
                         this badness?

                                     SAMUEL
                         I can see what they do.

               Now he meets Eli's eyes:

                                     SAMUEL
                         I have seen it.

               Eli expels a deep sigh; then:

                                     ELI
                         And having seen, you would become 
                         one of them?
                              (intent... gesturing)
                         Don't you see...? The hand leads the 
                         arm leads the shoulder leads the 
                         head... leads the heart. The one 
                         goes into the other into the other 
                         into the other... And you have 
                         changed, and gone amongst them...

               He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the 
               boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly 
               into the tabletop with enormous intensity:

                                     ELI
                         "Wherefore come out from among them 
                         and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"

                                     ELI
                              (indicating pistol; 
                              continuing from 
                              Corinthians 6:17)
                         "And touch not the unclean thing!"

               His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely 
               impressive.

               EXT. WASHHOUSE  NEAR KITCHEN  NIGHT 

               Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most 
               or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way 
               into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come 
               out from the kitchen.

               EXT. BARN  LAPP FARM  DAY

               Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the 
               traces of the buggy.

               INT. BOOK'S BEDROOM  DAY

               Book stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the 
               window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat, 
               then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, 
               picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's 
               a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The 
               Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table.

               There's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing. 
               She smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Enjoying your reading?

                                     BOOK
                         Very interesting. I'm learning a lot 
                         about manure.
                              (eyes the clothing)
                         What's that?

                                     RACHEL
                         Your shirt and jacket are still 
                         stained with blood. I have them 
                         soaking.You can wear these.

               She passes the clothes to Book.

                                     BOOK
                         Your husband's?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes. It's good that someone can have 
                         the use of them. Besides, in your 
                         clothes you'd stand out to strangers.

               She continues, cheerfully.

                                     RACHEL
                         I should tell you these do not have 
                         buttons.
                              (shows him)
                         See? Hooks and eyes.

                                     BOOK
                         Something wrong with buttons?

                                     RACHEL
                         Buttons are Hochmut.

                                     BOOK
                         Hochmut?

                                     RACHEL
                         Vain. Proud. Such a person is 
                         Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.

                                     BOOK
                              (nodding)
                         Anything against zippers?

                                     RACHEL
                              (almost blushing)
                         You make fun of me. Like the tourists.
                         Driving by all the time. Some even 
                         come into the yard. Very rude. They 
                         seem to think we are quaint.

                                     BOOK
                         Quaint? Can't imagine why.

               She smiles.

                                     BOOK
                         Where's the nearest telephone?

                         Telephone? The Gunthers across the 
                         valley. They're Mennonite. They have 
                         cars and refrigerators and telephones 
                         in the houses even.

                                     BOOK
                         No. I'd want a public phone.

               Rachel's face clouds.

                                     RACHEL
                         Well... the store at Saltzburg...
                              (then briskly)
                         But you won't be going to Saltzburg 
                         for a while.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm going this morning.

                                     RACHEL
                         But Stoltzfus said...

                                     RACHEL
                         You can go with Eli. He's taking 
                         Samuel to school. But you'll have to 
                         hurry.

               Rachel turns to leave when Book calls her back.

                                     BOOK
                         Rachel.

               She turns to look at him. It's the first time he's used her 
               name.

                                     BOOK
                         Thanks.

               She smiles and leaves.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Eli calls impatiently from the buggy. Samuel sits beside 
               him.

                                     ELI
                         Hurry up now, John Book!

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter. She laughs 
               out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly 
               so  the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket 
               ill-fitting.

               Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish.

               Outside another SHOUT from Eli.

                                     RACHEL
                         You'd better go.

               Book looks embarrassed.

                                     BOOK
                         My... eh... gun?

               The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a 
               cupboard. She passes the gun in its holster to Book. He 
               fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" 
               increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back 
               to her and checks the weapon. He turns back to her smiling 
               in an odd way.

                                     BOOK
                         The... bullets?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh. The bullets.

               She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to 
               Book.

                                     BOOK
                              (attempting a joke)
                         Not much good without them.

               INT. BUGGY  COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

               Samuel sits between Eli and Book. Both men stare straight 
               ahead.

               Eli looks particularly stern. It's pretty clear he doesn't 
               like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith.

               EXT. AMISH ONE-TEACHER-SCHOOL  DAY

               With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his 
               friends. A teacher begins ringing a bell.

               INT. STORE  SALTZBURG

               Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered. 
               He looks about him  several Amish and Dithers mingle in the 
               shop.

               Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self-
               conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously... A voice 
               comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah?

               A silence.

                                     BOOK
                         It's me.

                                     CARTER
                         Johnny! Where the hell have you been?

                                     BOOK
                         Never mind. I'm coming in to take 
                         care of business. How hot am I?

                                     CARTER
                              (low, urgent)
                         Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm coming.

                                     CARTER
                         Listen, Johnny, don't do anything 
                         stupid. You couldn't get within a 
                         mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay 
                         put... Stay in touch  I'll let you 
                         know when maybe it makes sense.

               A beat as Book considers that.

                                     CARTER
                              (edgily)
                         You hear me?

                                     BOOK
                              (finally)
                         I hear you. I'll stay in touch.

                                     CARTER
                         That's more like it.
                              (and)
                         Where are you at, anyway?

               Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image 
               reflected in the window of the store.

                                     BOOK
                         Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

                                     CARTER
                              (uncomprehending)
                         Say again?

                                     BOOK
                         Make that 1790.

               He hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the 
               store.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's 
               trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted 
               under the front seat of the Lapp buggy.

               Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the 
               disapproving look.

                                     ELI
                         If you are well enough to do that

               lamp.

               He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with 
               undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump:

                                     ELI
                              (briskly)
                         Veck oufl. Time for milking.

               Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his 
               watch.

               As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with 
               Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls. 
               Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs.

               BOOK, ELI

               Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand. 
               We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from 
               scalding milk cans rising behind her).

                                     ELI
                         Good, firm twist and pull, eh?
                              (and)
                         Right. Now you try it.

               Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow 
               shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book 
               bends to his task.

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You 
                         never had your hands on a teat before?

               Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a 
               comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars 
               him.

               Then he moves off. Book bends to his task, and...

               ANGLE  RACHEL

               Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand.

               milk can.

               Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty.

               A beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together 
               against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  DAY

               It is later in the morning. Rachel comes out onto the porch, 
               tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks 
               toward the barn.

               ANGLE  THE BARN

               Eli and Book standing in one of the open doorways, looking 
               in.

               ANGLE FAVORING Luke, one of Eli's team of fine mules as Samuel 
               opens the stall gate. The beast is skittish, obviously 
               afflicted with something of a behavioral problem.

               But he allows Samuel to lead him out.

               BOOK, ELI

               As Samuel brings Luke out. Eli is now harnessing the other 
               mule of the team to a large manure-spreader. But as Luke 
               nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel 
               off his feet.

               Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious 
               mistake. Luke erupts into a SCREAMING, bucking cyclone. Samuel 
                who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover 
               as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off.

               Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he 
               BELLOWS belligerently in German at the rearing animal. Finally 
               he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to 
               have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.

               Samuel gives the shaken Book a look:

                         That's Luke. He doesn't like 
                         strangers.

                         You don't say.

               Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at 
               Book.

               Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car 
               knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses 
               as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, 
               Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing 
               smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes 
               people.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good morning. Book, is it? You are 
                         the Yankee they talk about?

                         English, Yankee. It's the same. My 
                         name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.
                              (sizes up his clothes)
                         You look plain, Book.
                              (grinning)
                         Very plain.

               Book is not particularly amused.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I came to see Rachel Lapp.

                         Try the house.

               Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (genially)
                         You bet. you take care of yourself.

               Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with 
               some interest.

               ANGLE

               As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also 
               catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion 
               crossing her expression for an instant.

               And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.

               Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.

               HOG PENS

               Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is 
               headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He 
               glances toward the house:

               Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing, 
               sharing a pitcher of lemonade.

               Thoughtful... He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow SQUEALS 
               and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she 
               can feed.

               Eli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him:

               Book swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes:

               buggy.

               He glances up as she enters:

               Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the 
               battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the 
               Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major 
               inventions  rock and roll.

               It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more 
               even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's 
               his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous 
               as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in 
               Amish.

               Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book 
               sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel 
               alternately protesting and laughing.

                                     BOOK
                         You like it... Don't you?

               Rachel, confused, protests:

                                     RACHEL
                         No... You just stop 

               But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:

                                     BOOK
                              (mock alarm)
                         Next thing you know you'll be off 
                         drinking beer and racing motorcycles.

               And it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.

               ANGLE  THE BARN DOOR

               As Eli suddenly appears. He glowers for an instant, 
               thunderstruck, then BELLOWS:

                                     ELI
                         Rachel!

               THE SCENE

               As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both 
               turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without 
               discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, 
               turns off the radio, as:

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         What is this? This Myusick?

               Book hesitates, then starts to say something:

                                     BOOK
                         It's not her fault. I 

               But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         How can this be? How can you do such 
                         a thing? Is this plain? Is this the 
                         ordnung?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have done nothing against the 
                         ordnung.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this 
                         man to our house. With his gun of 
                         the hand. You bring fear to this 
                         house. Fear of English with guns 
                         coming after. You bring blood and 
                         whispers of more blood. Now English 
                         music... and you are dancing to 
                         English music! And you call this 
                         nothing?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have committed no sin.

                                     ELI
                              (in English)
                         No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, 
                         it does not look...
                              (tone softening... in 
                              the dialect)
                         Don't you know there has been talk? 
                         Talk about you, not him. Talk about 
                         going to the Bishop. About having 
                         you... shunned!

                                     RACHEL
                         That is idle talk.

                                     ELI
                              (in English, pleading)
                         Do not make light of it, Rachel. 
                         They can do it... quick! Like that! 
                         And then... then I can not sit at 
                         table with you. I can not take a 
                         thing from your hand. I... I can not 
                         go with you to meeting!
                              (the old man almost 
                              breaks down as, in 
                              the dialect)
                         Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go 
                         too far! Dear child!

               Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's 
               plea  but irked by his condescending tone.

                                     RACHEL
                         I am not a child.

                                     ELI
                              (suddenly stern again)
                         You are acting like one!

                                     RACHEL
                         I will be the judge of that.

                                     ELI
                              (fierce as a prophet)
                         No! They will be the judge of that! 
                         And so will I... if you shame me!

                                     RACHEL
                              (blinking a tear now, 
                              but meeting his gaze)
                         You shame yourself.

               And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  NIGHT

               Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences 
               grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled 
               question or statement.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know where he is.

                                     CARTER
                         Wrong.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You'd lie to protect him.

                                     CARTER
                              (cool)
                         Probably.

               Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You admit you're lying?

                                     CARTER
                              (shakes head)
                         I admit I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're the first one he'll contact.

                                     CARTER
                              (sighing)
                         He's got my number.

               Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep 
               breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable 
               of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even 
               CHUCKLES as he begins:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         It's funny. I know he's hiding 
                         somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
                              (a quick glance at 
                              Carter)
                         Can you imagine John Book at a prayer 
                         meeting? Our John Book?

               Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.

               Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt 
               shift in form... but still speaks softly.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Either you're a member of the club 
                         or you aren't, Elton.
                              (he nods his head, as)
                         Tell me what you know...

                                     CARTER
                         What I know, Paul, is...
                              (nodding his head)
                         He's going to take you out...

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading 
               provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.

               BACK TO BOOK  INT. / EXT. BARN

               As he goes into the barn.

               Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the 
               temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his 
               hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.

               Book starts to talk gently to the animal:

                                     BOOK
                         All right, you nasty son of a bitch, 
                         we're going to be friends whether 
                         you like it or not.

               Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall 
               gate.

               ANGLE

               As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, 
               brings out some lumps of sugar.

                                     BOOK
                         See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't 
                         you for Christ's sake?

               Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends 
               to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled 
               expression.

                                     RACHEL
                              (surprised)
                         Well...

               Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!

                                     BOOK
                         Won him over just like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see.
                              (and)
                         But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
                              (then, going)
                         Eli is ready to go to Zook's.

               Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a 
               nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him 
               skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:

                                     BOOK
                         Later.

               And we...

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are 
               arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.

               In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the 
               construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun 
               raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.

               Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are 
               spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot 
               coffee and cold lemonade for the men,

               LAPP BUGGY

               As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the 
               construction site.

                                     ELI
                         Wait here 'til I find a gang you can 
                         work with.

               He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and 
               more workmen and their families climb out.

               Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad 
               face breaks into a grin:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Book! Good to see you!

               He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting 
               and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.

               Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his 
               showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.

               And Book realizes it as well.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

                                     BOOK
                         It's been a while.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         No matter. Come with me. We can always 
                         use a good carpenter.

               With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and 
               ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:

                                     RACHEL
                         Good luck.

               BOOK / HOCHSTETLER

               As they move off.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Your hole is healed, then?

                                     BOOK
                              (gives him a look)
                         Pretty much.

               Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good. Then you can go home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CUTS

               As the morning progresses:

               ...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers 
               on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of 
               competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely 
               unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the 
               gang.

               ...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems  without leaning 
               on it too heavily  to be measuring the two men as the morning 
               progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of 
               them.

               ...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with 
               sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising 
               the construction. All around them the structure is rising 
               with remarkable rapidity.

               ...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge 
               noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., 
               knitting or doing quiltwork.

               ...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a 
               group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls 
               "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).

               ...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs 
               in the sunlight, looking on  the old men kibitzing in German, 
               the women gossiping.

               Until...

               BIG SHOT

               Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at 
               least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about 
               the barn framework...

               ...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, 
               others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and 
               what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing 
               up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in 
               sight.

               WOMEN'S AREA

               As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women 
               eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering. 
               Rachel ignores them.

               She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral 
               sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of 
               fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously 
               liking Rachel.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Everyone has an idea about you and 
                         the English.

                                     RACHEL
                         All of them charitable, I'm sure.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Hardly any of them.

               ANGLE  THE ROOFBEAM

               Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding 
               them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They 
               are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, 
               way out at the far end of the roof.

               Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start 
               to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.

               Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof 
               with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it 
               back together.

               Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.

               Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Nail it!

                                     BOOK
                         Yes, sir.

               And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, 
               looks on.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BIG SHOT

               The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. 
               It's late afternoon.

               ANGLE ON BOOK

               He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The 
               exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of 
               fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's 
               determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, 
               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler 
               guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm 
               about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From 
               below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.

               Hochstetler shouts:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         We admire our work!

               The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes 
               his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his 
               appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no 
               thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding 
               SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  EVENING

               The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer 
               up a blessing on the new barn.

               CONGREGATION

               PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words 
               rolling out over the still evening air.

               Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers 
               he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels 
               something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too 
               closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing 
               prayer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  NIGHT

               Book stands outside, listening to the NIGHT SOUNDS. He turns, 
               walks up toward the porch.

               EXT. PORCH  TARP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night 
               sky.

               There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes 
               toward the door.

               ANGLE  THE DOOR

               Samuel standing there in his nightshirt.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Book leans forward in his chair.

                                     BOOK
                         Hey, Sam...

                                     SAMUEL
                         ...I want to say a thing.

                                     BOOK
                              (sitting up)
                         What's that, Sam?

               The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts 
               across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... 
               then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving 
               the door open behind him.

               ANGLE  BOOK

               Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he 
               speaks softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Same to you, Sam.

               After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door 
               that Samuel has left open behind him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to 
               the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see 
               where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. 
               The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks 
               softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Sam?

               No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind 
               him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen.

               INT. LAPP WASHHOUSE  NIGHT

               Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is 
               pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.

               She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of 
               her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back 
               of a chair.

               Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.

               RACHEL'S POV  FRYING PAN

               The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over 
               the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image 
               reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel hesitates for a moment  and in that moment she makes 
               a choice.

               Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his 
               eyes.

               And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of 
               eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, 
               for an instant, a woman of Book's world.

               BOOK

               As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable 
               to make it happen.

               And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, 
               picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting 
               it on, looks away.

               BOOK

               TIGHTENING to him, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE  HEN YARD

               Where Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens.

               A beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as 
               she senses his presence.

               Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing 
               them in the fold of her apron.

               When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.

                                     BOOK
                         Last night.

               She goes very still, but keeps her back to him.

                                     BOOK
                         If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't 
                         leave.

               She lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from 
               him.

               Book continues to stare at her.

               EXT. RURAL ROAD  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               The Lapp carriage on a winding lane.

               INT. BUGGY (MOVING)

               Rachel is driving, Book sitting next to her. Samuel is in 
               the back, looking out the rear window and not paying any 
               attention to the adults.

               A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all 
               Book can do to keep from flinching.

               Rachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe I ought to learn to drive this 
                         thing.

               Rachel says nothing.

                                     BOOK
                              (beat)
                         Pick myself up another useful skill.

               Now Rachel can't help but smile. She looks at him. And...

               EXT. ANGLE

               We can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection, 
               another buggy approaching at right angles.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield.

                         Samuel, who is that?

               Samuel checks out the buggy.

                                     SAMUEL
                         It looks like Hochstetler's mare.

               EXT. ANGLE

               As the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler 
               buggy swings in behind them. Then the Hochstetler buggy, 
               coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel 
               returns her greeting:

                                     BOOK
                              (teasing her)
                         Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.

               Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick  
               the race is on.

               RACE MONTAGE

               Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together 
               with his young sister  at first they're not aware of the 
               race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and 
               gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and 
               neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.

               It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off 
               Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she 
               gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers 
               of Samuel and Book.

               EXT. SALZBURGSTORE  DAY

               It's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're 
               everywhere  taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY 
               YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence 
               fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.

               Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; 
               the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing 
               smoke pulls up nearby.

               Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's 
               stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She 
               waggles the camera at him...

                                     TOURIST LADY
                         Could I... ah, you know?

                              (smiling)
                         Lady, if you take my picture, I'll 
                         rip your brassiere off and strangle 
                         you with it.

               The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her 
               grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back 
               from whence she came.

               INT. STORE

               Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company 
               of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying 
               Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention 
               as the shopping.

               Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN 
               to him, and...

                         Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.

               A beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia 
               Police Department switchboard:

                                     VOICE

                                     VOICE
                         I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter 
                         was killed in the line of duty...

               Book hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of 
               the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain 
               control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to 
               move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a 
               second number.

               INT. HALLWAY, SCHAEFFER'S HOME  DAY

               Schaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily 
               shocked.

               She calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation.

                                     MRS. SCHAEFFER
                         How are you, John?

               Paul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called 
               away from the Saturday afternoon game.

                                     MRS. SCHAEFFER

                         I'll take it in the study.

               INT. STUDY / STORE  DAY

               Schaeffer takes the phone.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You can hang up, dear.

               We HEAR the click of the other phone,

                                     BOOK
                         You made a mistake, Paul. You 
                         shouldn't have taken Elton out.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (beat)
                         How bad did Mac get you? We figured 
                         pretty bad.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm fine. I'm going to live a long 
                         time. That's what I called to tell 
                         you.

                                     BOOK
                         You might want to pass it along to 
                         Mac.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (urgently)
                         Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're 
                         out there all alone... We're getting 
                         close... real close... Maybe if you 
                         listen to me for a minute we can 
                         work something out so you can come 
                         in 

                                     BOOK
                         I've already got something worked 
                         out.
                              (and)
                         Be seeing you.

               Book hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on 
               Schaeffer.

               Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second 
               to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist 
               his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... 
               Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the 
               situation.

               He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his 
               eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General 
               Store.

               INT. BUGGY  MAIN STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               Book, as Rachel eyes him. She has noticed his changed mood, 
               but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious 
               to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists 
               and traffic.

               EXT. NARROW SIDE STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               The buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards 
               ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road  
               several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped, 
               facing the buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY  DAY

               As Rachel approaches the scene, slowing down and finally 
               stopping.

               Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks 
               at Book.

               Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Do nothing. This happens from time 
                         to time.

               She senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not our way, John. We'll have 
                         nothing to do with violence! John!

               Book shakes free, gets out and slowly walks toward the...

               EXT. HOCHSTETLER'S BUGGY  DAY

               Hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various 
               jeers and taunts from the English lads  various jokes about 
               them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into 
               Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle 
               on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing 
               it to shy. A third notices the slow, sure, approach of John 
               Book.

                                     YOUTH
                         Here comes another one!

               Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth 
               flicks off Book's hat.

                                     BOOK
                              (quietly)
                         You're making a mistake.

               Hochstetler calls from his buggy.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Everything is all right, John.

                                     BOOK
                              (to the youth)
                         Pick up the hat.

               The youth momentarily unsure  something about Book's tone 
               of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps 
               on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A 
               pause, then Book explodes.

               The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he 
               hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth 
               grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into 
               him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. 
               He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. 
               Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd 
               is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book 
               shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a 
               kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction 
               of the Lapp farm.

               The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back 
               to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD 
               LOCAL addresses Rachel.

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         Never seen anything like that in all 
                         my years.

                         He's from... Ohio... My cousin.

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be 
                         different.

                              crow)
                         Our Lancaster brethren, they just 
                         don't have that kind of fight in 
                         them.

                                     RACHEL
                         John, lost control of himself. He... 
                         will be repentant.

                                     LOCAL MAN
                              (to Rachel)
                         You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes. Samuel! We're going.

               A second man calls from the pickup.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         Kid's nose is broken!

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         We'll take him up the hospital. Good-
                         day to you, Mrs. Lapp.
                              (he shouts after her)
                         This ain't good for the tourist trade, 
                         you know! You tell that to your Ohio 
                         cousin!

               But Rachel is already steering past the scene and following 
               the by now distant figure of John Book.

               EXT. BARN / CARPENTER'S SHOP  DUSK

               Book comes out of the carpenter's shop carrying the repaired 
               birdhouse on its pole in one hand, a shovel in the other.

               Rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn.

                                     RACHEL
                         You should not bother with that 
                         birdhouse.
                              (a beat)
                         If you're leaving tomorrow.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm leaving tonight.
                              (and)
                         I'm going to need my clothes. And my 
                         gun.

               She nods, looks away... looks back at him twice in glances. 
               There is a moment when it appears she might either bark at 
               him or begin to weep. He waits. When she does turn to him, 
               she speaks softly:

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I thought you 
                         might have stayed.

                                     BOOK
                              (hesitating... then)
                         There was.

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I would have 
                         welcomed it.

                                     BOOK
                              (after a beat)
                         I know.

                                     RACHEL
                              (asking)
                         I was being foolish?

                                     BOOK
                         No.
                              (and)
                         I was being unrealistic. Even thinking 
                         about living this life.

                                     RACHEL
                         You're so sure of that?

                                     BOOK
                         Aren't you? After today?

                                     RACHEL
                              (almost conceding it, 
                              but... her voice 
                              rising a bit, annoyed)
                         I'm not so sure of anything as you 
                         are, John Book. You could live this 
                         life if you wanted to bad enough.
                              (a beat)

                         Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.

                                     RACHEL
                         There is always a way! But you are 
                         such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot 
                         see! You'd rather go back to that 
                         city! To nothing! No woman! No

                         and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's 
                         what I know and that's what I do!

                                     RACHEL
                         What you do is take vengeance! Which 
                         is a sin against heaven!

                                     RACHEL
                         That's God's way!

                                     BOOK
                         Well in the City of Philadelphia, 
                         God needs a little help!

               He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring 
               himself to make an instant apology. But he's chewing on it 
               when she takes the moment unto herself. She pulls herself 
               up, speaks with great dignity:

                                     RACHEL
                         I could never love a man who was 
                         so... little.

               He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, 
               realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even 
               get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but 
               then does not.

               She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him. 
               she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with 
               some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.

                                     RACHEL
                         The other night... when you saw me 
                         after my bath... I... I tried to 
                         look as I thought you would want a 
                         woman to look.
                              (sadly... but with a 
                              slight, proud lift 
                              of chin)
                         I am sorry... that I did not.

               She holds for an instant, then turns and walks off.

               Looking after her. A face full of loss.

               INT. KITCHEN  DUSK

               Eli is lighting the lamps. Samuel reads a book at the kitchen 
               table. Rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a 
               few dishes. She looks out the window.

               CLOSE on her face, a strange expression.

               The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse.

               INT. KITCHEN

               CLOSE on Rachel's hands, lifting items slowly up and of the 
               water to the draining board, where she places them carefully 
               down. She shakes the water off her hands.

               CLOSE on her face, still staring fixedly out the window. She 
               speaks without turning around.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?

               The old man glances at her; this is not their routine.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY  DUSK

               In the rapidly fading light, Rachel walks slowly toward Book.

               CLOSE on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book.

               ANGLE on Book, CLOSE. He turns and watches Rachel's approach.

               BIG WIDE ANGLE

               The light now nearly gone, the NIGHT SOUNDS beginning, as 
               Rachel reaches Book and they embrace.

               EXT. FIELD BY ROAD  NIGHT

               Book and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still 
               warm earth and make love.

               EXT. SOUDERSBURG CAFE  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               ESTABLISHING an all-night cafe in the early hours of the 
               morning.

               TIGHTENING to the bleakly lighted windows.

               INT. CARE

               A booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster 
               County Undersheriff and his SHERIFF  an expansive politician 
               type  are seated.

               The Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly. The Sheriff has a 
               county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes, 
               pointing directions to Schaeffer:

                                     SHERIFF
                         There... White Oak Road a couple of 
                         miles before it ties into two-twenty-
                         two. Got it?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.

                                     SHERIFF
                         My man Holmes here put it together. 
                         Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the 
                         doctor at the hospital.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked 
                         on the phone.
                              (nods at Holmes)
                         Good work.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Sure you don't want us to post some 
                         backup units?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         If we need any help, we'll give you 
                         a shout. I'd like to slip in there 
                         quiet, then get out before we attract 
                         any attention.

               EXT. CAFE PORCH  DAY

               As Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car. Holmes 
               and the Sheriff watch after them.

                                     HOLMES
                         Maybe I'll take a drive over that 
                         way.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry.

               But Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out.

               EXT. RURAL LANE  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAWN

               With the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon, 
               Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the 
               Lapp driveway and comes to a halt.

               In the b.g. we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings.

               HOLD as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car. 
               They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start TOWARD 
               CAMERA, spreading out as they turn up the long driveway... 
               figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn.

               ANGLE

               GOING WITH the trio of gunmen... McElroy, breath smoking in 
               the chill, eyes the terrain:

                                     MCELROY
                         Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. 
                         What do you figure they plug all 
                         their shit into?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         They don't have any shit.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out... 
               the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table. 
               Rachel is beginning the dishes.

               INT. BARN  DAWN

               Book and Samuel are starting the morning milking...

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the 
               kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons 
               leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer 
               enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Fergie)
                         Outside 

                         Check out the rest of the house.

               He turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room.

               Schaeffer flashes his badge:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         We're police officers. We're looking 
                         for a fugitive, John Book. He's living 
                         here?

                                     ELI
                         I have nothing to say to you. Get 
                         out of my house!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You speak English. Good. Now listen 
                         

                                     RACHEL
                              (recovering)
                         No, you listen. Get out!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lady, I'm here to help you. This man 
                         is very dangerous. An armed criminal.
                              (ingratiating)
                         He's got a gun, hasn't he?

                                     RACHEL
                         You have no right here!

               McElroy re-enters.

                                     MCELROY
                         He's not in this building.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Eli)
                         All right, where is he?

               Suddenly Eli SHOUTS: It's deafening. Probably the loudest 
               noise Eli has ever made:

                                     ELI
                         John Book!

               McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the 
               butt of his shotgun. Eli crumples to the floor. Rachel 
               SCREAMS, runs to Eli.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book and Samuel in the milkhouse. They've heard Eli's outcry. 
               Book moves to the window, looks out.

               BOOK'S POV  FERGIE

               About halfway between the barn and the house. He turns from 
               glancing back toward the house (having heard Eli's shout) 
               and starts again toward the barn. Gun at the ready.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               As Book REACTS.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel kneeling next to Eli, wiping at his bruise with a 
               damp cloth. Schaeffer looks on.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         He'll live.

                                     RACHEL
                         You might have killed him!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to McElroy)
                         Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll 
                         watch these two.

               McElroy nods, moves outside, turns toward the barns.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book still at the window, Samuel now beside him, trying to 
               get a look.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is it them?

                                     BOOK
                              (turning, mind racing)
                         It's them, Sam.
                              (he bends to the boy, 
                              takes him by the 
                              shoulders)
                         Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to 
                         me carefully. Listen to me as you 
                         never listened before.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Are they going to kill you?

                                     BOOK
                         Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go 
                         across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. 
                         Run as fast as you can. And stay 
                         there!

                                     SAMUEL
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BOOK
                         I'll be all right. You just do as I 
                         say.

               He takes Samuel by the hand, leads him to the side door. He 
               bends, holds the boy close.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Don't let them hurt you.

                                     BOOK
                              (rising, pushing Samuel 
                              toward door)
                         I won't. Now run.
                              (as Sam looks back)
                         Fast as you can!

               Sam turns, takes off.

               EXT. REAR DOOR  DAY

               Samuel running.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie almost to the upper barn, McElroy  well back and 
               moving slowly, circumspectly  headed toward the lower barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy 
               heading for the milkhouse door. He can't see Fergie. He turns, 
               crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to 
               the upper barn.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, 
               gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.

               INT. BARN  ANGLE PAST BOOK

               Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie 
               easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind 
               the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside 
               Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm 
               him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's 
               nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes 
               widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.

               DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens 
               the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. 
               Fergie backs off, moves on.

               BOOK

               As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh 
               straw.

               Book eases back alongside Luke, waits.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch.

               BOOK  FLASH CUT

               As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack 
               on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy 
               explode in an horrendous SCREAM.

               FERGIE

               Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies 
               open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under 
               the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering 
               backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the 
               mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into 
               Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half 
               like a matchstick.

               BOOK

               As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the 
               barn.

               FERGIE

               Fallen, skull smashed... and now the dying Luke's legs buckle 
               and he collapses atop Fergie.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound 
               of the shots. Then starting slowly forward.

               On the porch of the house, looking toward the barn.

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               Some distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots, 
               stops dead in his tracks... the sound of the shots still 
               REVERBERATING across the quiet fields.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stricken)
                         Mr. Book?

               He hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the 
               barns.

               EXT. / INT. KITCHEN PORCH  DAY

               Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously 
               toward the barns. Starts out. Schaeffer pushes her back.

               As McElroy, checking the safety on his twelve-gauge, steps 
               into the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy flattens himself against the wall, looks around 
               fearfully.

                                     MCELROY
                              (softly)
                         Fergie?

               Only silence.

               EXT. FRONT PORCH  DAY

               Schaeffer staring toward the barn, SHOUTS:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What the hell happened?

               He listens, hears nothing, snorts, starts toward the barn 
               checking his gun, not hurrying.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Eli now seated at the table, holding a cloth to his head.

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               Samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small 
               muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls, 
               stops short, stares off screen.

               HIS POV  FERGIE

               Where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule, 
               his head crushed like an eggshell.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               As he moves on around Fergie and the dead mule, planting 
               each foot as if he were walking in a mine field.

               BOOK

               Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay 
               mow.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Moving toward the center of the barn.

               BOOK

               As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a 
               rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks 
               up.

               HIS POV  THE ROPE

               It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to 
               the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track 
               that runs the length of the roofbeam. Attached to this trolley 
               is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), U-shaped, sharply-
               pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the 
               floor. The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended 
               in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Keeping one eye on McElroy, he carefully begins to un-tie 
               the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the 
               suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either 
               spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His 
               shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS:

                                     MCELROY
                         Book, you sneaky bastard, I know 
                         you're here! Come out and fight!

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the SOUND OF 
               THE SHOT, wide-eyed. He listens for an-instant, starts a 
               step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large 
               bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. He 
               moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. The bell 
               CLANGS loudly, Sonorously.

               SCHAEFFER

               On the front porch, looking around for the location of the 
               sounding bell. He takes a step toward the barn, the stops, 
               looks back toward the house... frustrated.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book watches as McElroy starts to move again looking back 
               toward the SOUNDING of the bell.

               HIGH ANGLE  HAY FORK

               Looking down we can see McElroy almost directly beneath the 
               hay fork. The bell SOUNDING throughout. BOOK Waiting... trip 
               rope in hand. Then:

                                     BOOK
                              (shouting)
                         Hey, Mac!

               And he lets go the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               As he turns toward the SOUND of Book's voice.

               HAY FORK

               As it plummets down, causing a RATCHETING SOUND that fills 
               the barn, even drowns out the SOUND of the bell.

               MCELROY

               Eyes darting wildly, looking up.

               HIS POV  HAY FORK

               Plunging straight for him.

               MCELROY

               Diving to one side.

               ANGLE  HAY FORK

               THUDDING into the barn floor like a great trident fork.

               Quivering there, not a foot from McElroy's head.

               MCELROY

               Staring at the fork pop-eyed.

               BOOK

               Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in 
               the barn floor just in front of his parked car.

               MCELROY

               Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming, FIRING. 
               The shot smashes the windshield of the car.

               BOOK

               Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing 
               down out of sight.

               MCELROY

               FIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he 
               begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder. 
               The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY 
               POPS UP.

               ANGLE

               As McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, FIRES 
               twice.

               MCELROY'S POV  LAPP BUGGY

               The buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is 
               Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of 
               the rockerarm.

               He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of 
               his head, his face set against the tears that move down his 
               cheeks.

               SCHAEFFER

               Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward 
               the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward 
               the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. 
               He still can't see Samuel.

               HIS POV  THE PORCH

               As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, SHOUTING:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You stay put!

               RACHEL

               She stops. She is also unable to see Samuel.

               SCHAEFFER

               Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there 
               is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him.

               EXT. FIELDS  DAY

               Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, 
               Stotlzfus and others  including Hochstetler and his brothers 
                are baling the first cutting of June hay.

               But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in 
               toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the 
               Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.

               But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward 
               Samuel.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Cut that out!

               Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.

               Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of 
               the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs 
               on grimly.

               Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves 
               him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun 
               blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several 
               threads, so he FIRES again.

               The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to 
               look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when 
               Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy 
               kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness 
               right then and there.

               But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He 
               SNARLS at Sam:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get down to the house and stay there!

               Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.

               RACHEL

               Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in 
               her arms... then to lead him back toward the house.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. Then easing 
               over, placing his feet on the rungs.

               BOOK

               He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The 
               cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks 
               at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops 
               at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering 
               the rungs.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He turns now to a door at the back of the pen. He un-hooks 
               it, pulls it open, moves inside.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to 
               a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) 
               rises to the top of the structure.

               Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that 
               Book's been here before, expects what he sees.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond 
               it into the silo. There is about two feet of old silage 
               covering the floor. He turns, looks up the white walls.

               HIS POV  INSIDE SILO

               An inside ladder runs to the top.

               HIS POV  KICKBOARD

               Standing against the wall next to the entrance... . obviously 
               to be inserted as the silo is filled.

               BOOK

               Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses 
               to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other 
               direction (toward the milkhouse).

               BACK TO BOOK

               Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward 
               into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book 
               immediately turns, darts back into the silo.

               MCELROY

               Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his 
               eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow 
               half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. 
               McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table.

                                     ELI
                         Praise Gott!

               Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and 
               hard.

               She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big 
               family Bible. He crosses to the table, sets the book down, 
               places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him.

               Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man 
               helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, 
               takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of 
               the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out 
               how to open the chamber to load it.

               In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he 
               rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.

                                     ELI
                              (fiercely)
                         No, Rachel...

                                     RACHEL
                         I have to help him!

               Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try 
               to load the bullets. Eli's callused hand closes over hers, 
               halting the action:

                                     ELI
                         It is not our way!

               Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling 
               fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.

               A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers 
               release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes 
               her eyes.

               Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli 
               and Rachel silently.

               Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible 
               beneath his. They stand there and they pray.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance.

               MCELROY

               Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the 
               cowflops.

               The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly. 
               McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door. 
               As he arrives, he HEARS a noise  very slight  from the 
               direction of the silo.

               He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, 
               He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base 
               of the inner ladder, looks up.

               HIS POV  THE HATCH

               The patch of blue sky, forty feet up.

               Schaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, MUTTERS, CURSES 
               under his breath. Then he rounds the corner of the first 
               stall... and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of 
               him. Schaeffer stares, blinks... moves on spotting a spent 
               shotgun shell near the hayfork...

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book listening at the kickboard. SOUNDS of feet, shotgun 
               rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on 
               his side, starts silently up.

               MCELROY

               Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand.

               BOOK

               He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the 
               distance to the floor, starts upward again.

               The Amish beginning to arrive. Sam comes running, pulls 
               Stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other Amish 
               look at the shot-shattered bellrope. Rachel and Eli come 
               rapidly up the path toward the group.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the 
               ladder, looks down. He sets his shotgun down, takes out his 
               service revolver, starts down.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from 
               the ground. He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold 
               it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one 
               side as best he can... hangs there, listening.

               MCELROY

               Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard.

               BOOK

               Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side 
               of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, 
               raps on the board smartly once.

               MCELROY

               Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the 
               back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts 
               the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.

               BOOK

               We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, 
               with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it 
               to the floor.

               McELROY  FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling 
               forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book 
               seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and 
               GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy 
               manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet 
               to the bottom of the silo.

               BOOK

               He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies 
               stunned.

               MCELROY

               His forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head 
               bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he 
               falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as...

               TIGHT ON BOOK

               Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, 
               into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle 
               is placed firmly against Book's temple.

               WIDER

               Schaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as 
               if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a 
               SOUND behind him. He snaps around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening 
               (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the 
               shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on 
               as:

               SCHAEFFER

               He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Okay, Johnny. On your feet.

               THE SCENE

               As Book struggles to his feet  Schaeffer holding the pistol 
               tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, 
               blinks.

               Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward 
               Samuel, he speaks quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's okay, Sam.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway 
               toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in 
               at the inert McElroy) follow and...

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge 
               into the barnyard. Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol 
               pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw.

               Schaeffer pulls up, frowning:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Hold it.

               WHAT HE SEES

               The Amishmen gathered  the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler 
               brothers, et al. All staring hard at Schaeffer and Book.

               EXT. BARN / DRIVE  DAY

               From a high wide angle the final scene is played out. 
               Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive, 
               the Amish following along closely on both sides.

               CLOSE ON BOOK

               As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get back, you people!
                              (prodding)
                         Keep moving, Johnny...

               Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. 
               The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book 
               now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.

                                     BOOK
                         You're going to have to do it right 
                         here, Schaeffer.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Don't try me, Johnny!

               Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.

                                     ELI
                         So... will you kill us all, then?

               ANGLE

               As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly 
               turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled  
               and almost pressing against  Book's chest. Book locks eyes 
               with Schaeffer.

               Quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's all over, Paul.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Move! Or you die right here!

               Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand 
               wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun 
               falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force 
               of Book's grip.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes 
               him away. Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who  partly 
               to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to 
               congratulate him on his surrender  wraps one brawny arm 
               around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving 
               nod... holds Schaeffer as:

               BOOK

               Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes 
               meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read 
               resignation... whatever there was between them has been 
               terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               HIGH SHOT holding the moment.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LATE AFTERNOON

               The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange 
               in his working suit. He looks about him, sees Samuel down by 
               the pond.

               EXT. POND

               He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Are you really ever coming back?

                                     BOOK
                         Got to, Sam. You and I are going to 
                         a courthouse together, put some people 
                         behind bars.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Have you got your gun on now?

                                     BOOK
                         Sure have, Sam.

               Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.

               EXT. HOUSE  DAY

               Book opens the door of the car, turns to find Rachel standing 
               there with his Amish hat in hand.

                                     RACHEL
                         I want you to take this... to remember 
                         by.

                                     BOOK
                         Where's my baggy pants?

                                     RACHEL
                         Here. Whenever you want them.

               He wants to kiss her, but does not. Their eyes say it all. 
               Eli has a final word, SHOUTING from the porch.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful, John Book! Out among 
                         them English!

               Book gets quickly into the car.

               INT. /EXT. DRIVEWAY  LAPP FARM  DAY

               As Book drives, he sees an open buggy coming down the hill 
               toward the farm, He slows as he passes, It's Daniel 
               Hochstetler. A long beat, and as they pass, Hochstetler gives 
               Book an expansive tip of his hat.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR

               Book turns to look back at his rival, a doubt in his eyes.

               TITLE SEQUENCE

               The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, 
               as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND 
               TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The 
               CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, 
               then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar 
               faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are 
               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               Through the last traces of early morning mist another group 
               of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the 
               landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.

               Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern 
               figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, 
               his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired 
               like his father, peering out.

               The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS 
               on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES 
               on the pavement.

               ANOTHER LANE

               Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of 
               three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a 
               leafless thicket of hickory.

               VALLEY

               A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen 
               buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.

               BARNYARD

               Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses 
               have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of 
               the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  FRONT PORCH

               As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women 
               and children presumably first).

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse 
               has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen 
               partially covering the bearded face.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of 
               the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred-
               fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows 
               of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the 
               f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy 
               a special Place.

               RACHEL LAPP

               A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and 
               drawn.

               In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too 
               many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual 
               woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.

               Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would 
               appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.

               And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered  yet 
               not unkind  features grief-stricken.

               THE MOURNERS

               Their faces...

               CLOCK

               As it begins to CHIME nine a.m.

               FAVORING PREACHER

               As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation 
               remove their hats also.

               Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     PREACHER
                         ...a brother has been called home. 
                         God has spoken through the death of 
                         our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

               THE FAMILY

               Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion 
               and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:

                                     PREACHER
                         ...husband of Rachel, father to 
                         Samuel, son of Eli.
                              (and)
                         His chair is empty, his bed is empty, 
                         his voice will be heard no more. He 
                         was needed in our presence, but God 
                         needs such men, too. That one should 
                         be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. 
                         Still, we would not wish him back. 
                         Rather we should prepare ourselves 
                         to follow him.

               TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in 
               silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the 
               pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.

               As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the 
               grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a 
               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty 
               air.

               RACHEL

               TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post 
               funeral, midday meals.

               Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of 
               soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, 
               preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.

               DANIEL HOCHSTETLER

               A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. 
               There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic 
               set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly 
               what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up 
               man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group 
               of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, 
               BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.

                         Lapp was a good farmer. None better.

                         But not the man to buy a horse for 
                         you.
                              (and)
                         Hochstetler, wasn't it your father 
                         sold him that horse with a ruptured 
                         testicle?

                                     TOM
                              (grins)
                         Told him it was a bee sting made him 
                         limp that way.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (amused)
                         That horse had one good ball. That's 
                         all it takes.

               The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on 
               Rachel.

               RACHEL

               As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a 
               tree in front of her.

               At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. 
               All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, 
               tune in as Rachel looks up.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let 
                         us hope he walks close with God.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sure he does, Daniel.

               FIELDS, LAPP FARM  DAY

               It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is 
               hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The 
               death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three  
               Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli 
               work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up 
               from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach  
               it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a 
               word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various 
               tasks associated with the work in hand.

               Daniel works close beside Rachel.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROADS, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family 
               take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the 
               reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad, 
               to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a 
               chance to cross a busy interstate highway.

               EXT. HIGHWAY, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it 
               trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a 
               procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to 
               overtake it.

               EXT. PLATFORM, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, 
               Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming 
               to her cheek.

                                     RACHEL
                         Daniel?

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I... I was at the feed store. And I 
                         saw your horse, so...

               There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival 
               of the train.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         You will come back soon?

               Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his 
               mother's hand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Quickly, Mother Quickly!

               Rachel embraces Eli.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful out among them English.

               She turns to Hochstetler.

                                     RACHEL
                         I need time, Daniel.

               EXT. CARPARK, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open 
               wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his 
               horse off at a fast trot.

               EXT. TRAIN  DAY

               The ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly 
               forward.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               As Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him 
               to light up.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Look, Mama...!

               HIS POV THROUGH WINDOW

               A road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in 
               his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts 
               to keep pace with the train.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see, darling.

               And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he 
               can.

               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

               The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted 
               with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish 
               farmers working their horse-drawn equipment.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               As the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares 
               raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the 
               countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot 
               air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he 
               looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to 
               suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots 
               and fast food outlets.

               EXT. PHILADELPHIA SLUMS

               As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets 
               choked with cars and the gutters with filth.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, 
               almost apprehension:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is this where we're going?

                                     RACHEL
                         Of course not. We're going to 
                         Baltimore. It's much nicer in 
                         Baltimore.

               And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the 
               window.

               INT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress 
               of the two Amish  particularly Samuel's black coat and hat 
                are drawing curious stares.

               SAMUEL

               He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a 
               little girl about his own age, standing in line with her 
               parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother...

               ANGLE

               As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock 
               coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, 
               from appearances, be an Amishman.

               Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we 
               discover that he is a Hasidic Jew.

               SAMUEL

               As he reacts.

               BACK TO TICKET COUNTER

               As Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and 
               she shows him her ticket.

                                     RACHEL
                         We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where 
                         is that train, please?

                                     TICKET SELLER
                         Delayed three hours. You'll hear an 
                         announcement when it's time to board.

               He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and 
               puts it on his head.

               ANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM

               As Samuel enters.

               It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops 
               before one of the urinals  a long, trough-like affair with 
               water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.

               It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING 
               FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel 
               stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, 
               stoops to see which are empty.

               HIS POV  TOILETS

               Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel 
               is alone in the restroom.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a 
               stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily 
               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, 
               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind 
               a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.

               Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large 
               BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. 
               His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and 
               a short leather jacket.

               They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.

               The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for 
               him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close 
               confines of the lavatory.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he 
               can see their feet under the edge of the door.

               BACK TO FIGHT

               As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young 
               man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.

               The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's 
               hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've 
               accomplished with a stunned expression:

                                     PARTNER
                         Jesus...

               The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with 
               blood.

               He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his 
               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. 
               Then he collapses to the floor.

               The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, 
               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind 
               the dispenser.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder 
               we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the 
               backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we 
               catch sight of the black man's face.

               SAMUEL

               As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes 
               the stall door.

               ANGLE IN STALL

               Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and 
               won't fall closed.

               BLACK MAN

               As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. 
               His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.

               The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, 
               glances at the row of stalls.

               HIS POV  STALLS

               All quiet, but...

               BACK TO SCENE

               The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting 
               at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on 
               the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.

               BLACK MAN

               He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.

               BLACK MAN

               As he gives the door a kick. It holds. He swears under his 
               breath.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of... 
               he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the 
               black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the 
               process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just 
               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that 
               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's 
               framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking 
               down our throats.

               ANGLE

               As his partner snaps from the doorway:

                                     PARTNER
                         Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!

               A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to 
               follow the partner out.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory. A 
               long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack.

               HIS POW THROUGH DOOR

               Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror... 
               then PANNING DOWN to the still figure of the young man lying 
               in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.

               BENCH WAITING ROOM  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT

               Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes 
               staring.

               Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various 
               police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally 
               obscuring the lonely couple. There is considerable ECHOING 
               NOISE as commands and requests mingle with the CRACKLE OF 
               TWO-WAY RADIOS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOOR  MEN'S' ROOM

               The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the 
               Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, 
               who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the 
               crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with 
               a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black 
               partner  about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing 
               a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably  
               dressed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BENCH

               Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as 
               Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN.

                                     BOOK
                         You found the body?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported 
                         it. It was the kid.

                                     BOOK
                         What kid?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         How'n hell do I know what kid? The 
                         kid in the funny black threads.

               TIGHT SHOT  SAMUEL

               Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move 
               suddenly to his left.

               BOOK'S LEGS  SAMUEL'S POV

               Coming in at full stride, then stopping.

               SAMUEL

               He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, 
               slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's 
               belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his 
               face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then...

               ANGLE  BOOK

               As his face breaks into a big grin, and...

                                     BOOK
                         Hi, kid.

               RACHEL

               Immediately alarmed, intervening.

                                     RACHEL
                         What do you want of my son?

               THE SCENE

               As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield.

                         I'm a police officer. I'm going to 
                         have to talk to the boy. What's his 
                         name?

                         But what happened here is none of 
                         his affair. My sister is expecting 
                         me... our train is leaving soon.

                         The man who was killed tonight was a 
                         policeman, Sam. It's my job to find 
                         out who did it. I want you to tell 
                         me everything you saw when you went 
                         in there.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stammers)
                         I saw him.

                                     SAMUEL
                         No... I saw the man who killed him.

               Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to 
               Carter.

                         I didn't even know about it.

                         Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he 
                         looked like?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (groping, touching 
                              his clothes and 
                              pointing at Carter)
                         He was... like him.

                         Black... I understand. What else,Sam?

               A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather 
               slightly built partner:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Not Zwartich, like him 

               Book frowns, puzzled:

                                     BOOK
                         Try that one again, Sam 

               Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel 
               intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:

                                     RACHEL
                         May I talk to you?

               ANGLE

               As Rachel takes Book aside, and in a low voice:

                                     RACHEL
                         Zwartich. It's the way we say... 
                         dwarf.
                              (glances at Carter)
                         Not like him... very big.

               Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion 
               off screen catches his attention.

               BOOK'S POV  ONCOMING COPS

               It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past 
               the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off 
               reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's 
               got in tow:

               BACK TO SCENE

               AS DONAHUE COMES ON BOOK:

                                     DONAHUE
                              (to aides)
                         Close it all down... I want a man on 
                         every exit... I want the lab in here 
                         now!
                              (to Book)
                         And I want to talk to you, Captain.

               ANGLE

               As Book steps aside with Donahue... In the b.g. Rachel moves 
               protectively to Samuel's side.

                                     BOOK
                         All right, talk. 

                                     DONAHUE
                         This is homicide  not Internal 
                         Affairs! So why are you behaving 
                         like you own this case?

                         We were running Zenovitch... That's 
                         all I can tell you. But I want it, 
                         Terry.
                              (then)
                         I've got a call into Schaeffer.

               RACHEL / SAMUEL

               They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue 
               and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's 
               obviously intense and angry:

                                     SAMUEL
                              (alarmed)
                         Momma... are they angry with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (reassuring, but hardly 
                              in her own mind)
                         No... No. It is just the English 
                         way.

               Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:

                                     DONAHUE
                         You ought to think about coming back 
                         to Homicide, Johnny... Stick with 
                         Internal Affairs and you're not gonna 
                         have any friends left.

               EXT. 30TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses 
               to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit 
               in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and 
               opens the door.

                                     BOOK
                         Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.

               The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside 
               him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. SEDAN

               Book sits next to SCHAEFFER, a surprisingly kindly looking 
               man of about fifty. Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What have you got?

                         Zenovitch was about to deliver a 
                         list of names tonight  street 
                         chemists... the guys processing this 
                         P2P into speed.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         So one of them got to him.

                         That's the problem. We need results. 
                         The press is driving us crazy over 
                         this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed 
                         capitol of the country'. You know 
                         the sort of thing. It's getting

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between 
               neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened 
               storefronts.

               Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat 
               looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters 
               huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the 
               POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST 
               EVERY FEW MINUTES.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not a joke.

               Book decides to try contrition:

                                     BOOK
                         You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, 
                         I know a little about the Amish. I 
                         know this has to be an ordeal for 
                         you; and I'm really sorry you an 
                         Samuel got involved.

               Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his 
               mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book 
               frowns.

                                     BOOK
                         What was that?

                                     RACHEL
                         He wants to know who you are. Your 
                         name. I told him we don't need to 
                         know anything about you.

               Book eyes Samuel:

               EXT. 13TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened 
               little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's 
               side window.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR  NIGHT

               Book lowers the window.

                         Sammy, where's Coalmine?

               The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the 
               back seat.

                                     SAMMY
                         What you got there, the Salvation 
                         Army?

                         Try "Happy Valley".

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY BAR, SOUTH STREET  NIGHT

               Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get 
               out, and move swiftly inside.

               INT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on 
               the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and 
               move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this 
               point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've 
               approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did 
               the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their 
               move...

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, 
               violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see 
               Coalmine is not the killer.

               As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police 
               squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. 
               An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's 
               face down next to the car window.

                                     BOOK
                         Put some light on him.

               A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over 
               Coalmine's face.

                                     BOOK
                              (continuing; to Samuel)
                         Look at him.

               Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at 
               Samuel inside the car:

               Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.

               Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and 
               slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing 
               his face up against the front window. His face takes on a 
               grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his 
               partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away 
               by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has 
               horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he 
               gets back in the car.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, you listen to me! I will 
                         have no further part in this, nor 
                         will my son! As God stands between 
                         us!

               Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off.

               EXT. HOTEL  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN 
               moves to open the rear door.

               INT. CAR  NIGHT

               Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is 
               puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Ma'am?

                         No! We do not stay in hotels.

               Book and Carter exchange a glance.

               EXT. / INT. FRONT DOOR, SUBURBAN HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  
               NIGHT

               An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers 
               stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house. 
               This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to 
               follow Rachel inside.

                                     ELAINE
                         How could you do this to me tonight? 
                         I told you I had company

                         Sorry. It's important.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she glances in a doorway.

               HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN

               It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the 
               table littered with empty beer cans.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she hustles Samuel along.

               BOOK / ELAINE

                         Oh sure, Fred.

               Elaine looks like she's going to blow again, then decides 
               it's pointless.

                                     ELAINE

               ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM

               Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.

               Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the 
               other one.

               Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A 
               beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.

                                     ELAINE
                         Everything okay?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes, thank you very much.

                                     ELAINE
                              (a beat)
                         John said you're Amish.

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes.

                              (blankly)
                         Oh.

               She nods and goes.

               Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up 
               at her bleakly.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I don't want to stay here.

                         They are English. They don't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I wish dawdie was with us.

                         I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.

               She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she 
               frowns, and...

               EXT. DRIVE-IN FAST-FOOD JOINT  PHILADELPHIA  DAWN

               Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple 
               of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into 
               the car.

               Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut. 
               Its clear they've worked through the night.

               EXT. ELAINE'S HOUSE  DAY

               Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces, 
               which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street.

               INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE

               As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt, 
               turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.

               ANGLE

               But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and 
               FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine 
               gasps, Fred manages to grunt.

                                     FRED
                         Wrong door, kid.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Samuel quickly shuts the door. A straight-faced beat; 
               then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               As Rachel appears in the living room entry. Samuel is sitting 
               on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching 
               television.

               They're eating cold cereal out of a box.

               RACHEL'S POV  TV SCREEN

               Some artless Saturday morning cartoon.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring 
               hypnotically. And...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily, 
               appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.

               HER POV  KIDS

               Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows 
               while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. The TV is 
               off.

               BACK TO ELAINE

               As she stares.

               ANGLE IN KITCHEN

               Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen 
               finishing a brisk mop of the floor. The coffee is perking. 
               Elaine appears.

                                     ELAINE
                              (mutters)
                         Jesus...

               Rachel turns cheerily.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good morning.

                                     ELAINE
                              (helplessly)
                         You didn't have to...

                                     RACHEL
                         I wanted to. you were kind to take 
                         us in last night.
                              (and)
                         Anyway, I needed something to do. I 
                         was so angry with your brother. He's 
                         so... agaanisish!

                                     ELAINE
                         Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like 
                         John.

               She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         Just a minute. I'll pour you some 
                         coffee.

                                     ELAINE
                         You're not carrying a bullwhip... 
                         how'd you manage to put my kids to 
                         work?

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         I made it a contest... the one who 
                         does best gets his cereal back first.
                              (and)
                         Children like to help... they only 
                         need to be kept after a little bit.

               Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to 
               storm.

                                     ELAINE
                         Oh, is that so?
                              (and)
                         No offense, lady, but I'm not so 
                         sure I like the idea of your coming 
                         in here and turning the place upside 
                         down!

               Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, I didn't mean...

               Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's 
               hands.

               She mops furiously as she Continues:

                                     ELAINE
                         I know exactly what you meant! Listen, 
                         maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, 
                         but maybe I don't have time to polish 
                         the goddamn china and keep after the 
                         kids!
                              (and)
                         It's none of your business, but I 
                         don't happen to have a man around 
                         here full time. So I sell cosmetics 
                         in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes 
                         I can even pay the rent on time! So 
                         maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe 
                         I don't need to have it jammed down 
                         my throat like this.

               She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:

                                     ELAINE
                         There is that clean enough for you?

               Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting 
               into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his 
               undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.

                                     FRED
                         Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and 
                         leave you a broom?

               Not a politic observation on Fred's part.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blurts)
                         Go to hell, Fred!

               And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares 
               after her.

                                     FRED
                         What's bugging her?

               Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, 
               letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.

               INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

               As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door 
               behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.

                                     RACHEL
                         I brought your coffee.

               She takes a seat next to the bed.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that 
                         way.

               After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:

                                     ELAINE
                         It's okay.
                              (and)
                         Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. 
                         It's like... somehow... I've let 
                         everything get away from me. And you 
                         sort of made me face it.

               She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private 
               thought.

                                     ELAINE
                         What's so funny?

                                     RACHEL
                         Fred. The way he looked when you 
                         screamed at him.

                                     ELAINE
                              (disparing)
                         God, Fred...

                                     RACHEL
                         At home you'd never hear a woman 
                         scream at a man that way.

                                     ELAINE
                         No? Why not?

                                     RACHEL
                         You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish 
                         way.
                              (then)
                         But I think it would have done me 
                         good if I could have screamed at 
                         your brother last night.

                                     ELAINE
                         Listen, I don't know what's going on 
                         or how you got mixed up with him, 
                         but don't you let that self-righteous 
                         son of a bitch push you around, okay?

               Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Okay.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Book glances irritably at Rachel:

                                     BOOK
                         Now what's the problem?

                                     RACHEL
                         The problem is I don't happen to 
                         think my son should be spending all 
                         his time with a man who carried a 
                         gun under his coat and goes around 
                         whacking people.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Whacking?

                                     RACHEL
                              (firmly)
                         Yes. And I also want to leave this 
                         city.

                                     BOOK
                         Believe me, I'm trying to get this 
                         over with as fast as I can. But Samuel 
                         will probably have to come back and 
                         testify.

                                     RACHEL
                         We do not go into your courts.

                                     BOOK
                         People who don't go into our courts 
                         when they're told to sometimes go 
                         directly into our jail.

               Rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly 
               note for a beat.

                                     BOOK
                         Look, I'm genuinely sorry...

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         No you're not 
                              (off his look)
                         You're glad, because now you've got 
                         a witness.
                              (and)
                         I heard the other police talking 
                         last night.
                              (and)
                         They don't seem to like you very 
                         much.

                                     BOOK
                         They kid a lot.

                                     RACHEL
                              (glances at him)
                         I would not be too sure.

               Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something 
               to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.

                                     RACHEL
                         He says you look very tired. I thought 
                         the same thing.

               Book says nothing.

                                     RACHEL
                         But not a good tired.

                                     BOOK
                         What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.

               She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into 
               his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility.

               INT. IDENTIFICATION ROOM  POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They 
               are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. 
               Samuel shakes his head  another negative.

               Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow 
               gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an 
               inquiring look. It's a peace offering.

               Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just 
               as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches 
               over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at 
               Samuel.

                                     BOOK
                              (to Rachel)
                         Just wanted to see if you were on 
                         your toes.

               EXT. CITY PARK  DAY

               Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of 
               hot dogs heaped with kraut.

               Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch. 
               Rachel eyes him a beat. then:

                                     RACHEL
                         Your sister said you don't have a 
                         family?

                                     BOOK
                         No.

                                     RACHEL
                         She thinks you should get married 
                         and have children of your own. Instead 
                         of trying to be a father to hers. 
                         Except she thinks you're afraid of 
                         the responsibility.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Oh? Anything else?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes. She thinks you like policing 
                         because you think you're right about 
                         everything. And you're the only one 
                         who can do anything. And that when 
                         you drink a lot of beer you say things 
                         like none of the other police would 
                         know a crook from a... um... bag of 
                         elbows.

               Book is staring at her. Rachel nods.

                                     RACHEL
                         I think that's what she said.

               Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing 
               looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles 
               proudly.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good appetite.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUTER OFFICE/WAITING ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Rachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police 
               clerks eyeing her curiously. A sign on the desk reads 
               "Narcotics Division."

               Rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially 
               open door.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION, POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               A group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid 
               conversation by the opening of the main office door. They 
               stare in considerable surprise.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOHN BOOK

               Standing in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand.

                                     BOOK
                         Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you 
                         to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a 
                         little help.

               INT. SMALL OFFICE, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               A Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several 
               volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a 
               similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on 
               the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.

               The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously  
               internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the 
               working policemen in any department.

                                     KAMAN
                         There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone 
                         for you.

               Book gets up and moves to the door.

                                     KAMAN
                         And, Captain, don't want to rush 
                         you, but I'm gonna need these files 
                         back in a half hour. We got a lot of 
                         work to do round here.

               The two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his 
               perch and following the direction taken by Book.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in 
               a cubicle of an office.

               Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the 
               bustle of the squadroom.

               He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques 
               and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of 
               outstanding duty and achievement.

               ANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE

               As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes 
               are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.

               Until suddenly he freezes.

               SAMUEL'S POV  NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT

               Enlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: "Division 
               Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project". Accompanying the 
               item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy  clearly the 
               black man who murdered the young cop in the train station 
               men's room.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               He stares, transfixed.

               A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to 
               Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.

               He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that 
               they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to 
               point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small 
               hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. 
               He smiles gently at the boy.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  PHILADELPHIA  DUSK

               Rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding 
               Samuel close. Book glances at her:

                                     RACHEL
                         Why don't you arrest that man? Are 
                         you protecting him because policeman?

                                     BOOK
                              (snaps)
                         Listen, I'm the cop that polices the 
                         police. I'm not in the business of 
                         protecting crooked cops.
                              (eases up)
                         I'll make an arrest when I know 
                         everybody involved.

               Rachel shakes her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         But why would they murder...

                                     BOOK
                         Because  somehow  they knew I was 
                         getting close.
                              (and)
                         Look, it's narcotics... They make 
                         dope out of chemicals... they sell 
                         it on the street for millions of 
                         dollars. They'll do anything.
                              (and)
                         And they can get away with it because 
                         they're cops.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat, then)
                         I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I 
                         want to go home.

                                     BOOK
                         You'll be safe. You don't have to 
                         worry.

               She says nothing.

               Another beat, then:

                                     BOOK
                         Look, they're thinking as long as 
                         they keep the killer out of Samuel's 
                         way, we can't make an I.D. There's 
                         no way they can know Samuel saw that 
                         photograph, so he's safe.

               He glances at her, but she continues ahead.

                                     BOOK
                         I mean it. You will be safe.

               Suddenly Rachel explodes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we 
                         feel safe in a city where the police 
                         are so busy killing each other!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. SCHAEFFER HOME, PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS  NIGHT

               The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is 
               opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised 
               and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY 
               is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed 
               inside.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S STUDY  NIGHT

               Schaeffer passes Book a drink.

               Book is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase, 
               closing on his quarry:

                                     BOOK
                         It was McElroy, Paul.

               Schaeffer gives him a sharp look:

                                     BOOK
                         Last guy I would have figured. But 
                         he's part of it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I hope you don't have any doubts 
                         about that.

                                     BOOK
                         If I did, I'd have kept my mouth 
                         shut...
                              (and)
                         It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons 
                         of P2P confiscated four years ago... 
                         Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.
                              (excited, explaining 
                              the thing eagerly)
                         He salts it away somewhere... he 
                         knows the stuff is potent, but the 
                         street chemists haven't figured out 
                         how to process it. But they do now.
                              (and)
                         And now the stuff is worth five-grand 
                         a pint and there are a lot of pints 
                         in a fifty-five gallon drum.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (beat)
                         Who else knows?

                                     BOOK
                         Just us.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (shakes his head)
                         Okay, what are you going to need to 
                         clean it up

                                     BOOK
                         More people... Gotta pick up where 
                         Zenovich left off. People from outside 
                         the department.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (nods)
                         Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards 
                         at Treasury. I'll take care of it.
                              (then)
                         I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut 
                         their balls off for me. I'm counting 
                         on you.

               Schaeffer pours himself another drink.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What's your first move?

                                     BOOK
                              (expels a breath)
                         A hot shower... I haven't changed 
                         clothes in two days.

               EXT. PARKING LOT  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being 
               locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports 
               section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward 
               his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports 
               section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts 
               to take a step... and looks up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the 
               other side of the parking lot crosswalk

               BACK TO BOOK

               Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.

               MCELROY

               Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping 
               bag (which he appeared to be carrying)  letting the shopping 
               bag fall away as he does so  revealing a five-inch barrel 
               Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. 
               Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES 
               once.

               BOOK

               Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven 
               into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:

               MCELROY

               Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a 
               WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. 
               And McElroy still smiling as:

               BOOK

               Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send 
               Book down hard and grasping.

               MCELROY

               Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely 
               taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book 
               toward McElroy.

               He smiles at them.

               BOOK

               Down, muttering CURSES.

               THE SCENE

               As McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement, 
               keeps on going... and is gone.

               BOOK

               GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And 
               we HEAR  from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream.

                                     SCHAEFFER (V.O.)
                         Who else knows?

                                     BOOK (V.O.)
                         Just us.

               As the lights of an oncoming car  going very slowly, on its 
               way to a parking space  sweep over him and we HEAR it come 
               to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get 
               to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, 
               using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car 
               door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, 
               accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the 
               oncomers,

               ANGLE

               A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of 
               Book, looks on edgily:

                                     MAN
                         Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little 
                         too much to drink?

               Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.

               BOOK'S WOUND

               As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck 
               him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other 
               just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).

               THE SCENE

               As the man stares:

                                     MAN
                         Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a 
                         hospital!
                              (and)
                         Here; I'll give you a hand.

               He starts to approach, but Book shoves him away.

                                     BOOK
                         No! No hospital!

               By now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance:

                                     WIFE
                         Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to 
                         die in the street, that's his 
                         business!

               But the man is not content:

                                     MAN
                         Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at 
                         that blood?

               Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to 
               intercept him:

                                     MAN
                         Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed 
                         to death!

               Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed 
               squarely at the fat man's face:

                                     MAN
                         Shit!

                                     WIFE
                              (quavering)
                         I told you, Henry!

               Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is 
               sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at 
               the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back 
               toward his car.

               EXT. STREET  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               As Book's car wheels somewhat erratically through traffic.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               Book has a gym bag open on the seat next to him, is stuffing 
               a tshirt under his belt to staunch the blood. And...

               INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT  BEDROOM  NIGHT

               As he's awakened by the RINGING bedside telephone. He snaps 
               on a lamp... He's instantly awake, not unused to such rousing 
               in the wee hours. A woman sleeps beside him.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah...

               INTERCUT BOOK

               He's at an n.d. pay phone.

                                     BOOK
                         Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish 
                         woman's name and address on my desk 
                         calendar, I want you to lose it for 
                         me, Now. Tonight.

                                     CARTER
                         What the hell are you talking about?
                         What's happening.

                                     BOOK
                         Nothing. I'm not going to be around 
                         for a while. I'll call you when I 
                         can.

                                     CARTER
                              (alarmed)
                         Johnny, what the fuck?

                                     BOOK
                              (hard)
                         Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of 
                         it. Maybe at the top of it.

               There's a stunned silence at the other end.

                                     BOOK
                         Yeah... I can put it all together 
                         when I get back, 'Til then, you know

               INT. GUEST ROOM, ELAINE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               As the door opens and Elaine switches on the light, rousing 
               Rachel. Elaine looks haggard.

                                     ELAINE
                         It's John. He says you have to leave 
                         now. He says it's urgent.

               She leaves the room as Rachel instantly awake, moves quickly 
               to rouse Samuel.

               EXT. BATHROOM DOOR

               Elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions 
               from her brother. From inside we hear the SOUND OF RUNNING 
               WATER. Elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency.

                                     BOOK (V.O.)
                         Put my car in the garage and close 
                         the door.

                                     ELAINE
                         John, I don't understand any of this.

                                     BOOK (V.O.)
                              (snaps)
                         You don't know anything... borrowed 
                         your car. Didn't say why. And you 
                         never heard of that woman and her 
                         boy.

                                     ELAINE
                         John, why?...

                                     BOOK
                              (shouts)
                         Just do it!

               INT. BATHROOM

               Book looks at himself in the mirror, his face is pale and 
               drawn.

               He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his 
               right side, just under the rib cage. The wound continues to 
               bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting 
               his shirt back on.

               He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin 
               with tissues which he flushes down the toilet.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               As he drives across town. Samuel is curled up asleep, his 
               head on Rachel's lap.

                                     RACHEL
                         Where are you taking us now?

                         You couldn't wait until morning?

               Book gives her a look.

                              (insistent)
                         What happened?

               But Book, glancing in his rearview mirror, tenses.

               HIS POV  MIRROR

               In it we can see a police car coming on fast, with lights 
               and SIREN.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel eyes Book warily.

               A beat, then the police car WAILS past. Book expels a breath.

                                     RACHEL

               Rachel looks away, speaks almost sarcastically, MUTTERING.

               ANGLE PAST Book's desk calendar. Carter enters in the b.g., 
               crosses quickly to the desk. He snaps on a light, thumbs a 
               page of the calendar. Frowns.

               A couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to 
               give him a look. Meets their eyes. They move on.

               Carter shakes it off, goes. And...

               As light colors the eastern horizon, Book is crossing into 
               Lancaster County.

               Book glances at Rachel; she's asleep. He coughs wrackingly, 
               hurting... cinches the belt of his overcoat even tighter. 
               And...

               HIS POV  BOOK'S CAR

               Coming up the long drive.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As the car pulls up in the barnyard and Eli crosses to it.

               Suddenly the car door flies open and Samuel jumps out, races 
               across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man.

               ANGLE AT CAR

               As Rachel steps out of the passenger's side, Book remains 
               seated.

               He lets his eyes travel around the farm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make 
                         coffee and breakfast.

                         What about Samuel? Will you come 
                         back to take him to trial?

               Book starts the engine:

                                     BOOK
                              (grimly)
                         There isn't going to be one.

               Rachel stares at him, not sure what he means. Then backs 
               away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around 
               in the barnyard.

               ANGLE

               As Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel.

                         His name is John Book.

               Eli is about to inquire further when Samuel cries:

                         Momma  look.

               They glance in the direction Samuel is looking.

               THEIR POV  BOOK'S CAR

               The car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now 
               bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field. It's knocked 
               over a tall birdhouse by the roadside. The car finally comes 
               to rest against a bank of earth.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               She stares...

               running toward the car.

               EXT. STABLES  DAY

               Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He 
               hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot.

               ANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR

               We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible 
               in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under 
               his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. 
               Momentarily he comes awake:

                                     RACHEL
                         But John... why didn't you go to a

                              (bewildered)
                         But why?

                                     BOOK
                         Gunshot... they'll file reports... 
                         they'll find me.

                                     RACHEL
                         But 

               Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely:

                                     BOOK
                         And when they find me, they'll find 
                         your boy!

               He slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the 
               price he's paid in returning them to safety.

               She reaches out, touches him gently.

               But the moment is broken by...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses 
               to glance into the car.

                                     ELI
                         Is the English dead?

                         Looks dead...

               And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place 
               him in the back of the springwagon. And...

               INT. LAMP FARMHOUSE

               Where Eli is looking out a window.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car.

               ANGLE IN BEDROOM

               Where Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with 
               warm water from a pan.

               Eli appears in the doorway.

                                     ELI
                         Stoltzfus is coming.

               Rachel looks at him, nods.

               Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly 
               folded clothes on a chair near the bed.

                                     ELI
                         That has no place in this house.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know.

               She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places 
               them in a chest.

                                     RACHEL

               As Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage 
               son, LEVI.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.

               Stoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         That's the English is it?

               INT. SICKROOM  TIGHT

               As Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of 
               Book's wound:

                                     STOLTZFUS (O.S.)
                         I feel... burning.

               WIDER

               As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, 
               moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the 
               examination.

               Finally he steps back.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         This man should be treated in town.
                              (indicates)
                         The bullet entered there... and came 
                         out there. But there is the danger 
                         of infection, and he has lost a great 
                         deal of blood.

               Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her 
               dilemma.

               Her eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room:

                                     RACHEL
                         Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.

               She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and 
               Stoltzfus:

                                     RACHEL
                         No, he must stay here.

               Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And:

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if 
                         he dies? Then the sheriff will come. 
                         They'll say we broke their laws 

                                     RACHEL
                         We'll pray that he doesn't die! But 
                         if he does, then we'll find a way so 
                         no one knows!

                                     ELI
                         Rachel, this is a man's life, we 
                         hold it in our hands.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know God help me, I know that, 
                         Eli.
                              (then)
                         But I tell you that if he's found 
                         here, the people who did this to him 
                         will come for Samuel.

               Rachel beseeches them helplessly:

                                     RACHEL
                         What else can we do?

               EXT. LAPP DRIVE

               Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and 
               is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel 
               catching a ride on the bumper.

               Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As 
               the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors.

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

               As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to 
               Rachel:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Make a poultice... three parts milk, 
                         two parts linseed oil... for the 
                         infection.

               I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you.

               Stoltzfus turns to Eli:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp, I'll have to speak with the 
                         diener on this matter.

                                     ELI
                              (nods)
                         As you see fit, Stoltzfus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SICKROOM  LAPS FARM  NIGHT

               As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning 
               low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.

               Book's brow is beaded with sweat.

               Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat-
               soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should 
               get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on 
               display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.

               She begins to apply the poultice.

               ANGLE

               As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he 
               recoils with alarm.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's all right! You have got to lie 
                         still.

               Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what 
               she says seems to penetrate. He quiets.

                                     RACHEL
                              (soothingly)
                         Yes, much better...

               ANGLE

               As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her 
               hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so.

               She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, 
               so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, 
               scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one 
               shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious 
               Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at 
               first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck 
               this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks 
               coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. 
               She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind 
               her.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  DAY

               He's on the phone:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Looks like we're going to need some 
                         help from you folks down there.

               INT. LANCASTER COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE  DAY

               Where an UNDERSHERIFF is on the phone:

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         ...want to help any way we can, Chief, 
                         but you got to understand we've got 
                         upwards of seven thousand Amish over 
                         here.

               And that's just Lancaster County.

               INTERCUT SCHAEFFER

               Who is trying to control his impatience:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. 
                         Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should 
                         simplify your work.

               The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down 
               to.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         How about an address?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Ah... no.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                              (frowns)
                         Maybe a road or route number?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Sorry.

               The Undersheriff is not impressed.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third 
                         Amishman around here is named Lapp. 
                         That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
                              (and)
                         Chief, if the Amish have taken your 
                         man in, I wouldn't want to hang from 
                         a rope until you find him.

               ANGLE

               Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an 
                         education.

               He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then 
               he glances up.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who 
               spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  DAY

               A bright, sunny afternoon.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn. In the b.g. 
               three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty. 
               Visitors.

               ANGLE IN SICKROOM

               Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided. 
               He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room.

               BOOK'S POV  CLERGY

               PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around 
               the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in 
               German.

               These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, 
               sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; 
               and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat 
               apart.

               ANGLE

               Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes.

               Tschantz rumbles in German.

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to 
                         your credit.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         He was touched by God's hand.

               Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with 
               him.

               Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup, 
               smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Hello.

               Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen.

                                     BOOK
                              (closing his eyes)
                         Who are they?

                                     RACHEL
                         The leadership of our district... 
                         the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the 
                         one with no hair on top. They decided 
                         to come and see you for themselves. 
                         Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came 
                         the first day. I think he saved your 
                         life.

                                     BOOK
                         Can I have something to drink?

               Rachel brings him tea.

                                     BOOK
                         Does anybody know I'm here?

                                     RACHEL
                         Only the elders.

                                     BOOK
                         How long?

                                     RACHEL
                         What?

                                     BOOK
                         How long have I been here?

                                     RACHEL
                         Two days.

                                     BOOK
                              (a beat)
                         Listen, thank you. Thanks for 
                         everything. But I've got to go.

                                     RACHEL
                              (frowns)
                         But you can't.

               He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the 
               sheet.

                                     RACHEL
                         See. Anyway, you don't have any 
                         clothes on. And besides that, Bishop 
                         Tschantz wants to talk to you when 
                         you feel better.

               The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and 
               are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket. 
                         And drink my of my tea.

               He goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel 
               puts the teacup to his lips.

                                     BOOK
                         Tell him his tea stinks.

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         You tell him. When you're able.

               He looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises.

                                     RACHEL
                              (from the door)
                         We're all very happy that you're 
                         going to live, John Book. We didn't 
                         quite know what we were going to do 
                         with you if you died.

               That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into 
               sleep again.

               INT. LAPP LIVING ROOM  DAY

               As the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         ...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         It is not the first time we have 
                         done this. In the Englischer war of 
                         the revolution, old Elmer Miller's 
                         grandfather took in gunshot English 
                         soldiers.
                              (a tad of pride)
                         Saved them, too.

               They all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then:

                                     ERB
                         Still, he should be among his own 
                         people.

               Rachel enters on this last.

                                     RACHEL
                         He'll leave as soon as he is able. 
                         He already wants to go.

               Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         How long will that be, Stoltzfus?

                                     STOLTZFUS
                              (shrugs)
                         A month. Maybe less. With God's 
                         healing love.

               EXT. BOOK'S SISTER'S HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Schaeffer is knocking at the front doors. A beat, then Elaine 
               opens it cautiously, peers out.

                                     ELAINE
                              (half fearfully)
                         Did you find him?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Not yet.

               Suddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door:

                                     ELAINE
                         Then go away, you bastard.

               Schaeffer quickly  but gently  prevents her from shutting 
               it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I've come to apologize for 
                         Lt. McElroy. He overstated the 
                         department's position.

                                     ELAINE
                              (bitterly)
                         He accused John of taking kickbacks. 
                         And you know  anybody who knows 
                         John  knows that's a goddamn lie!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (smoothly)
                         Of course, Elaine. But as long as 
                         there's any question, better Johnny 
                         should come back and clear his name.

                         Better you should get off my front 
                         porch before I get my mace!

                         Elaine, I don't want to have to take 
                         you in for questioning. You've got 
                         his car, you were the last to see 
                         him 

                                     ELAINE
                              (clipped)
                         I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         But... if you had to guess?

               McElroy watching.

               THEIR POV  FRONT DOOR

               We see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer. Elaine 
               forces the door shut. Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his 
               car.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S CAR

               As Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into 
               the seat, beside McElroy.

                                     MCELROY
                         She say where he is?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I don't think she knows.

               Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What about Carter?

                                     MCELROY
                         Tight. But I'm working on him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lean on him.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               REESTABLISHING, and TIGHTENING to the upstairs sickroom window 
               where a lamp dimly burns.

               INT. SICKROOM

               As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep 
               on the bed.

               Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is 
               indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed 
               and opens the clothes chest.

               ANGLE

               Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded 
               clothes.

               Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled 
               pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon 
               from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...

               BOOK

               His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the 
               boy something of a jolt.

                         Give me that.

               Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He 
               looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots 
               the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes 
               out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He 
               snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.

               The boy edges closer.

                         You ever handle a pistol like this,

                                     SAMUEL
                              (swallows)
                         No pistol. Ever.

                         handle this one. But only if you 
                         promise not to say anything to your 
                         momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (grins)
                         Okay, Mr. Book.

               Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne-
               tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, 
               demonstrating the action.

               He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.

                         Call me John.

               The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but 
               his hands are too small. Book smiles.

               Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two 
               hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so 
               that it's not pointed at him.

                                     BOOK
                         You don't want to point that at people 
                         you just started calling by their 
                         first name.

               Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps 
               the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to 
               find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and 
               Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead.

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         Samuel!

               Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters 
               it:

                                     RACHEL
                         Wait for me downstairs.

               Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, I would appreciate it if, 
                         during the time you are with us, you 
                         would have as little to do with Samuel 
                         as possible.

                                     BOOK
                         Nobody meant any harm. The boy was 
                         curious. I unloaded the gun -

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not the gun. Don't you 
                         understand... It's you. What you 
                         stand for.
                              (and)
                         That is not for Samuel.

               Book looks at her thoughtfully.

               Rachel softens a bit:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, it has nothing to do with 
                         you personally.

               He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets.

                                     BOOK
                         Put it up someplace Samuel can't get 
                         it.

               A beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go. Book 
               stops her:

                                     BOOK
                         Friends?

               Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN  LAPP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. Eli sits 
               on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other. Rachel looks 
               on from the b.g.

               Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will 
               ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central 
               pillars of the Amish way.

                                     ELI
                         The gun  that gun of the hand  is 
                         for the taking of human life. Would 
                         you kill another man? Eh?

               Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli 
               leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.

                                     ELI
                         What you take into your hands, you 
                         take into your heart.

               A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I would only kill a bad man.

                                     ELI
                         Only a bad man. I see. And you know 
                         these bad men on sight? You are able 
                         to look into their hearts and see 
                         this badness?

                                     SAMUEL
                         I can see what they do.

               Now he meets Eli's eyes:

                                     SAMUEL
                         I have seen it.

               Eli expels a deep sigh; then:

                                     ELI
                         And having seen, you would become 
                         one of them?
                              (intent... gesturing)
                         Don't you see...? The hand leads the 
                         arm leads the shoulder leads the 
                         head... leads the heart. The one 
                         goes into the other into the other 
                         into the other... And you have 
                         changed, and gone amongst them...

               He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the 
               boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly 
               into the tabletop with enormous intensity:

                                     ELI
                         "Wherefore come out from among them 
                         and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"

                                     ELI
                              (indicating pistol; 
                              continuing from 
                              Corinthians 6:17)
                         "And touch not the unclean thing!"

               His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely 
               impressive.

               EXT. WASHHOUSE  NEAR KITCHEN  NIGHT 

               Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most 
               or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way 
               into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come 
               out from the kitchen.

               EXT. BARN  LAPP FARM  DAY

               Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the 
               traces of the buggy.

               INT. BOOK'S BEDROOM  DAY

               Book stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the 
               window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat, 
               then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, 
               picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's 
               a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The 
               Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table.

               There's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing. 
               She smiles.

                                     RACHEL

                         the use of them. Besides, in your 
                         clothes you'd stand out to strangers.

                         No. I'd want a public phone.

               Rachel's face clouds.

                                     RACHEL
                         Well... the store at Saltzburg...
                              (then briskly)
                         But you won't be going to Saltzburg 
                         for a while.

                              (cutting in)
                         I know what he said.

                                     RACHEL
                         You can go with Eli. He's taking 
                         Samuel to school. But you'll have to 
                         hurry.

               Rachel turns to leave when Book calls her back.

                                     BOOK
                         Rachel.

               She turns to look at him. It's the first time he's used her 
               name.

                                     BOOK
                         Thanks.

               She smiles and leaves.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Eli calls impatiently from the buggy. Samuel sits beside 
               him.

                                     ELI
                         Hurry up now, John Book!

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter. She laughs 
               out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly 
               so  the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket 
               ill-fitting.

               Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish.

               Outside another SHOUT from Eli.

                                     RACHEL
                         You'd better go.

               Book looks embarrassed.

                                     BOOK
                         My... eh... gun?

               The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a 
               cupboard. She passes the gun in its holster to Book. He 
               fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" 
               increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back 
               to her and checks the weapon. He turns back to her smiling 
               in an odd way.

                                     BOOK
                         The... bullets?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh. The bullets.

               She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to 
               Book.

                                     BOOK
                              (attempting a joke)
                         Not much good without them.

               INT. BUGGY  COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

               Samuel sits between Eli and Book. Both men stare straight 
               ahead.

               Eli looks particularly stern. It's pretty clear he doesn't 
               like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith.

               EXT. AMISH ONE-TEACHER-SCHOOL  DAY

               With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his 
               friends. A teacher begins ringing a bell.

               INT. STORE  SALTZBURG

               Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered. 
               He looks about him  several Amish and Dithers mingle in the 
               shop.

               Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self-
               conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously... A voice 
               comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah?

               A silence.

                                     BOOK
                         It's me.

                         care of business. How hot am I?

                                     CARTER
                              (low, urgent)
                         Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm coming.

                                     CARTER
                         Listen, Johnny, don't do anything 
                         stupid. You couldn't get within a 
                         mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay 
                         put... Stay in touch  I'll let you 
                         know when maybe it makes sense.

               A beat as Book considers that.

                                     CARTER
                              (edgily)
                         You hear me?

                                     BOOK
                              (finally)
                         I hear you. I'll stay in touch.

                                     CARTER
                         That's more like it.
                              (and)
                         Where are you at, anyway?

               Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image 
               reflected in the window of the store.

                                     BOOK
                         Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

                                     CARTER
                              (uncomprehending)
                         Say again?

                                     BOOK
                         Make that 1790.

               He hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the 
               store.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's 
               trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted 
               under the front seat of the Lapp buggy.

               Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the 
               disapproving look.

                                     ELI
                         If you are well enough to do that 
                         thing, you can do work for me.

               Book is genuinely apologetic.

                                     BOOK
                         Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind 
                         me plugging in to your battery. Mine's 
                         dead... How can I help? What can I 
                         do?

                                     ELI
                         Maybe milking.

                              (eyes Eli)

                         Cows. You know, cows?

                                     BOOK
                         I've seen pictures.

                         Good, you start tomorrow.

               INT. BOOK'S ROOM  LAPP FARM  NIGHT

               Where Book lies asleep. A beat, then Eli comes in carrying a 
               lamp.

               He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with 
               undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump:

                                     ELI
                              (briskly)
                         Veck oufl. Time for milking.

               Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his 
               watch.

               INSERT WATCHFACE

               It reads 4:30 a.m.

               BACK TO BOOK

               As he stares at it in disbelief.

               INT. BARN

               As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with 
               Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls. 
               Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs.

               BOOK, ELI

               Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand. 
               We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from 
               scalding milk cans rising behind her).

                                     ELI
                         Good, firm twist and pull, eh?
                              (and)
                         Right. Now you try it.

               Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow 
               shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book 
               bends to his task.

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You 
                         never had your hands on a teat before?

                                     BOOK
                              (grimly)
                         Not one this big.

               Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a 
               comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars 
               him.

               Then he moves off. Book bends to his task, and...

               ANGLE  RACHEL

               Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand.

               As he pours a pail full of milk into a large, stainless steel 
               milk can.

               EXT. BARN

               As the milk herd is released back into the pasture. Book

               And dawnfire etching the hilltops. The BELLHOUSE behind the 
               house, the sun reflecting from the heavy bell beneath its 
               small roof.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty.

               A beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together 
               against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  DAY

               It is later in the morning. Rachel comes out onto the porch, 
               tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks 
               toward the barn.

               ANGLE  THE BARN

               Eli and Book standing in one of the open doorways, looking 
               in.

               INT. THE BARN

               ANGLE FAVORING Luke, one of Eli's team of fine mules as Samuel 
               opens the stall gate. The beast is skittish, obviously 
               afflicted with something of a behavioral problem.

               But he allows Samuel to lead him out.

               BOOK, ELI

               As Samuel brings Luke out. Eli is now harnessing the other 
               mule of the team to a large manure-spreader. But as Luke 
               nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel 
               off his feet.

                                     BOOK
                              (alarmed)
                         Careful, son 

               Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious 
               mistake. Luke erupts into a SCREAMING, bucking cyclone. Samuel 
                who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover 
               as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off.

               Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he 
               BELLOWS belligerently in German at the rearing animal. Finally 
               he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to 
               have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.

               ANGLE

               Samuel gives the shaken Book a look:

                                     SAMUEL
                         That's Luke. He doesn't like 
                         strangers.

                                     BOOK
                              (still shaken)
                         You don't say.

               Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at 
               Book.

                                     ELI
                         Have to teach you mules, too, I guess.

               EXT. FIELD NEAR FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car 
               knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses 
               as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, 
               Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing 
               smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes 
               people.

                                     HOCHSTETLER

                         name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.

                         You look plain, Book.
                              (grinning)
                         Very plain.

               Book is not particularly amused.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I came to see Rachel Lapp.

                                     BOOK
                         Try the house.

               Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (genially)
                         You bet. you take care of yourself.

               Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with 
               some interest.

               ANGLE

               As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also 
               catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion 
               crossing her expression for an instant.

               And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.

               Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.

               HOG PENS

               Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is 
               headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He 
               glances toward the house:

               HIS POV  THE BACK PORCH

               Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing, 
               sharing a pitcher of lemonade.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Thoughtful... He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow SQUEALS 
               and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she 
               can feed.

                                     BOOK
                         Pigs.

               INT. CARPENTRY SHOP, LAPP FARM  DAY

               Book works on repairing the broken birdhouse when Rachel 
               enters.

               BOOK

               He uses a drawknife on a piece of 2x4, with some obvious 
               expertise.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the 
                         district. He and his father built 
                         the big house themselves forty years 
                         ago.

                                     BOOK
                         Oh?
                              (and)
                         What happened to Hochstetler?

                                     RACHEL
                         We had some lemonade and he left.

                                     BOOK
                         A real fireball.

               Rachel smiles. Book crosses to a workbench and selects another 
               tool.

                                     RACHEL
                         You know carpentry?

                                     BOOK
                         I did some carpentry summers when I 
                         was going to school.

                                     RACHEL
                         What else can you do?

                                     BOOK
                              (really annoyed)
                         I can whack people. I'm hell at 
                         whacking.

                                     RACHEL
                         Whacking is not of much use on a 
                         farm.

                                     BOOK
                         Now hold on. There's a lot of people 
                         who think being a cop is a legitimate 
                         job.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.

               She turns, starts to go. Then turns back, eyeing his makeshift 
               garb:

                                     RACHEL
                         Tonight I'll let out those trousers 
                         for you.

               Stifling a smile, she goes. HOLD on Book a beat, then...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  DINING ROOM

               Eli is seated at the head of the table, Book opposite Samuel 
               and Rachel. The table is piled high with an incredible amount 
               of food.

               Eli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him:

                                     ELI
                         Eat up, Book. What's the matter with 
                         your appetite?

                                     BOOK
                         Guess I'm not used to so much.

                                     ELI
                              (snorts)
                         Not used to hard work. That's what 
                         makes an appetite.

               Book swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, John is a carpenter.
                              (conciliatory 
                              afterthought)
                         As well as being a fine policeman.

                                     ELI
                         Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to 
                         Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how 
                         good a carpenter.

               Book can't refuse the challenge.

                                     BOOK
                         Sure.

                                     RACHEL
                         But... You may not be well enough.

                                     BOOK
                         I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' 
                         tea.

               EXT. / INT. BARN  NIGHT

               As Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. She looks in 
               to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp 
               buggy.

               He glances up as she enters:

                                     BOOK
                         Hi...

               As she sets her lamp down near the one he's using.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat)
                         When will you be going?

                                     BOOK
                         Not long... A few days.

               Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the 
               battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the 
               Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major 
               inventions  rock and roll.

               It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more 
               even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's 
               his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous 
               as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in 
               Amish.

               Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book 
               sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel 
               alternately protesting and laughing.

                                     BOOK
                         You like it... Don't you?

               Rachel, confused, protests:

                                     RACHEL
                         No... You just stop 

               But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:

                                     BOOK
                              (mock alarm)
                         Next thing you know you'll be off 
                         drinking beer and racing motorcycles.

               And it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.

               ANGLE  THE BARN DOOR

               As Eli suddenly appears. He glowers for an instant, 
               thunderstruck, then BELLOWS:

                                     ELI
                         Rachel!

               THE SCENE

               As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both 
               turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without 
               discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, 
               turns off the radio, as:

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         What is this? This Myusick?

               Book hesitates, then starts to say something:

                                     BOOK
                         It's not her fault. I 

               But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         How can this be? How can you do such 
                         a thing? Is this plain? Is this the 
                         ordnung?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have done nothing against the 
                         ordnung.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this 
                         man to our house. With his gun of 
                         the hand. You bring fear to this 
                         house. Fear of English with guns 
                         coming after. You bring blood and 
                         whispers of more blood. Now English 
                         music... and you are dancing to 
                         English music! And you call this 
                         nothing?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have committed no sin.

                                     ELI
                              (in English)
                         No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, 
                         it does not look...
                              (tone softening... in 
                              the dialect)
                         Don't you know there has been talk? 
                         Talk about you, not him. Talk about 
                         going to the Bishop. About having 
                         you... shunned!

                                     RACHEL
                         That is idle talk.

                                     ELI
                              (in English, pleading)
                         Do not make light of it, Rachel. 
                         They can do it... quick! Like that! 
                         And then... then I can not sit at 
                         table with you. I can not take a 
                         thing from your hand. I... I can not 
                         go with you to meeting!
                              (the old man almost 
                              breaks down as, in 
                              the dialect)
                         Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go 
                         too far! Dear child!

               Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's 
               plea  but irked by his condescending tone.

                                     RACHEL
                         I am not a child.

                                     ELI
                              (suddenly stern again)
                         You are acting like one!

                                     RACHEL
                         I will be the judge of that.

                                     ELI
                              (fierce as a prophet)
                         No! They will be the judge of that! 
                         And so will I... if you shame me!

                                     RACHEL
                              (blinking a tear now, 
                              but meeting his gaze)
                         You shame yourself.

               And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  NIGHT

               Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences 
               grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled 
               question or statement.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know where he is.

                                     CARTER
                         Wrong.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You'd lie to protect him.

                                     CARTER
                              (cool)
                         Probably.

               Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You admit you're lying?

                                     CARTER
                              (shakes head)
                         I admit I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're the first one he'll contact.

                                     CARTER
                              (sighing)
                         He's got my number.

               Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep 
               breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable 
               of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even 
               CHUCKLES as he begins:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         It's funny. I know he's hiding 
                         somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
                              (a quick glance at 
                              Carter)
                         Can you imagine John Book at a prayer 
                         meeting? Our John Book?

               Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.

               Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt 
               shift in form... but still speaks softly.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Either you're a member of the club 
                         or you aren't, Elton.
                              (he nods his head, as)
                         Tell me what you know...

                                     CARTER
                         What I know, Paul, is...
                              (nodding his head)
                         He's going to take you out...

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading 
               provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.

               BACK TO BOOK  INT. / EXT. BARN

               As he goes into the barn.

               Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the 
               temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his 
               hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.

               Book starts to talk gently to the animal:

                                     BOOK
                         All right, you nasty son of a bitch, 
                         we're going to be friends whether 
                         you like it or not.

               Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall 
               gate.

               ANGLE

               As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, 
               brings out some lumps of sugar.

                                     BOOK
                         See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't 
                         you for Christ's sake?

               Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends 
               to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled 
               expression.

                                     RACHEL
                              (surprised)
                         Well...

               Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!

                                     BOOK
                         Won him over just like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see.
                              (and)
                         But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
                              (then, going)
                         Eli is ready to go to Zook's.

               Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a 
               nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him 
               skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:

                                     BOOK
                         Later.

               And we...

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are 
               arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.

               In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the 
               construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun 
               raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.

               Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are 
               spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot 
               coffee and cold lemonade for the men,

               LAPP BUGGY

               As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the 
               construction site.

                                     ELI
                         Wait here 'til I find a gang you can 
                         work with.

               He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and 
               more workmen and their families climb out.

               Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad 
               face breaks into a grin:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Book! Good to see you!

               He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting 
               and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.

               Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his 
               showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.

               And Book realizes it as well.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

                                     BOOK
                         It's been a while.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         No matter. Come with me. We can always 
                         use a good carpenter.

               With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and 
               ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:

                                     RACHEL
                         Good luck.

               BOOK / HOCHSTETLER

               As they move off.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Your hole is healed, then?

                                     BOOK
                              (gives him a look)
                         Pretty much.

               Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good. Then you can go home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CUTS

               As the morning progresses:

               ...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers 
               on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of 
               competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely 
               unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the 
               gang.

               ...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems  without leaning 
               on it too heavily  to be measuring the two men as the morning 
               progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of 
               them.

               ...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with 
               sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising 
               the construction. All around them the structure is rising 
               with remarkable rapidity.

               ...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge 
               noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., 
               knitting or doing quiltwork.

               ...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a 
               group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls 
               "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).

               ...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs 
               in the sunlight, looking on  the old men kibitzing in German, 
               the women gossiping.

               Until...

               BIG SHOT

               Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at 
               least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about 
               the barn framework...

               ...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, 
               others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and 
               what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing 
               up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in 
               sight.

               WOMEN'S AREA

               As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women 
               eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering. 
               Rachel ignores them.

               She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral 
               sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of 
               fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously 
               liking Rachel.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Everyone has an idea about you and 
                         the English.

                                     RACHEL
                         All of them charitable, I'm sure.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Hardly any of them.

               ANGLE  THE ROOFBEAM

               Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding 
               them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They 
               are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, 
               way out at the far end of the roof.

               Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start 
               to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.

               Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof 
               with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it 
               back together.

               Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.

               Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Nail it!

                                     BOOK
                         Yes, sir.

               And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, 
               looks on.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BIG SHOT

               The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. 
               It's late afternoon.

               ANGLE ON BOOK

               He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The 
               exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of 
               fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's 
               determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, 
               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler 
               guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm 
               about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From 
               below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.

               Hochstetler shouts:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         We admire our work!

               The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes 
               his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his 
               appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no 
               thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding 
               SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  EVENING

               The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer 
               up a blessing on the new barn.

               CONGREGATION

               PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words 
               rolling out over the still evening air.

               Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers 
               he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels 
               something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too 
               closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing 
               prayer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  NIGHT

               Book stands outside, listening to the NIGHT SOUNDS. He turns, 
               walks up toward the porch.

               EXT. PORCH  TARP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night 
               sky.

               There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes 
               toward the door.

               ANGLE  THE DOOR

               Samuel standing there in his nightshirt.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Book leans forward in his chair.

                                     BOOK
                         Hey, Sam...

                                     SAMUEL
                         ...I want to say a thing.

                                     BOOK
                              (sitting up)
                         What's that, Sam?

               The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts 
               across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... 
               then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving 
               the door open behind him.

               ANGLE  BOOK

               Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he 
               speaks softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Same to you, Sam.

               After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door 
               that Samuel has left open behind him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to 
               the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see 
               where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. 
               The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks 
               softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Sam?

               No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind 
               him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen.

               INT. LAPP WASHHOUSE  NIGHT

               Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is 
               pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.

               She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of 
               her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back 
               of a chair.

               Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.

               RACHEL'S POV  FRYING PAN

               The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over 
               the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image 
               reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel hesitates for a moment  and in that moment she makes 
               a choice.

               Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his 
               eyes.

               And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of 
               eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, 
               for an instant, a woman of Book's world.

               BOOK

               As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable 
               to make it happen.

               And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, 
               picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting 
               it on, looks away.

               BOOK

               TIGHTENING to him, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE  HEN YARD

               Where Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens.

               A beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as 
               she senses his presence.

               Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing 
               them in the fold of her apron.

               When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.

               She goes very still, but keeps her back to him.

                         leave.

               She lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from 
               him.

               Book continues to stare at her.

               EXT. RURAL ROAD  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               The Lapp carriage on a winding lane.

               INT. BUGGY (MOVING)

               Rachel is driving, Book sitting next to her. Samuel is in 
               the back, looking out the rear window and not paying any 
               attention to the adults.

               A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all 
               Book can do to keep from flinching.

               Rachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe I ought to learn to drive this 
                         thing.

               Rachel says nothing.

                                     BOOK

                         Pick myself up another useful skill.

               Now Rachel can't help but smile. She looks at him. And...

               EXT. ANGLE

               We can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection, 
               another buggy approaching at right angles.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield.

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel, who is that?

               Samuel checks out the buggy.

                                     SAMUEL
                         It looks like Hochstetler's mare.

               EXT. ANGLE

               As the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler 
               buggy swings in behind them. Then the Hochstetler buggy, 
               coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel 
               returns her greeting:

                                     BOOK
                              (teasing her)
                         Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.

               Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick  
               the race is on.

               RACE MONTAGE

               Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together 
               with his young sister  at first they're not aware of the 
               race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and 
               gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and 
               neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.

               It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off 
               Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she 
               gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers 
               of Samuel and Book.

               EXT. SALZBURGSTORE  DAY

               It's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're 
               everywhere  taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY 
               YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence 
               fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.

               Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; 
               the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing 
               smoke pulls up nearby.

               Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's 
               stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She 
               waggles the camera at him...

                                     TOURIST LADY
                         Could I... ah, you know?

                                     BOOK
                              (smiling)
                         Lady, if you take my picture, I'll 
                         rip your brassiere off and strangle 
                         you with it.

               The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her 
               grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back 
               from whence she came.

               INT. STORE

               Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company 
               of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying 
               Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention 
               as the shopping.

               Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN 
               to him, and...

                         Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.

               A beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia 
               Police Department switchboard:

                                     VOICE

                                     VOICE
                         I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter 
                         was killed in the line of duty...

               Book hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of 
               the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain 
               control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to 
               move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a 
               second number.

               Schaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily 
               shocked.

               She calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation.

                         How are you, John?

               Paul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called 
               away from the Saturday afternoon game.

                                     MRS. SCHAEFFER

                         You can hang up, dear.

               We HEAR the click of the other phone,

               Book hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on 
               Schaeffer.

               Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second 
               to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist 
               his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... 
               Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the 
               situation.

               He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his 
               eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General 
               Store.

               Book, as Rachel eyes him. She has noticed his changed mood, 
               but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious 
               to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists 
               and traffic.

               EXT. NARROW SIDE STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               The buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards 
               ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road  
               several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped, 
               facing the buggy.

               As Rachel approaches the scene, slowing down and finally 
               stopping.

               Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks 
               at Book.

               Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Do nothing. This happens from time

               She senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly.

                         It's not our way, John. We'll have 
                         nothing to do with violence! John!

               Book shakes free, gets out and slowly walks toward the...

               EXT. HOCHSTETLER'S BUGGY  DAY

               Hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various 
               jeers and taunts from the English lads  various jokes about 
               them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into 
               Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle 
               on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing 
               it to shy. A third notices the slow, sure, approach of John 
               Book.

                                     YOUTH
                         Here comes another one!

               Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth 
               flicks off Book's hat.

                                     BOOK
                              (quietly)
                         You're making a mistake.

               Hochstetler calls from his buggy.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Everything is all right, John.

                                     BOOK
                              (to the youth)
                         Pick up the hat.

               The youth momentarily unsure  something about Book's tone 
               of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps 
               on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A 
               pause, then Book explodes.

               The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he 
               hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth 
               grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into 
               him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. 
               He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. 
               Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd 
               is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book 
               shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a 
               kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction 
               of the Lapp farm.

               The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back 
               to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD 
               LOCAL addresses Rachel.

                         John, lost control of himself. He... 
                         will be repentant.

                                     LOCAL MAN
                              (to Rachel)
                         You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes. Samuel! We're going.

               A second man calls from the pickup.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         Kid's nose is broken!

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         We'll take him up the hospital. Good-
                         day to you, Mrs. Lapp.
                              (he shouts after her)
                         This ain't good for the tourist trade, 
                         you know! You tell that to your Ohio 
                         cousin!

               But Rachel is already steering past the scene and following 
               the by now distant figure of John Book.

               EXT. BARN / CARPENTER'S SHOP  DUSK

               Book comes out of the carpenter's shop carrying the repaired 
               birdhouse on its pole in one hand, a shovel in the other.

               Rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn.

                                     RACHEL
                         You should not bother with that 
                         birdhouse.
                              (a beat)
                         If you're leaving tomorrow.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm leaving tonight.
                              (and)
                         I'm going to need my clothes. And my 
                         gun.

               She nods, looks away... looks back at him twice in glances. 
               There is a moment when it appears she might either bark at 
               him or begin to weep. He waits. When she does turn to him, 
               she speaks softly:

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I thought you 
                         might have stayed.

                                     BOOK
                              (hesitating... then)
                         There was.

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I would have 
                         welcomed it.

                                     BOOK
                              (after a beat)
                         I know.

                                     RACHEL
                              (asking)
                         I was being foolish?

                                     BOOK
                         No.
                              (and)
                         I was being unrealistic. Even thinking 
                         about living this life.

                                     RACHEL
                         You're so sure of that?

                                     BOOK
                         Aren't you? After today?

                              (almost conceding it, 
                              but... her voice 
                              rising a bit, annoyed)
                         I'm not so sure of anything as you 
                         are, John Book. You could live this 
                         life if you wanted to bad enough.
                              (a beat)

                              (almost groaning)
                         Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.

                                     RACHEL
                         There is always a way! But you are 
                         such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot 
                         see! You'd rather go back to that 
                         city! To nothing! No woman! No 
                         children! No land!

                                     BOOK
                              (now getting annoyed)
                         Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman 
                         and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's 
                         what I know and that's what I do!

                                     RACHEL
                         What you do is take vengeance! Which 
                         is a sin against heaven!

                                     BOOK
                         That's your way, not mine.

                                     RACHEL
                         That's God's way!

                                     BOOK
                         Well in the City of Philadelphia, 
                         God needs a little help!

               He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring 
               himself to make an instant apology. But he's chewing on it 
               when she takes the moment unto herself. She pulls herself 
               up, speaks with great dignity:

                                     RACHEL
                         I could never love a man who was 
                         so... little.

               He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, 
               realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even 
               get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but 
               then does not.

               She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him. 
               she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with 
               some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.

                                     RACHEL
                         The other night... when you saw me 
                         after my bath... I... I tried to 
                         look as I thought you would want a 
                         woman to look.
                              (sadly... but with a 
                              slight, proud lift 
                              of chin)
                         I am sorry... that I did not.

               She holds for an instant, then turns and walks off.

               BOOK

               Looking after her. A face full of loss.

               INT. KITCHEN  DUSK

               Eli is lighting the lamps. Samuel reads a book at the kitchen 
               table. Rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a 
               few dishes. She looks out the window.

               CLOSE on her face, a strange expression.

               INT. / EXT RACHEL'S POV  DUSK

               The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse.

               INT. KITCHEN

               CLOSE on Rachel's hands, lifting items slowly up and of the 
               water to the draining board, where she places them carefully 
               down. She shakes the water off her hands.

               CLOSE on her face, still staring fixedly out the window. She 
               speaks without turning around.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?

               The old man glances at her; this is not their routine.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY  DUSK

               In the rapidly fading light, Rachel walks slowly toward Book.

               CLOSE on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book.

               ANGLE on Book, CLOSE. He turns and watches Rachel's approach.

               BIG WIDE ANGLE

               The light now nearly gone, the NIGHT SOUNDS beginning, as 
               Rachel reaches Book and they embrace.

               EXT. FIELD BY ROAD  NIGHT

               Book and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still 
               warm earth and make love.

               ESTABLISHING an all-night cafe in the early hours of the 
               morning.

               TIGHTENING to the bleakly lighted windows.

               INT. CARE

               A booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster 
               County Undersheriff and his SHERIFF  an expansive politician 
               type  are seated.

               The Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly. The Sheriff has a 
               county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes, 
               pointing directions to Schaeffer:

                                     SHERIFF
                         There... White Oak Road a couple of 
                         miles before it ties into two-twenty-
                         two. Got it?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.

                                     SHERIFF
                         My man Holmes here put it together. 
                         Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the 
                         doctor at the hospital.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked 
                         on the phone.
                              (nods at Holmes)
                         Good work.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Sure you don't want us to post some 
                         backup units?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         If we need any help, we'll give you 
                         a shout. I'd like to slip in there 
                         quiet, then get out before we attract 
                         any attention.

               EXT. CAFE PORCH  DAY

               As Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car. Holmes 
               and the Sheriff watch after them.

                                     HOLMES
                         Maybe I'll take a drive over that 
                         way.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry.

               But Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out.

               EXT. RURAL LANE  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAWN

               With the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon, 
               Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the 
               Lapp driveway and comes to a halt.

               In the b.g. we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings.

               HOLD as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car. 
               They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start TOWARD 
               CAMERA, spreading out as they turn up the long driveway... 
               figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn.

               ANGLE

               GOING WITH the trio of gunmen... McElroy, breath smoking in 
               the chill, eyes the terrain:

                                     MCELROY
                         Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. 
                         What do you figure they plug all 
                         their shit into?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         They don't have any shit.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out... 
               the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table. 
               Rachel is beginning the dishes.

               INT. BARN  DAWN

               Book and Samuel are starting the morning milking...

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the 
               kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons 
               leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer 
               enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Fergie)
                         Outside 
                              (to Mac)
                         Check out the rest of the house.

               He turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room.

               Schaeffer flashes his badge:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         We're police officers. We're looking 
                         for a fugitive, John Book. He's living 
                         here?

                                     ELI
                         I have nothing to say to you. Get 
                         out of my house!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You speak English. Good. Now listen 
                         

                              (recovering)
                         No, you listen. Get out!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lady, I'm here to help you. This man 
                         is very dangerous. An armed criminal.
                              (ingratiating)
                         He's got a gun, hasn't he?

                                     RACHEL
                         You have no right here!

               McElroy re-enters.

                                     MCELROY
                         He's not in this building.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Eli)
                         All right, where is he?

               Suddenly Eli SHOUTS: It's deafening. Probably the loudest 
               noise Eli has ever made:

                                     ELI
                         John Book!

               McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the 
               butt of his shotgun. Eli crumples to the floor. Rachel 
               SCREAMS, runs to Eli.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book and Samuel in the milkhouse. They've heard Eli's outcry. 
               Book moves to the window, looks out.

               BOOK'S POV  FERGIE

               About halfway between the barn and the house. He turns from 
               glancing back toward the house (having heard Eli's shout) 
               and starts again toward the barn. Gun at the ready.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Rachel kneeling next to Eli, wiping at his bruise with a 
               damp cloth. Schaeffer looks on.

                         You might have killed him!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to McElroy)
                         Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll 
                         watch these two.

               McElroy nods, moves outside, turns toward the barns.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book still at the window, Samuel now beside him, trying to 
               get a look.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is it them?

                         It's them, Sam.
                              (he bends to the boy, 
                              takes him by the 
                              shoulders)
                         Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to 
                         me carefully. Listen to me as you 
                         never listened before.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Are they going to kill you?

                                     BOOK
                         Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go 
                         across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. 
                         Run as fast as you can. And stay 
                         there!

                                     SAMUEL
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BOOK

                         say.

               He takes Samuel by the hand, leads him to the side door. He 
               bends, holds the boy close.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Don't let them hurt you.

                         Fast as you can!

               Sam turns, takes off.

               Samuel running.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie almost to the upper barn, McElroy  well back and 
               moving slowly, circumspectly  headed toward the lower barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy 
               heading for the milkhouse door. He can't see Fergie. He turns, 
               crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to 
               the upper barn.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, 
               gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.

               INT. BARN  ANGLE PAST BOOK

               Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie 
               easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind 
               the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside 
               Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm 
               him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's 
               nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes 
               widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.

               DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens 
               the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. 
               Fergie backs off, moves on.

               BOOK

               As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh 
               straw.

               Book eases back alongside Luke, waits.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch.

               BOOK  FLASH CUT

               As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack 
               on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy 
               explode in an horrendous SCREAM.

               FERGIE

               Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies 
               open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under 
               the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering 
               backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the 
               mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into 
               Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half 
               like a matchstick.

               BOOK

               As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the 
               barn.

               FERGIE

               Fallen, skull smashed... and now the dying Luke's legs buckle 
               and he collapses atop Fergie.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound 
               of the shots. Then starting slowly forward.

               On the porch of the house, looking toward the barn.

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               Some distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots, 
               stops dead in his tracks... the sound of the shots still 
               REVERBERATING across the quiet fields.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stricken)
                         Mr. Book?

               He hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the 
               barns.

               EXT. / INT. KITCHEN PORCH  DAY

               Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously 
               toward the barns. Starts out. Schaeffer pushes her back.

               As McElroy, checking the safety on his twelve-gauge, steps 
               into the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy flattens himself against the wall, looks around 
               fearfully.

                                     MCELROY
                              (softly)
                         Fergie?

               Only silence.

               Schaeffer staring toward the barn, SHOUTS:

                         What the hell happened?

               He listens, hears nothing, snorts, starts toward the barn 
               checking his gun, not hurrying.

               Samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small 
               muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls, 
               stops short, stares off screen.

               HIS POV  FERGIE

               Where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule, 
               his head crushed like an eggshell.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               As he moves on around Fergie and the dead mule, planting 
               each foot as if he were walking in a mine field.

               BOOK

               Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay 
               mow.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Moving toward the center of the barn.

               BOOK

               As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a 
               rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks 
               up.

               HIS POV  THE ROPE

               It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to 
               the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track 
               that runs the length of the roofbeam. Attached to this trolley 
               is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), U-shaped, sharply-
               pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the 
               floor. The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended 
               in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Keeping one eye on McElroy, he carefully begins to un-tie 
               the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the 
               suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either 
               spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His 
               shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS:

                                     MCELROY
                         Book, you sneaky bastard, I know 
                         you're here! Come out and fight!

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the SOUND OF 
               THE SHOT, wide-eyed. He listens for an-instant, starts a 
               step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large 
               bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. He 
               moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. The bell 
               CLANGS loudly, Sonorously.

               SCHAEFFER

               On the front porch, looking around for the location of the 
               sounding bell. He takes a step toward the barn, the stops, 
               looks back toward the house... frustrated.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book watches as McElroy starts to move again looking back 
               toward the SOUNDING of the bell.

               HIGH ANGLE  HAY FORK

               Looking down we can see McElroy almost directly beneath the 
               hay fork. The bell SOUNDING throughout. BOOK Waiting... trip 
               rope in hand. Then:

                                     BOOK
                              (shouting)
                         Hey, Mac!

               And he lets go the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               As he turns toward the SOUND of Book's voice.

               HAY FORK

               As it plummets down, causing a RATCHETING SOUND that fills 
               the barn, even drowns out the SOUND of the bell.

               MCELROY

               Eyes darting wildly, looking up.

               HIS POV  HAY FORK

               Plunging straight for him.

               MCELROY

               Diving to one side.

               ANGLE  HAY FORK

               THUDDING into the barn floor like a great trident fork.

               Quivering there, not a foot from McElroy's head.

               MCELROY

               Staring at the fork pop-eyed.

               BOOK

               Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in 
               the barn floor just in front of his parked car.

               MCELROY

               Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming, FIRING. 
               The shot smashes the windshield of the car.

               BOOK

               Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing 
               down out of sight.

               MCELROY

               FIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he 
               begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder. 
               The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY 
               POPS UP.

               ANGLE

               As McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, FIRES 
               twice.

               MCELROY'S POV  LAPP BUGGY

               The buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is 
               Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of 
               the rockerarm.

               He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of 
               his head, his face set against the tears that move down his 
               cheeks.

               SCHAEFFER

               Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward 
               the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward 
               the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. 
               He still can't see Samuel.

               HIS POV  THE PORCH

               As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, SHOUTING:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You stay put!

               RACHEL

               She stops. She is also unable to see Samuel.

               SCHAEFFER

               Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there 
               is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him.

               EXT. FIELDS  DAY

               Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, 
               Stotlzfus and others  including Hochstetler and his brothers 
                are baling the first cutting of June hay.

               But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in 
               toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the 
               Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.

               But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward 
               Samuel.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Cut that out!

               Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.

               Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of 
               the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs 
               on grimly.

               Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves 
               him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun 
               blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several 
               threads, so he FIRES again.

               The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to 
               look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when 
               Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy 
               kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness 
               right then and there.

               But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He 
               SNARLS at Sam:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get down to the house and stay there!

               Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.

               RACHEL

               Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in 
               her arms... then to lead him back toward the house.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. Then easing 
               over, placing his feet on the rungs.

               BOOK

               He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The 
               cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks 
               at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops 
               at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering 
               the rungs.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He turns now to a door at the back of the pen. He un-hooks 
               it, pulls it open, moves inside.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to 
               a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) 
               rises to the top of the structure.

               Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that 
               Book's been here before, expects what he sees.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond 
               it into the silo. There is about two feet of old silage 
               covering the floor. He turns, looks up the white walls.

               HIS POV  INSIDE SILO

               An inside ladder runs to the top.

               HIS POV  KICKBOARD

               Standing against the wall next to the entrance... . obviously 
               to be inserted as the silo is filled.

               BOOK

               Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses 
               to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other 
               direction (toward the milkhouse).

               BACK TO BOOK

               Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward 
               into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book 
               immediately turns, darts back into the silo.

               MCELROY

               Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his 
               eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow 
               half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. 
               McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table.

                                     ELI
                         Praise Gott!

               Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and 
               hard.

               She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big 
               family Bible. He crosses to the table, sets the book down, 
               places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him.

               Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man 
               helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, 
               takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of 
               the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out 
               how to open the chamber to load it.

               In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he 
               rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.

                                     ELI
                              (fiercely)
                         No, Rachel...

                                     RACHEL
                         I have to help him!

               Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try 
               to load the bullets. Eli's callused hand closes over hers, 
               halting the action:

                                     ELI
                         It is not our way!

               Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling 
               fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.

               A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers 
               release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes 
               her eyes.

               Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli 
               and Rachel silently.

               Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible 
               beneath his. They stand there and they pray.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance.

               MCELROY

               Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the 
               cowflops.

               The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly. 
               McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door. 
               As he arrives, he HEARS a noise  very slight  from the 
               direction of the silo.

               He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, 
               He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base 
               of the inner ladder, looks up.

               HIS POV  THE HATCH

               The patch of blue sky, forty feet up.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               He frowns, reaches out, grabs a rung.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, MUTTERS, CURSES 
               under his breath. Then he rounds the corner of the first 
               stall... and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of 
               him. Schaeffer stares, blinks... moves on spotting a spent 
               shotgun shell near the hayfork...

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book listening at the kickboard. SOUNDS of feet, shotgun 
               rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on 
               his side, starts silently up.

               MCELROY

               Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand.

               BOOK

               He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the 
               distance to the floor, starts upward again.

               BARN YARD  DAY

               The Amish beginning to arrive. Sam comes running, pulls 
               Stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other Amish 
               look at the shot-shattered bellrope. Rachel and Eli come 
               rapidly up the path toward the group.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the 
               ladder, looks down. He sets his shotgun down, takes out his 
               service revolver, starts down.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from 
               the ground. He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold 
               it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one 
               side as best he can... hangs there, listening.

               MCELROY

               Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard.

               BOOK

               Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side 
               of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, 
               raps on the board smartly once.

               MCELROY

               Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the 
               back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts 
               the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.

               BOOK

               We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, 
               with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it 
               to the floor.

               McELROY  FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling 
               forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book 
               seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and 
               GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy 
               manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet 
               to the bottom of the silo.

               BOOK

               He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies 
               stunned.

               MCELROY

               His forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head 
               bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he 
               falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as...

               TIGHT ON BOOK

               Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, 
               into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle 
               is placed firmly against Book's temple.

               WIDER

               Schaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as 
               if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a 
               SOUND behind him. He snaps around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening 
               (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the 
               shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on 
               as:

               SCHAEFFER

               He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Okay, Johnny. On your feet.

               THE SCENE

               As Book struggles to his feet  Schaeffer holding the pistol 
               tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, 
               blinks.

               Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward 
               Samuel, he speaks quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's okay, Sam.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway 
               toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in 
               at the inert McElroy) follow and...

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge 
               into the barnyard. Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol 
               pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw.

               Schaeffer pulls up, frowning:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Hold it.

               WHAT HE SEES

               The Amishmen gathered  the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler 
               brothers, et al. All staring hard at Schaeffer and Book.

               EXT. BARN / DRIVE  DAY

               From a high wide angle the final scene is played out. 
               Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive, 
               the Amish following along closely on both sides.

               CLOSE ON BOOK

               As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get back, you people!
                              (prodding)
                         Keep moving, Johnny...

               Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. 
               The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book 
               now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.

                                     BOOK
                         You're going to have to do it right 
                         here, Schaeffer.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Don't try me, Johnny!

               Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.

                                     ELI
                         So... will you kill us all, then?

               ANGLE

               As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly 
               turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled  
               and almost pressing against  Book's chest. Book locks eyes 
               with Schaeffer.

               Quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's all over, Paul.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Move! Or you die right here!

               Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand 
               wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun 
               falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force 
               of Book's grip.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes 
               him away. Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who  partly 
               to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to 
               congratulate him on his surrender  wraps one brawny arm 
               around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving 
               nod... holds Schaeffer as:

               BOOK

               Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes 
               meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read 
               resignation... whatever there was between them has been 
               terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               HIGH SHOT holding the moment.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LATE AFTERNOON

               The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange 
               in his working suit. He looks about him, sees Samuel down by 
               the pond.

               EXT. POND

               He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Are you really ever coming back?

                                     BOOK
                         Got to, Sam. You and I are going to 
                         a courthouse together, put some people 
                         behind bars.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Have you got your gun on now?

                                     BOOK
                         Sure have, Sam.

               Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.

               EXT. HOUSE  DAY

               He wants to kiss her, but does not. Their eyes say it all. 
               Eli has a final word, SHOUTING from the porch.

THE WONDER BOYS

 
                            WONDER BOYS

                BASED ON THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL CHABON

                       Screenplay/Steve Kloves

	January 21, 1999 (Pink Revision) 
	January 15, 1999 (Blue Revision) 
	December 18,1998


	All IS A BLUR. . .

	...then WORDS appear, twisting and vaguely transparent, 
	reflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he 
	reads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES.

					GRADY
		'The young girl sat perfectly still in the 
		confessional...

1	INT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON

	Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is 
	in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college 
	STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.

					GRADY
		...listening to her father's boots scrape like 
		chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then 
		grow faint, then disappear altogether.'

	As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, 
	perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE 
	BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:

	WELCOME TO WORDFEST

	GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if 
	they've been on a field trip to the DMV.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(a wave of the pages) 
		So. .Anyone?

	A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN 
	sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES 
	LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the 
	window.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
		Let me get this straight. The girl with the 
		big lips is depressed because, each night, when 
		her father goes off to work at the bakery, her 
		mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the 
		house. Not only does this girl have to listen 
		to her mother working this guy in the next 
		room, she has to wash the sheets each morning 
		before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of 
		this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy 
		takes her to confession--only, once she gets in 
		the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and 
		realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is 
		that it?

	James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY 
	OVERCOAT he wears.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?

					GRADY
		All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, 
		shall we? Howard, what about you?

					HOWARD 
		I hated it.

					GRADY
		That's not exactly what I meant by 
		constructive, Howard.

					HOWARD 
		I think James should try to be more 
		constructive. This is my second semester with 
		him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me 
		want to kill myself.

	GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. 
	Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the 
	raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. 

					GRADY
		Yes, Hannah?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I think maybe we're missing the point. It 
		seems to me James' strength as a writer is that 
		he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us 
		like adults. He respects us enough to forget 
		us. That takes . . . courage .

	GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.

					GRADY
		Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I 
		think. 
			(as the students rise) 
		Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And 
		remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to 
		tonight's cocktail party need to have them at 
		the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.

	Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.

					GRADY
		Thanks for that. He all right?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I think so. ..What about you?

					GRADY
		Me? Sure. Why?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Just checking.

	GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY 
	BOOTS, then starts to exit himself. 

					JAMES LEER 
		Turn out the light, please.

	GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back 
	of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the 
	wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.

2	INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 

	GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 
	45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful 
	of SLICK PROGRAMS.

					SARA 
			(calm but firm) 
		No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for 
		today. This means we have no programs for the 
		weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 
		9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw 
		Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are 
		going. 
			(shaking her head) 
		It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.

	GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. 
	There is the slightest of hesitations, then....

					SARA 
		Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
		Chancellor.

					SARA 
		I got the message you called.

					GRADY
		I got the message you called too.

	This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and 
	continue on, without so much as a backward glance. 

3	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING

	The RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box, removes a 
	JOINT as big as his pinky, and wheels his DARK MAROON '66 
	GALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus, cruising under another 
	BANNER:

	WELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28

4	EXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH 

	GRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest 
	skyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed. 

5	INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

	GRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half 
	the length of the terminal, until...

6	INT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

	...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the 
	tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black 
	dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.  
	Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the 
	woman's ear, then spots Grady.

					CRABTREE 
		Tripp!

					GRADY
		How are you, Crabtree?

					CRABTREE 
		Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss 
		Antonia. . .uh. . . .

					WOMAN 
		Sloviak.

					CRABTREE 
		I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to 
		tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you. 
		Trip? ?

					GRADY
			(a slight beat) 
		The more the merrier.

					MISS SLOVIAK 
		Terry was telling me about you on the plane. 
		It was ail so interesting.

					CRABTREE 
		I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes 
		to be published. What you do as a writer, what 
		I do as an editor...

					GRADY
		I sweat blood for five years and he checks for 
		spelling.

					MISS SLOVIAK 
			(indicating Crabtree) 
		That's exactly what he said.

					CRABTREE 
		We know each other pretty well. 
			(to Grady) 
		So where's Emily?

					GRADY
		Emily?

					CRABTREE 
		Your wife.

					GRADY
		Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

					CRABTREE 
		Perfect. Well then, shall we?

	GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the 
	architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in 
	her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.

7	INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak 
	sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.

					CRABTREE 
		Do you know how many times I've boarded an 
		airplane praying someone like her would sit 
		down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my 
		way to Pittsburgh.

					GRADY
		Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great 
		cities.

					CRABTREE 
		If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no 
		argument from me.

					GRADY
		She's a transvestite.

					CRABTREE 
		You're stoned.

					GRADY
		She's still a transvestite.

					CRABTREE 
		Mm.

					GRADY
		Isn't she?

	Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he 
	watches the carousel spin.

					CRABTREE 
		So how's the book?

	GRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so 
	soon. He tries to act casual.

					GRADY
		It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort 
		of. ..tinkering with it.

					CRABTREE 
		Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it 
		sometime this weekend. Think that might be 
		possible?

					GRADY
		I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . 
		juncture .

					CRABTREE
		I thought you were tinkering.

					GRADY
		I just mean. . .

					CRABTREE
		Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, 
		Tripp. But...
			(pointedly)
		 ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?

	GRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's 
	face brightens again.

					CRABTREE
		Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would 
		be?

	GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto 
	the carousel.

					GRADY
		That would be a tuba.

8	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8

	As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the 
	great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, 
	then glances in the rearview mirror.

					GRADY
		That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It 
		wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Why yes. How did you know?

					GRADY
		Lucky guess.

					CRABTREE
		You didn't actually purchase this car, did 
		you. Trip??

					GRADY
		It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

					CRABTREE 
		He owes God money. You know, he queered 
		himself for good with Esquire.

	GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto 
	butane.

					GRADY
		He said something about being between things.

					CRABTREE
		Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken 
		legs.

9	EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER  

	A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS 
	UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in 
	front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her 
	face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger 
	window.

					GRADY
		Hi, Tanya. 
			(to the others) 
		This is Tanya. My wife's secretary.

	CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and 
	nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.

					TANYA 
		Grady.. ..Emily's not here.

	GRADY just smiles, nods.

					TANYA (cont'd) 
		Is there anything I can do for you?

	GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through 
	Tanya's sad umbrella.

					GRADY
		You're leaking, Tanya.

	Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.

					CRABTREE
		Trip? ?

					GRADY
		She left me. Crabs.

					CRABTREE
		Left you...?  Who? Emily?

					GRADY
		This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

					CRABTREE
		But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I 
		mean, what are we doing here?

	GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his 
	windshield, turns on the ignition.

					GRADY
		I thought maybe I made it all up.

10	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING 

	Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and 
	select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of 
	cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching 
	halt across the street, parks in front of another fire 
	hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a 
	GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		That's a nice greenhouse.

					GRADY
		It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

					CRABTREE
		I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, 
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.

					CRABTREE
		Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always 
		do.

11	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE  

	As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, 
	riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.

					SARA 
		Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you 
		again. 

					CRABTREE
		Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing.

					SARA
		Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to 
		wonder if you were ever going to--oh!

	As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches 
	forward ...into Grady's arms.

					GRADY
		Easy there.

					SARA
		I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't 
		know how anyone actually walks in these things.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Practice.

	Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific 
	curiosity in her eye.

					SARA
		I don't believe we've met...

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Antonia. Antonia Sloviak--

	Just then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES 
	skitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general 
	direction of Grady.

					SARA
		Poe!

					CRABTREE
			(mildly)
		This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?

	Poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the 
	hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around 
	and is barking at the living room.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Who ' s he barking at now?

					GRADY
		He's still barking at me. He's blind.

					SARA
		Poe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.

	As Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.

					GRADY
		I need to talk to you.

					SARA
		That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. 
			(strategy in her tone)
		Perhaps you could put some of these coats in 
		the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
			(reading her)
		I don't believe I know where the upstairs 
		guest room is.

					SARA
		Well then. I'd better show you. Terry--

					CRABTREE
		We'll just make ourselves at home.
			(kneeling by Poe) 
		Won't we, Poe? Yes, yes....

12	INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM 

	GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA. 
	AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of 
	famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN 
	IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with 
	PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As 
	Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S 
	PENNANT hanging over the mantle.

					GRADY
		New?

					SARA 
			(nodding)
		Walter just got it back from the framer today.

	Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the 
	pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.

					SARA 
		You go first.

					GRADY
		All right. This morning--

					SARA 
		I'm pregnant.

	A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living  room below. 
	GRADY starts to speak.

					SARA 
		I'm sure.

					GRADY
		Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?

					SARA
		I think Walter would find this a little more 
		than surprising.

	GRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.

					GRADY
		Emily left me this morning.

					SARA
		She's left before...

					GRADY
		She's left the room before. She always came 
		back.

	Sara nods. Considers this.

					SARA
		So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry 
		each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

					GRADY
		Simple.

	GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat 
	lying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.

					SARA
		Is that Cristaile?

					GRADY
		Hm.

					SARA 
			(weary)
		My God, I wear the same scent as a 
		transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: 
		she?

					GRADY
		If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is 
		by the end of the evening.

					SARA
		Has he asked to see the book yet?

					GRADY
		Yes.

					SARA
		And? Are you going to tell him?

					GRADY
		No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm 
		going to do.

					SARA 
			(distantly) 
		Neither do 1.

	GRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.

					GRADY
		Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.

					SARA
		I guess you're going to have to chew it off 
		then.

13	INT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE   

	Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by 
	Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, 
	returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds 
	MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.

					CRABTREE
		Walter! I see you've met my friend.

					WALTER GASKELL 
		Yes . She' s charming.

					MISS SLOVIAK
			(taking her drink)
		Walter's been telling me the most fascinating 
		things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?

					WALTER GASKELL
		Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my 
		contention that their marriage tapped into the 
		very id of American popular culture. Joe 
		DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, 
		the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be 
		controversial, I personally believe every 
		woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn 
		Monroe.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Oh, I couldn't agree more.

	NEW ANGLE

	GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and 
	changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN 
	("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's 
	clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting 
	the make on Hannah Green.

					Q
		And while my latest has been on the New York 
		Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't 
		help but lament that my first book, which 
		contains what I consider my finest writing, was 
		remaindered in less than five. So, I find 
		myself conflicted.

					GRADY
		Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in 
		the Hamptons.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(brightening)
		Grady.

	Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.

					Q 
		Hello.. .Professor.

					GRADY
		Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The 
		Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' 
		material for her.

	As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the 
	other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN 
	TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.

					MAN IN TWEED 
			(to short man)
		A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm 
		telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob 
		laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa? 
		Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot 
		bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
			(as GRADY passes) 
		Grady!

					GRADY
		Hello, Nathan.

					MAN IN TWEED
		My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The 
		PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for 
		you, Grady.
			(to his friend)
		GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,

	The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.

					SHORT MAN
		Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I 
		say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon 
		of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it 
		on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years 
		running.

					GRADY
			(pulling away) 
		No wonder it's still in print.

	As GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette.

					WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
		...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy 
		fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to 
		deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover 
		the cancer in your heart every time, but God 
		forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.

14	EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT   

	GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from 
	his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around 
	the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE 
	accosts him.

					MAN'S VOICE 
		There you are.

	GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he 
	sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the 
	person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in 
	the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.  

					WALTER
		I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in 
		here. You haven't seen it, have you?

					SARA
		I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if 
		I was sitting on it.

					WALTER
		You'd recognize it if you tasted it.

					SARA
		I doubt it, darling.

					WALTER
			(angling & bottle to the light)
		Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he 
		will be addressing 500 people in little over an 
		hour...

					SARA
		You want to keep him happy.

					WALTER 
		If he' s happy. . .
			(kissing her as he exits) 
		I'm happy.

	As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in 
	the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, 
	she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, 
	returning to the clamor inside her house.

	GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of 
	LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching 
	him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's 
	garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught 
	eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the 
	porch.

					GRADY
		James?

	James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a 
	GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at 
	what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's fake.

	James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY 
	peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The 
	sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED 
	PISTOL.

					JAMES LEER
		It was my mother's. She won it in a penny 
		arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic 
		school.

					GRADY
		It's very convincing.

					JAMES LEER
		It used to shoot these little paper caps, but 
		they don't make them anymore. The caps.

	GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers 
	and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.

					JAMES LEER
		It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry 
		rabbits' feet...

					GRADY
		...You carry firearms.

	As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass 
	briefly over the jay. GRADY
	notices, offers.

					JAMES LEER
		No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of 
		my emotions.

	GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were 
		wondering. I crashed. I mean, not 
		intentionally...

	James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be 
	seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		...but the other night, Hannah and I were 
		together, at the movies, and she asked me. 
		Since she was coming. So I ended up coming. 
		Too.

	GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.

					GRADY
		Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?

					JAMES LEER 
		No! What gave you that idea?

					GRADY
		Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent 
		her a room.

					JAMES LEER
		She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
			(glancing back at the window) 
		Besides, she doesn't really know me. She 
		thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's 
		because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.

					GRADY
		Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she 
		knows it and try as she might to not let that 
		screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in 
		some way.

	James looks away from the window, at Grady.

					JAMES LEER
		You're not like my other teachers, Professor 
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		You're not like my other students, James. So 
		what was the movie you two saw?

					JAMES LEER
		Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and 
		Frances Farmer.

					GRADY
		She went crazy, Frances Farmer.

					JAMES LEER
		So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.

					GRADY
		Sounds like a good one.

					JAMES LEER 
			(a crooked smile) 
		It's not bad.

	GRADY considers James' fragile face.

					GRADY
		Listen, James, about this afternoon. In 
		workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a 
		bit out of control.

					JAMES LEER
		They really hated it. I think they hated it 
		more than any of the other ones.

					GRADY
		Well...

					JAMES LEER
		It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to 
		write.

					GRADY
			(truly impressed) 
		Really? That's remarkable.

					JAMES LEER
		I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in 
		bed I figure them out. The stories.

	As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY 
	looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat. 
	Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against 
	the modest bulk of the cap gun.

					GRADY
		You cold, James?

					JAMES LEER 
			(distant) 
		A little.

					GRADY
		So what are you doing out here?

					JAMES LEER 
		It's colder in there. -

					GRADY
			(laughing) 
		You're right.

	James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that 
	he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse

					JAMES LEER
		Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought 
		...I thought I'd come out here and take a look 
		at it. You don't see one of those every day. It 
		looks like heaven...

					GRADY
		Heaven?

					JAMES LEER
		I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in 
		heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in 
		crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the 
		way I remember it...

	Abruptly, James glances at his watch.

					JAMES LEER 
		I should be going.

	James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a 
	moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		Goodbye, Professor Tripp.

	GRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off 
	then, leaving the light of the house behind.

					GRADY
		James. 
			(as he stops)
		Don't leave just yet. There's something I 
		think you ought to see.

					JAMES LEER 
		I'll miss my bus.

					GRADY
		This is worth it.

	James looks conflicted.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Trust me.

15	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER  

	It's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past 
	the departing guests and toward the stairs.        

					HANNAH GREEN
		Hey, you two.

	GRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.

					HANNAH GREEN (cont'd) 
		Are you riding with me, James?

					JAMES LEER 
		No, I'm going ho--

					GRADY
		He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his 
		friend. All right?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Ail right. By the way, his friend...?

					GRADY
		The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. 
		Where are they exactly?

					CRABTREE
		Here we are!

	CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss 
	Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry.

					CRABTREE
			(spying James) 
		Nell, hello there.

	CRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James 
	Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.

					GRADY
		James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

					HANNAH GREEN
		James'll know about George Sanders.

					JAMES LEER 
		George Sanders?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders 
		killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

					JAMES LEER
		Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel 
		room.

	The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but 
	Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.

					CRABTREE
		How comprehensive of you.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie 
		suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.

					JAMES LEER 
		There's so many...

					HANNAH GREEN
		Just a few then. The big ones.

	James glances at the loose group of people around him, 
	watching, then...

					JAMES LEER
		Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles 
		Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 
		1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an 
		accident, but, you know. . . 
			(a trace of irony)
		He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took 
		pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he 
		hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in 
		lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more 
		pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget 
		when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot 
		himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. 
		Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret 
		Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. 
		Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 
		1978. There are more but I don't know if you 
		would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara 
		Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I haven't heard of half of those.

					CRABTREE
		You did them alphabetically.

	James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James 
	blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs 
	shyly, looks away.

					JAMES LEER
		That's just how my brain works, I guess.

					CRABTREE
		Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out 
		with us after the lecture. There's a place on 
		the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

					JAMES LEER
		Actually. ..I just want to go home.

					CRABTREE
		Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants 
		to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. 
		Just think of it as a field trip.

	As he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if 
	to say: "Bring him."   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James 
	glacially as we CUT TO:

	BLACK

	The dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR 
	opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of 
	MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.

16	INT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE   

	GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the 
	photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
	STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN 
	JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.

					JAMES LEER 
		Is that really it?

					GRADY
		That's really it.

					JAMES LEER
		The one she wore on her wedding day?

					GRADY
		So I'm told.

	James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide 
	garments, stands speechless.

					GRADY
			(cont'd) 
		Go ahead.

					JAMES LEER 
		Really?

					GRADY
		Really.

	James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he 
	reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, 
	barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.

					JAMES LEER
		They're glass. The buttons.

					GRADY
		Like the lady herself.

	GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a 
	bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the 
	jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.

					JAMES LEER
		She was small. Most people don't know that. 
		The shoulders are small.
			(touching the satin)
		It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time 
		she wore it. That day. She must've felt so 
		...happy.

	GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, 
	lifts it lightly.

					JAMES LEER
		It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... 
		something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

					GRADY
		I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth 
		about how much he pays for these things.

					JAMES LEER
		You're really good friends with the 
		Chancellor, aren't you?

	Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains 
	unchanged, consumed with the jacket.

					GRADY
			(carefully)
		Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, 
		too.

					JAMES LEER
		I guess you must be, if you know the 
		combination to his closet and he doesn't mind 
		your being here in their bedroom like this.

					GRADY
		Right.

	A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The 
	CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom 
	window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN 
	DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.

					GRADY
		We, better skedaddle. Close that closet-- 
		James? You ail right?

	James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed, 
	knapsack between his knees, head in hands.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing 
		that jacket that belonged to her. It just 
		looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a 
		closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.

					GRADY
		Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself 
		tonight.

					JAMES LEER 
		You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail? 
			(off Grady's look)
		Hannah mentioned something about it.   About a 
		note.

					GRADY
		Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we 
		should go now.

	Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light, 
	leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.

	James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.

17	INT. HALLWAY

	A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY
	as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to 
	the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in 
	Grady's direction.

					GRADY
		Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .

	GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward 
	and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.

					GRADY
		Jesus!

	GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the 
	ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his 
	head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.

					GRADY
		Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!

	Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his 
	head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, 
	growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his 
	throat, until there is a sharp...

	CRACK! CRACK!

	Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily 
	onto Grady's legs. GRADY
	turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the 
	little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.

	GRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.

					GRADY
		Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.

					JAMES LEER 
		I had to. Didn't I?

					GRADY
		Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?

					JAMES LEER
		No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1 
		thought --

					GRADY
		Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on 
		me.

	GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through 
	life with a slight overbite.

					JAMES LEER
		Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see 
		if someone's breathing.

					GRADY
		He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead 
		dog when I see one.

	James looks miserably at Poe.

					JAMES LEER
		What are we going to do?

	GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.

					GRADY
		First you're going to give me that little cap 
		gun of yours.

18	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING 

	GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield.

					JAMES LEER
		Professor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question?

					GRADY
		Yea, James.

					JAMES LEER 
		What are we going to do with...

	James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange 
	blue eyes gleaming.

					GRADY
		I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out 
		how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her 
		husband's dog.

					JAMES LEER
		You?

					GRADY
		Trust me, James, when the family pet's been 
		assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear 
		one of her students was the triggerman.

					JAMES LEER
		Does she want to hear it was one of her 
		professors?

					GRADY
		I've got tenure.

19	EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) 

	As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of 
	Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a 
	space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.

					GRADY
		Okay.

	James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs 
	looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps 
	forward, and takes the hind legs.

					JAMES LEER
		He's still a little warm.

	They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until 
	there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.

					JAMES LEER 
		Yuck.

	GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.

					JAMES LEER 
		That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a 
		suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost 
		perfectly.

					GRADY
			(searching)
		That's just what they used to say in the ads. 
		Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...

					JAMES LEER
		Whose tuba is that anyway? 

					GRADY
		Miss Sloviak's.

					JAMES LEER
		Can I ask you something about her?

					GRADY
		She is. Ah. Here we go...

	GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-
	size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of 
	boxers.

					JAMES LEER
		Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
		gay?

					GRADY
		Most of the time he is, James. Some of the 
		time he isn't. Now what do we have here?

	GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a 
	pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.

					GRADY
		Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That 
		should take the pinch out of my ankle.
			(handing the bottle to James) 
		Have one.

					JAMES LEER
		No thanks. I'm fine without them.

					GRADY
		Right. That's why you were standing in the 
		Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap 
		gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right, 
		you're fit as a fucking fiddle.

	GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, 
	drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.

					GRADY
		I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.

	Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, 
	and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, 
	he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill 
	from the lapel of his jacket.

					GRADY
		How 'bout we try that again.

20	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

	On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.

					WALTER
		...really needs no introduction. Walk down the 
		aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any 
		hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at 
		you. You all know the name, you all know the 
		books, so welcome if you will, the man those of 
		us who know him simply call.. .Q.

	As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the 
	auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an 
	open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID 
	with a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
 
					Q 
		Good evening.

	GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, 
	watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting 
	until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory 
	hush. Finally, he speaks again.

					Q 
		I am a writer.

	As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He 
	glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a 
	similar look of bafflement.

					Q (cont'd)
		As a writer, one thing you learn is that 
		everyone you encounter has a story. Every 
		bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an 
		idea or a. story that would make a "great book" 
		or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has 
		an idea. (gestures to the audience)
		But, how do you go from there to here? How do 
		you go from having an idea to having a book? 
		How do you get across? What is the bridge, the 
		bridge that allows you to walk on air from the 
		shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of 
		accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is 
		worth the telling, faith that you have the 
		wherewithal to tell it, faith that the 
		carefully woven structure you create won't 
		collapse beneath you...

	GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking 
	and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far 
	EXIT. A blink later, she is gone.

					Q (cont'd)
		...and faith that when you get to the other 
		side someone will be waiting who gives a damn 
		about the tale you have to tell.

	GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own 
	HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a 
	thread forty feet above his head...

	Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: 
	bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the 
	auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, 
	James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows 
	away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.

	GRADY blinks, turns to James.

					GRADY
		I'll be right back.

21	INT. LOBBY

	GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the 
	lobby. A PAIR. of local BOOKSELLERS, chatting quietly 
	behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors, 
	glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms. 

22	INT. CORRIDOR  

	GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor 
	begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his 
	cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes....

	BLACK FOR A 

	MOMENT AND THEN....

					SARA'S VOICE 
		Grady? Grady?

	GRADY opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above 
	him. He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy 
	blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.

					SARA
		You had another one, didn't you? You have to 
		see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday 
		morning. All right?

					GRADY
		Is the thing-is it over?

					SARA 
		Almost. Wane to sit up?
			(as he winces) 
		What's the matter?

					GRADY
		Nothing. I think I twisted my--

	GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.

					GRADY
		I have to tell you something. Something.. 
		.hard.

	Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.

					SARA
		Then stand up. I'm too old for all this 
		roiling around on the floor.

	GRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a 
	cigarette.

					GRADY
		Well...

					SARA
		Don't. I know what you're going to say.

					GRADY
		No, really, Sara, I don't think you--

					SARA
		You love Emily. I know that. And you need to 
		stay with her.

					GRADY
		I don't think I really have a choice in, that. 
		Emily left me.

					SARA
		She'll come back. That's why I'm going to. 
		..to not have this baby.

	GRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette 
	to her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the 
	floor.

					GRADY
		Not have it.

					SARA
		No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think 
		there's no way?

					GRADY
		Well, no, I don't see any way.
			(taking her hand)
		And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose 
		this chance.

					SARA
			(jerking away)
		No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. 
		And fuck you for "saying. . .
			(quietly)
		...for saying there's just no way. Because 
		there could be a way, Grady.

	Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.

					SARA
			(composing herself)
		He must be finishing. We should go.

	GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his 
	coat.  As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS 
	to the floor.

					SARA
		Who's gun is that?

					GRADY
		It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

	Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.

					SARA
		Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.

					GRADY
		Caps.

	She points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.

					SARA 
		Pow.

					GRADY
		You got me.

					SARA
		I love you, Grady.

	GRADY places his fingers gently over Sara's... and 
	removes the gun from her hand.

					GRADY
		I love you, too.

23	INT. LOBBY 

	The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges, 
	arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT.

					JAMES LEER
		Woah! The doors made so much noise!

	As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.

					JAMES LEER
		This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry 
		me out.

					GRADY
		Is he ail right?

					CRABTREE
			(rolling his eyes) 
		He's fine. He's narrating.

					JAMES LEER 
		We're going to the men's room. Only we might 
		not make it in time.

					SARA
		Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you 
		to make that mistake, wait here.

	As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the 
	lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		I need a ride.

					GRADY
		I'm your man.

24	EXT. STREET 24

	As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK 
	stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase.

					GRADY
		There's an explanation.

	MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, 
	unzips her suitcase.

25	INT.    GRADY'S CAR - MOVING   

	As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top 
	button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered 
	COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the 
	glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL 
	POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the 
		poor thing?

					GRADY
		James is. ..I don't know...

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets 
		done with him, he's going to be even more 
		disturbed.

					GRADY
		I'm not sure that's possible.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Sure it is.

	GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her 
	forehead.

					GRADY
		Listen, Antonia--

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Tony. Now that I'm home.

					GRADY
		Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so 
		well for you tonight. With Terry.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Forget it. I should've known better. Your 
		friend is just, I don't know, into collecting 
		weird tricks. Mind?

	Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.

					GRADY
		He's writing his name in water.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		What's that?

					GRADY
		Like most editors, he really wants to be a 
		writer, but he's too busy living a novel to 
		bother writing one.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a 
		shit.

					GRADY
		He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the 
		feeling he's going through the motions a bit.

	Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		You mean because his career's ruined and all?

					GRADY
		Jesus. Is that what he told you?

					MISS SLOVIAK
		He said he hasn't had a success in ten years 
		and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of 
		.a. . .

	As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse 
	of his own swollen eyes.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good 
		that he'll be able to keep his job.

	Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points.

					MISS SLOVIAK
			(cont'd) 
		Turn here.

26	EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE

	GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front 
	lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a 
	little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.

					GRADY
		That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese 
		beetle trap.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.

	The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN 
	squints through the screen door.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		There's Pop. 
			(turning)
		Let me see it. The gun.

	GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony 
	smirks.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Figures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis 
		would carry. In a little beaded purse?

	GRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the 
	front screen door. Pop is still there.

					GRADY
		I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue 
		James Leer.

	MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and 
	peers in at Grady.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think 
		about going home. You look like you need a 
		little rescuing yourself.

27	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB 

	GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS 
	stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron 
	in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then 
	slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.

27A	EXT. ENTRANCE - HI-HAT CLUB     

	As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a 
	perfunctory pat-down.

					BOUNCER 
			(kidding him) 
		Clean tonight, hub, Professor?

					GRADY
		As a whistle.

28	INT. HI-HAT CLUB

	Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY 
	enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons 
	with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her 
	glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated 
	shrug and she points.

	CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James 
	slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the 
	general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath 
	the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap.

	Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing 
	WAITRESS.

					GRADY
		Double Dickel on the rocks.

29	INT. BOOTH 

	As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately 
	and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.

					GRADY
		Is that just beer?

					CRABTREE
		Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a 
		little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You 
		missed a few bottles, by the way.

					GRADY
		I'm sure. Where is everyone?

					CRABTREE
		Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to 
		go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

	GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's 
	copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts 
	back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.

					GRADY
		Jesus. He's out.

	CRABTREE glances over, nods.

					CRABTREE
		He has a book.

					GRADY
		I know. He started it Fall semester.

					CRABTREE
		He finished it Winter Break.

	GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise.  He 
	glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall.

					CRABTREE
		So. Is he any good?

					GRADY
		No. Not yet he isn't.

					CRABTREE
		Well, I'm going to read it anyway.

					GRADY
		Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one o£ 
		my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure 
		if he's-

					CRABTREE
		He is. Take my word for it.

					GRADY
		I think it's more complicated than that. 
		Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost 
		...did something stupid tonight. At least, I 
		think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual 
		confusion thrown into the stew right now.

					CRABTREE
		On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.

					WAITRESS 
			(ducking in) 
		Double Dickel.

					GRADY
		Thanks.

	GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes 
	she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear 
	beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah 
	Green's slinky form seizes his attention.

					CRABTREE
		No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?

					GRADY
		Shut up and drink.

	CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.

					CRABTREE
		Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?

	GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but 
	it's not Oola CRABTREE
	is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.

					GRADY 
		President of the James Brown Hair Club For 
		Men.

	Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with 
	big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most 
	noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.

					GRADY
			(initiating an old game) 
		He's a boxer. A flyweight.

					CRABTREE
		Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis.. 
		.Curtis Hardapple.

					GRADY
		Not Curtis.

					CRABTREE
		Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are 
		from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and 
		got trampled.

					GRADY
		And now he's addicted to painkillers.

					CRABTREE
		He can't piss standing up anymore.

					GRADY
		He lives with his mother.

					CRABTREE
		And he had a younger brother who . . .was . . 
		. a. . .

					GRADY
		Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames 
		Vernon for his death.

					CRABTREE
			(stumped)
		Because. . .because. . .

					JAMES LEER 
			(sleepily)
		.. .he was killed, when a gangster named 
		Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite 
		horse. He took the bullet himself.

	GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens 
	one bloodshot eye to regard them.

					JAMES LEER
		Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.

	James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.

					CRABTREE
		That was good.

					GRADY
		He heard everything we were saying.

	Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me.

30	INT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          30

	GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the 
	jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a 
	sexy, measured blues.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's 
		so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail 
		your sentences always existed, just waiting 
		around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to 
		fetch them down.

					GRADY
		I thank you.

					HANNAH GREEN
		And I love the inscription you wrote to me. 
		Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think 
		I am.

					GRADY
		I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy 
		innocents we can get.

	GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say 
	something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair 
	from James Leer's forehead.

					HANNAH GREEN
		So what are you going to do?

					GRADY
		Do?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to 
		be there when you get home.

	GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then 
	catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The 
	tile that would reflect his head is missing.

					GRADY
		Are you holding me up or am I dragging you 
		down?

	Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Shush.

31	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM)       

	Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to 
	Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.

					GRADY
		Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make 
		sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I would if I knew where I was taking him.

					GRADY
		Hannah, are you telling me you don't know 
		where James Leer lives?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen 
		it.

					GRADY
		That strikes me as odd.

					HANNAH GREEN
		James is odd. I know he has an aunt in 
		Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, 
		but... 
			(remembering)
		Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's 
		house. He said she worked there. Or something. 
		I don't remember.

	James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car.

					JAMES LEER 
		Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....

					GRADY
		What's he saying?

					HANNAH GREEN
		His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's 
		always carrying around. He must've left it 
		inside.

					GRADY
		Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...

	GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. 
	CRABTREE
	and Q huddle inside.

					GRADY
		Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the 
		auditorium.

					JAMES LEER
			(delirious, but insistent) 
		Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!

	GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		All right. Take him to my place. He can crash 
		on the sofa.

					HANNAH GREEN
		The one in your office? It's the best one .for 
		naps.

					GRADY
		I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We 
		could probably stand him up in the garage with 
		the snow shovels at this point.

	As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls 
	into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.

					GRADY
		Ail right. In my office.

	As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his 
	face.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.

	GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and 
	drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has 
	his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.

	Vernon Hardapple.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		You driving this car?

					GRADY
		Excuse me?

					VERNON HARDAPPLE
		This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving 
		this car?

					GRADY
		It's mine.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.

					GRADY
		You must be mistaken.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		Bullshit.

	GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.

					GRADY
		Go home to your mother, Vernon.

32	INT. GALAXIE      

	GRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and 
	starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees 
	CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.

					GRADY

		All right, what's the matter?

	CRABTREE just keeps smiling.

					GRADY
		Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? 
		The kid's practically in a coma.

					CRABTREE
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		Yes.

					CRABTREE
		Hit your brakes.

	GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a 
	SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break 
	pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield.

					Q 
			(squinting)
		Oh my God! What is that?

	It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the 
	beams of light.

					GRADY
		What's this guy's problem?

					CRABTREE
		Just go around him.

	GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances 
	back in front of Grady's grille.

					GRADY
		Shit.

					CRABTREE
		Back up. Go out the other way.

	GRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then 
	turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind 
	the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches 
	in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high 
	wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.

	As GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.

					GRADY
		Now what?

					Q
			(mischievously)
		You could always go over him.

	Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his 
	heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto 
	the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides 
	smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the 
	night.

					Q 
		What just happened?

	GRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.

					GRADY
		I just had my car jumped on.

33	EXT. THAW HAIL - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER) 

	Grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out.

					GRADY
		Wait here. I'll be right back.

					CRABTREE
		Where would we go?

34	INT. LOBBY   

	The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging 
	the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky 
	FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps 
	his hand against the glass.

					JANITOR 
		It's open.

	GRADY pushes on the door and it opens.

					JANITOR (cont'd) 
		Hey, Professor Tripp. 
			(off Grady's look)
		Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year. 
		Then I dropped out of school.

					GRADY
		I hope it wasn't my fault.

					TRAXLER
			(taking him seriously)
		No. I guess you're here for the backpack. 

					GRADY
		Oh.. .yeah.

35	INT. AUDITORIUM       

	The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding 
	chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.


					TRAXLER
		I saw the manuscript inside. So when you 
		showed up, I figured. . .

	GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title 
	page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and 
	then, halfway down, TEXT.

					TRAXLER 
		Is it good?

					GRADY
			(reading)
		I don't know. It might be...

36     CUT

37	EXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER 

	GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and, 
	hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops.

	Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone. 

38	INT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT   

	Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the 
	original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The 
	backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.

					TRAXLER
		Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true 
		about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on 
		his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last 
		longer?

					GRADY
		Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?

					TRAXLER 
		Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, 
		aren't you?

	Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on 
	the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S 
	PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch.

					GRADY
		Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub 
		ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground 
		lamb.

					TRAXLER 
		Sick.

39	EXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

	Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street 
	from the Gaskell's house.

					TRAXLER
		Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your 
		wife?

	GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse.

					GRADY
		No, my wife's out of town.

	Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom, 
	then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway. 
	Walter appears on the front steps.

					TRAXLER (cont'd) 
		Who's that guy?

					GRADY
		Her husband.

	Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.

					TRAXLER
		What exactly are we doing here, Professor 
		Tripp?

					GRADY
			(staring at Sara) 
		Taking the long way home.

39A	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER

	As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James 
	Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above 
	the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with 
	only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He 
	takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.

40	INT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE

	GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.

41	INT. LIVING ROOM     

	The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes 
	of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he 
	finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-
	shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling 
	hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet 
	Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but 
	his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He 
	steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his 
	disappointment--only the red cowboy boots.

	He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.

42	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

	James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old 
	sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James' 
	knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects 
	his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.

	Something yellow. Something soft.

	GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing 
	a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET 
	from James Leer's ratty green knapsack. 

	GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking 
	very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the 
	light on the both of them.

43	EXT. FRONT PORCH - SATURDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY) 

	GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and 
	plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch 
	step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it, 
	then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.

44	INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER     

	As CRABTREE SNORES thunderously, GRADY eases open the 
	door, spots the CAR KEYS on the dresser, grabs them.

44A	INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS

	GRADY eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops, 
	his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from 
	Crabtree's room.

44B	INT. EMILY'S OFFICE 

	GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, 
	lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and 
	well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of 
	Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, 
	pads and pens neatly arranged alongside.

	A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate 
	mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS, 
	framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's 
	DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's 
	Daughter.

	There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck 
	with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing 
	Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR of 
	YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan.

	Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.

45	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

	GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the 
	sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.

					JAMES LEER 
			(without waking) 
		Thank you.

					GRADY
		You're welcome.

	GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee 
	from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center 
	of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a 
	clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual 
	precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP 
	that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.

	All net.

	A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without 
	further ceremony, GRADY
	turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC 
	and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:

		(beat) 2611

	In other words: Page 2611.

	CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS, 
	the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that 
	grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.

					GRADY
		James I  

	GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's 
	quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.

					GRADY
		I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

					JAMES LEER 
		I put you on the floor.

					GRADY
		Oh.

					JAMES LEER
		I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow 
		your tongue or something.
			(nodding to Grady's robe)
		I guess you really miss her, huh?

	GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets 
	of the robe, its overall fuzziness.

					GRADY
		Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write 
		in it.

					JAMES LEER
		I guess there's probably a story behind that.

					GRADY
		There is, but it's not that interesting.

	James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the 
	TELEPHONE RINGS.

					JAMES LEER 
		Want me to get that?

					GRADY
		Sure.

	As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises 
	delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to 
	see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.

					JAMES LEER 
			(returning)
		He didn't give his name.

					GRADY
		Who?

					JAMES LEER 
		The guy on the phone.

					GRADY
		What'd he say?

					JAMES LEER
		He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here 
		and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 
		with black interior.

					GRADY
		What'd you tell him?

					JAMES LEER
		Yes.

					GRADY
		Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be 
		sure to mention the back door pops open with a 
		couple hard shakes to the right.

					JAMES LEER
		I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or 
		something. Is that single-spaced?

	James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on 
	Grady's desk.

					GRADY
		Afraid so.

					JAMES LEER
		That's a big book you're writing.

					GRADY
		I think it's sort of writing itself at this 
		point.

					JAMES LEER
		Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, 
		but--

					GRADY
		But . . . ?

					JAMES LEER
		Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been 
		awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some 
		people--some of the kids in workshop--thought 
		maybe you were...

					GRADY
		Washed up?

					JAMES LEER 
		Blocked.

					GRADY
		Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.

	James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.

					JAMES LEER
		No kidding.

	A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch 
	Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, 
	materialize in the hallway.

					CRABTREE
		Good morning, boys. James.

	James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.

					GRADY
			(re: James' "attire") 
		If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, 
		I'd put on something a little less comfortable 
		if I were you.

	As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the 
	page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare 
	into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE 
	seems to have made him suddenly queasy.

					JAMES LEER 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Hm.

					JAMES LEER 
		How did I get here last night?

					GRADY
		No one seems to know where you live, James. 
		Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

					JAMES LEER
		And ...and before that. Did I do anything? 
		Anything bad?

					GRADY
		Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the 
		English Department's dog and steal his most 
		prized piece of memorabilia.

	As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY 
	looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now 
	parked at the bottom of his driveway.

					GRADY
		Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.

46	EXT. FRONT PORCH

	A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the 
	door opens, GRADY
	appears.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		Good morning... 
			(eyeing Grady's robe)
		Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but 
		I understand you attended an event at Sara and 
		Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one 
		of the last to leave...

47	INT. LANDING - SAME TIME                                  47

	James lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the 
	sleeping bag, straining to hear.

					OFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)
		...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. 
		Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of 
		place. Suspicious maybe...

48	EXT. FRONT PORCH 

	GRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought.

					GRADY
		Well, there's always people you don't know at 
		these things, but I can't say there was anybody 
		particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one 
		guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		A jockey? You mean, like--

					GRADY
		Horses, right. Vernon something...
			(thinking... )
		Hardpple

	Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		Hardapple?

					GRADY
		I could be wrong. What happened anyway?

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's 
		closet. And the dog's missing.

					GRADY
		That's weird.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's 
		blind and we figure he just wandered off and 
		got run over.

					GRADY
		The perpetrator.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		No, the dog.

					GRADY
		Just kidding.

	Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing 
	With Assholes."

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		One other thing. About this kid, this student 
		of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know 
		how I could get in touch with him, would you?

					GRADY
		I might have his number on campus.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		That's all right. We'll find him.

	Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and 
	turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...

					HANNAH GREEN (O.S.) 
		There you are...

	GRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across 
	the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy-
	eyed and delectable.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I thought we were going to talk. Last night.

					GRADY
		Oh. Well. I...

	Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up 
	her thighs.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.

	GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes 
	through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is 
	heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down 
	the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik 
	drive away in his big police car.

					JAMES LEER 
		What do we do now?

#####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him 
#####RINGS.

					GRADY
		Hello?

					SARA'S VOICE
		Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You 
		won't believe what's happened.

					GRADY
		Could you hold on a minute, honey?

	With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever-
	so- gently ...hang up the phone.

					GRADY
		How 'bout we get the hell out of here?

49	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 

	James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath 
	his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack 
	swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of 
	KEYS.

					GRADY
		You start her up.

	As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice 
	blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the 
	keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides 
	behind the steering wheel.

					JAMES LEER
			(as the engine roars) 
		How's that?

					GRADY
		Well done, James.

	As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the 
	wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Shit!

	James blinks, pokes his head out the window.

					JAMES LEER
		You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.

50	INT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)   

	GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a 
	neighborhood MARKET. GRADY
	has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering 
	his ragged thumb.

					GRADY
		Where exactly do you live, James?

	James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of 
	ORANGE JUICE, stops.

					GRADY
		Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as 
		to the location of your apartment.

	GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic 
	hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.

					JAMES LEER
		I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked 
		out. I was asked to leave.

					GRADY
		I guess there's probably a story behind that.

					JAMES LEER
		There is, but it's not that interesting.

					GRADY
		So where have you been staying?

					JAMES LEER 
			(a long pause) 
		The bus station.

	GRADY stares incredulously at James.

					JAMES LEER
		It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor. 
		And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.

					GRADY
			(trying to fathom this) 
		But James. I mean. ..How long?

					JAMES LEER
		A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had 
		the gun. For protection.

					GRADY
		Jesus, James, you should've told someone.

					JAMES LEER 
		Who?

					GRADY
		I don't know...
			(unconvincingly)
		Me.

	GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, 
	abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling 
	on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is 
	staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST 
	PAPERBACK. GRADY
	frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a 
	spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.

	A thought evolves.

					GRADY (cont'd)
			(the balloons)
		What do you think of these?

	James takes another chug from his jug, nods.

					JAMES LEER 
		Nice.

51	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING 

	Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared 
	ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in 
	front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.

52	INT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS  

	GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches 
	something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James 
	glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the 
	glovebox, then peers at the house.

					JAMES LEER 
			(the house) 
		Isn't this...?

					GRADY
		Hm.

	GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange 
	juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.

					GRADY
		You better ease off that stuff, James. It's 
		pretty acidic.

	James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, 
	studies it curiously.

					JAMES LEER
		I can't help myself. I don't know what's the 
		matter with me.

					GRADY
		Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you 
		think's the matter with you?

	As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers 
	the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets 
	the donut in precisely the same place.

53	INT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER

	Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the 
	balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the 
	balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.

					SARA O.S.) 
		Feeling guilty?

	GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized 
	behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.

					GRADY
		Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this 
		morning. Can you talk?

	Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.

					SARA
		Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for 
		WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole 
		Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, 
		too.

					GRADY
		I-heard.

					SARA 
		You heard? How?

					GRADY
		A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house 
		this morning.

					SARA 
		Did you confess?

	GRADY looks up, mildly alarmed.

					SARA
		Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

					GRADY 
		Really? That was fast.

					SARA 
			(frowning)
		I'm kidding. Hello?

					GRADY
		Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There 
		is something I need to tell...

					SARA
		Are you limping? Why are you limping?

					GRADY
		Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to . 
		. .

					SARA
		Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall 
		somewhere?

					GRADY
		No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I 
		don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell 
		you something.

					SARA 
		All right.

	Sara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting.

					GRADY
		I...

	As GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
		 ...want to be with you.

	Sara looks at him.

					SARA
		Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I 
		don't know whether to swoon or smirk.

					GRADY
		Really, Sara, I...

	Sara holds up one gloved hand.

					SARA
		I believe you. I believe you want to be with 
		me. But this is not just about me anymore.

					GRADY
		I know that. I know what's at stake here...

					SARA
		No, I don't think you do. And besides... I 
		haven't decided yet.

					GRADY
		About the baby.

					SARA 
		That ...and you.

	GRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop 
	them on  a table.

					SARA
		I'm not going to draw the map for you on this 
		one, Grady. Times like these you have to do 
		your own navigating.

	Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the 
	street.

					SARA
		Who's that sitting in your car?

					GRADY
		James Leer.

					SARA 
		What's he doing out there?

					GRADY
		I'm sort of helping him work through some 
		issues.

	Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.

					SARA 
		Isn't he lucky.

	GRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the 
	house, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers 
	a limp hand in return, but it's too late.

	She's already gone.

54	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - LATER 54

	GRADY cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw, while James 
	sits stiffly, the orange juice jug bobbing between his 
	thighs.

					JAMES LEER
		She seemed to take it pretty well.

					GRADY
		Yeah, well, actually. . .

	James looks over.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		The moment didn't really present itself.

	James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window, 
	staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. GRADY 
	glances at him. At the orange juice jug.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		You' re not planning on puking in my car, are 
		you, James?

	Nothing.

					GRADY
		Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley 
		Heights. We could find you a nice golf course 
		to barf on.

					JAMES LEER 
			(sharply) 
		No.

	GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James 
	blinks, looks embarrassed.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...

	James peers out the window at passing landscape.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		I've got a thing about, ..places like this. I 
		know what those houses are like. I know what 
		the people are like.

					GRADY
		Your aunt ?

	James turns, eyes flashing with surprise.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Hannah mentioned something about an aunt.

	James nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes 
	a JOINT between his fingers, sniffs it.

					JAMES LEER 
		Humboldt County?

					GRADY
			(surprised)
		Maybe...

					JAMES LEER
		It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.

					GRADY
		Glaucoma?

					JAMES LEER 
		Colon cancer.

					GRADY
		Jesus, James. Wow.

	James puts the joint back in the ashtray.

					JAMES' LEER
		It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a 
		small town.

					GRADY
		Where's that?

					JAMES LEER
		Carvel.

					GRADY
		Carvel? Where's Carvel?

					JAMES LEER 
		Outside Scranton.

					GRADY
		I never heard of it.

					JAMES LEER
		It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin 
		factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five 
		years.

					GRADY
		Your father worked in a mannequin factory?

					JAMES LEER
		Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn. 
		She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before 
		that, she'd been a dancer.

					GRADY
		What kind of dancer? .

					JAMES LEER
		Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

					GRADY 
			(in disbelief)
		James Leer, are you telling me your mother was 
		a stripper?

					JAMES LEER
		I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. 
		And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's 
		clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a 
		bad debt.

					GRADY
		Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic 
		school?

					JAMES LEER 
		When we fall, we fall hard.

					GRADY
		Amazing.

	GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then 
	notices-with surprise--James has his hand out.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		I thought you were the guy who didn't like to 
		lose control of his emotions.

					JAMES LEER
		Maybe I just needed the moment to present 
		itself.

55	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER)

	GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a 
	modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the 
	JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.

					JAMES LEER
		This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy 
		would live. What's it called again?

					GRADY
		Kinship.

					JAMES LEER
		Kinship. And what's here?

					GRADY
		Unless I miss my bet...my wife.

	James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.

					JAMES LEER 
		The one that left you?

					GRADY
		That's right. That one.

56	EXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE

	GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against 
	the glass of the living room window, squints inside. 
	Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the 
	hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's 
	sitting in the indentation.


					JAMES LEER
		Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-

					GRADY
		How can you tell?

					JAMES LEER
		You can see the outline of a butt.

	As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.

					GRADY
		Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you 
		can start on the box.

58	EXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER)

	As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows.

					JAMES LEER
		Maybe she didn't come here.

					GRADY
		She came here. We'll just wait. In the 
		meantime, I need you to shimmy through.

	James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch 
	door.

					GRADY
		Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since 
		she was twelve years old. And your hips are as 
		slim as hers.

					JAMES LEER
		It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you 
		know-of what's in the car. In the trunk.

					GRADY
			(a pang of guilt himself)
		Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about 
		that.

	James takes another sad glance at the little door, then 
	drops onto ail fours.

59	INT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER     

	GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it 
	speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that 
	people will gather together, light a fire, talk.

					JAMES LEER 
		It feels really... good. ..here.

					GRADY
		I know. It's the house you want to wake up in 
		on Christmas morning.
			(moving off)
		Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

60	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 60

	Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a 
	DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of 
	quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels 
	of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a 
	PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.

	One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and 
	finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, 
	standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their 
	wedding day.

61	INT. DEN     

	James enters, FRENCH ROLL in hand, and sees a REMOTE 
	CONTROL atop the BAR. Taking it, he points it at the WIDE- 
	SCREEN TELEVISION imbedded in the opposite wall and, 
	seconds later, GEORGE SANDERS walks into his CLOSE-UP.

					GEORGE SANDERS
		There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr. 
		Gray. All influence is immoral...

62	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME  

	Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed 
	next to a huge TEDDY BEAR.

					GRADY
			(into phone)
		Yes, I' m looking for the Chancellor... I 
		don't know. She should be in the main hall 
		...Thank you.

63	INT. DEN     

	James runs through the channels, pauses on MARTIN MILNER 
	and GEORGE MAHARIS, riding in their curvy Corvette.

64	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME   

	A Nelson Riddle's THEME FROM ROUTE 66 BOOMS from below, 
	GRADY
	cups a hand over his ear.

					GRADY
		Sara? Hi. It's Grady.

					SARA'S VOICE
		Where are you, Grady? An elevator?

					GRADY
		I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some 
		things we need to talk about...

					SARA'S VOICE
			(evenly)
		You're in Kinship?

					GRADY
		Yes. But that's not why I called...

					SARA'S VOICE
		With Emily?

					GRADY
		What? No'. There's no one here. I'm just 
		...just....

					SARA'S VOICE
		Just what? Doing a little dusting?

	As GRADY endeavors to respond, TWO YOUTHFUL VOICES, 
	CHEERFULLY SINGING, rise from below.

					CHEERFUL VOICES       
		Good Morning! Good Morning!

					GRADY
			(yelling)
		James! For Christ sake, will you turn that 
		thing down!

					SARA'S VOICE
		James? He's still with you?

65	INT. DEN 

	James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of 
	Bushmills, smiles as JUDY GARLAND and MICKEY ROONEY sing 
	their hearts out in Babes In Arms.

					JUDY/MICKEY
		We talked the whole night through!

66	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 

	GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the 
	bedroom WINDOW.

					GRADY
		Look, Sara. ..I'm not here. ..I'm not here to 
		. . .

	As GRADY watches, a late-model PONTIAC BONNEVIlLE turns 
	into the driveway below him.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		 ...reconcile with Emily.

					SARA'S VOICE
		Are you there to not reconcile with her?

	The Bonneville's trunk pops open, revealing THREE BAGS OF 
	GROCERIES, and HANK and IRENE WINTERS, both in their 60's, 
	get out. An enormous NEWFOUNDLAND vaults from the backseat.

	Sara, eating phone static this whole time, interprets 
	Grady's silence her own way.

					SARA'S VOICE (cont'd) 
		Goodbye, Grady.

					GRADY
		No. Sara, you don't understand...

					SARA'S VOICE
		Trust me, I understand. I just want to say 
		something to you, Grady.

					GRADY
			(dreading it) 
		Yea?

					SARA'S VOICE
		How you choose to live your own life is your 
		business. But you be careful with that boy, 
		Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.

	As the line goes dead, GRADY watches Hank and Irene 
	Winters disappear below him.

69	INT. DEN       69

	James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt 
	County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy 
	and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation. Then, sensing 
	something ...he turns.

	Hank and Irene Winters, grocery bags in arm, stand 
	frozen.

					JAMES LEER     
		Hullo.

	FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the staircase and GRADY hobbies 
	into view. He tries a smile.

					GRADY
		Mom. Dad.

70	INT. DEN - WINTERS HOUSE - (A BIT LATER) 

	Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of 
	tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool.

					HANK
		Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm 
		just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you 
		to-find someone who knows what they're doing. 
		Here. Put your foot up.

	GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a 
	BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back 
	cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look 
	consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author 
	is himself.

					HANK
		So he's one of your students, this boy?

	GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene 
	sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James 
	is looking out the window, a curious expression on his 
	face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland 
	sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances 
	back into the living room, he and James make brief eye 
	contact, then blink, look away.

					GRADY
		Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed 
		up.

					HANK
		Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll 
		be fine.

	GRADY tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with 
	him?--but Hank gives nothing away. GRADY nods to the book.

					GRADY
		What made you pull out that old thing?

					HANK
			(shrugging)
		I was thinking of you.

					GRADY
		And?

					HANK
		It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you 
		know that. It's a young man's book. It got me 
		remembering how it felt to be young.

					GRADY
		Maybe I should read it.

					HANK
		Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you 
		aging prematurely, Grady.

	GRADY doesn't have to read Hank's face this time.

					GRADY
		Where's Emily, Hank?

					HANK
		I 'don't know if she'd want me  to tell you 
		that, Grady.

					GRADY
		I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just. 
		..want to know where I stand.

	Hank looks up, incredulous.

					HANK
		Where you stand?

					GRADY
			(embarrassed)
		l-just want to say I'm sorry.

					HANK
		She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The 
		neurologist.

					GRADY
		Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?

					HANK
			(frowning)
		Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley 
		together.

					GRADY
			(sheepishly)
		Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot 
		of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I 
		have the book to finish and--

					HANK
		Ah, right. The book.

	GRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something 
	in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks 
	away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James 
	again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I 
		didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want 
		you to know that.

					HANK
		Why did you come here, Grady?

	GRADY gestures vaguely.

					GRADY
		I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily. 
		And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let 
		everyone know that, even though it may be 
		difficult to comprehend now, this-everything 
		that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't 
		mean "Goodbye."

					HANK
		Give me a break, Grady.

	Hank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle.

					HANK
		You're done.

71	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - DUSK   71

	GRADY glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up 
	against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting 
	out any heat.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm having a really good time, Professor 
		Tripp.

	GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc.

					GRADY
		I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a 
		favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's 
		not for amateurs.

	James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat 
	LEVER.

					JAMES LEER 
		I just wanted a little sip.

					GRADY
			(squinting at him)
		I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, 
		exactly what point was it that you turned into 
		Serpent Boy?

					JAMES LEER
		Probably about the time you gave me the 
		codeine pills last night.

	GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose 
	face bears not the slightest trace of irony.

					GRADY
		Jesus... 
			(thinking, then. . . )
		Look, James, you appear to possess-like many 
		an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a 
		rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which 
		dreams are made. However, I 'think it's best 
		if, for the moment at least
			(taking the Ziploc)
			...we abstain.

					JAMES LEER 
		You're mad at me, aren't you?

					GRADY
		What?

					JAMES LEER
		You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's 
		dog.

					GRADY
		It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's--
			(stopping)
		Who said anything about girlfriend?

	James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you 
	kidding?

					GRADY
		Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my 
		girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't 
		exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no 
		reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, 
		the fact remains that I'm the one who took you 
		up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one 
		who has to take the blame. I- don't know what 
		the hell I was thinking.

					JAMES LEER
		Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap 
		gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 
		'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he 
		might never get on the bus again.' You were 
		thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract 
		this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a 
		noble act.

					GRADY
		Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never 
		done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever.

	James looks -out the window, pondering this.

					JAMES LEER
		So, why did you take me up there?

					GRADY
			(feeling for the heat again)
		I -don' t know, James . I don' t know why I do 
		half the things I do. Who does?
			(looking over)
		Why do you wear that coat?

	James looks down, a little defensive.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's warm.

					GRADY
		James, fall semester, first day of class, it 
		was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.

	James just blinks, no ready answer-available.

					GRADY
		That's why they all give you such a hard time 
		in workshop.

					JAMES LEER 
		Because of my coat?

					GRADY
		Because you act like a goddamn spook all the 
		time. Not to mention the fact that every last 
		one of them is jealous of you.

					JAMES LEER 
			(smirking) 
		Jealous? Of me?

					GRADY
		Not you. Your talent.

	James' face hardens. He looks away.

					JAMES LEER 
		You're lying.

					GRADY
		The hell I am.

					JAMES LEER
		Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You 
		said so yourself.

					GRADY
		I never said that.

					JAMES LEER
		Yes you did. Last night. To your friend 
		Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you 
		said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.

					GRADY
		I didn't mean it that way.

					JAMES LEER
		It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, 
		the others--they 're right. My stories are 
		annoying. They go on and on and on, and the 
		longer they go on the more annoying they 
		become, until finally you just want to grab 
		something heavy and--

					GRADY
		Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and 
		Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking 
		about, okay? The entire class combined-
		including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one 
		tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

	James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the 
	window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in 
	them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.

					JAMES LEER 
		But, last night...

					GRADY
		Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I 
		was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a 
		dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me 
		some slack?

					JAMES LEER 
			(quietly) 
		I'm sorry.

					GRADY
		And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares 
		what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a 
		good writer? You want to be-a great writer? 
		Then stop giving a damn what other people 
		think. Most of them haven't thought in .years.

	James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the 
	first headlights of the evening.

					GRADY
		Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books 
		don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not 
		anymore.

					JAMES LEER
		Arsonist's Daughter meant something.

	GRADY smiles contemptuously.

					JAMES LEER
		I mean it. It means something to me. It's one 
		of the reasons I came to school here. To be in 
		your class. To be taught by you.
			(quietly)
		It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a 
		writer.

	GRADY stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away 
	before the wide sweep of the Galaxie's headlights.

					GRADY
		Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I'm 
		sorry.

72	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL - OFF THE HIGHWAY - EVENING 

	GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James 
	slides out. GRADY
	stays put, hands still on the wheel.

					JAMES LEER
		You coming?

					GRADY
		In a minute. Get us a table.

	James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee 
	shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a 
	table with a view of the highway. GRADY
	watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into 
	the booth and open his big, laminated menu.

	Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY 
	kicks open his door, steps out.

73INT/	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER  

	GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he 
	speaks.

					GRADY
		C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm 
		sure. It's outside Scranton.

	GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by 
	himself on the far side of the coffee shop.

					GRADY
		You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at 
		this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a 
		resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd 
		be pretty interested to learn that the good 
		people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his 
		entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this 
		up as I go along--

	GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Never mind. My mistake.

74	EXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT     74

	GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An 
	AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of 
	CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows 
	peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch.

	He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice: 
	James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it 
	says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE 
	NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the 
	Greyhound depot who picks up.

75	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)

	The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as 
	he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE 
	PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars 
	that whip by on the highway beyond the window.

					JAMES LEER 
		Want a bite?

					GRADY
		No thanks.

					JAMES LEER
		That's why you're having them. Your spells.

					GRADY
		Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like 
		we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't 
		have spells.

					JAMES LEER 
		What would you call them then?

					GRADY
		I don't know. ...'Episodes.'

	James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.

					JAMES LEER
		It's because you don't eat.

					GRADY
		I eat.

					JAMES LEER
		When?

					GRADY
		When nobody's looking.

	GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...

					JAMES LEER
			(mouth full, garbled)
		I just worry about you, that's all.

	...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks 
	at him.

					GRADY
		You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?

					JAMES LEER
		Okay.

	Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against 
	the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking 
	lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		Where you going?

					GRADY
		Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.

	GRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and 
	his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.

76	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL   

	As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER 
	MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming 
	BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a 
	WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of 
	the sun visor.

					MAN
			(eyeing GRADY dubiously) 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Grady.

					MAN
		Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda.

					GRADY
			(re: their clothes)
		Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening.

					FRED LEER
		Hardly.

					AMANDA LEER
		We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck 
		would have it, the club was on the way, so... 
			(snapping shut the visor)
		We were able to put in an appearance.

					FRED LEER
		Otherwise we would've been here earlier.

					GRADY
		Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a 
		little dinner.

					FRED LEER
		Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.

					GRADY
		That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might 
		be good for James to be with his family this 
		weekend.

					FRED LEER
		Well, of course, we can understand that.

	GRADY considers the two glittering ghosts before him. 
	They seem to be waiting. Just waiting.

					GRADY
		Well. Let me go get him.

	GRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		I "hope you won't consider this forward of me, 
		Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you 
		ever attend Catholic school?

	Amanda Leer's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly.

					AMANDA LEER 
		Excuse me?

77	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP77 

	James is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not going with them..

					GRADY
		James. Listen. Things-things are a little 
		weird with me right now and I-- well--I have 
		enough blame to shoulder these days without 
		having to take the blame if something bad 
		happened to you. And if you hang around me long 
		enough, something bad is going to happen, trust 
		me. That's why I need you to go home. 
		Understand?

					JAMES LEER 
		I'm not going, with them.

					GRADY
		James, like it or not, they're your parents.

					JAMES LEER
		Parents? They're not my parents. They're my 
		grandparents. My parents are dead.

	GRADY stares at-James wearily.

					JAMES LEER
		I swear. My father had his own airplane he 
		used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and 
		my mom were flying up to our house in the 
		Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in 
		the newspaper.

	GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.

					JAMES LEER
		I 'swear. My father was a senior vice 
		president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite. 
		Her maiden name was Guggenheim.

	GRADY starts to protest, then pauses.

					GRADY
		I remember that. Five or six years ago.

					JAMES LEER
		Six. Their plane went down right outside 
		Scranton.

					GRADY 
			(sardonically) 
		Near Carvel?

					JAMES LEER
		I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like 
		to talk about my family. They treat me like a 
		freak. 
			(nodding towards Amanda)

	She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's 
	mine. My parents left it to me.

	GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the  
	contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.

					GRADY
		James, come on. That man is obviously your 
		father. You look just like him.

	James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and 
	speaks in a voice heavy with implication.

					JAMES LEER
		There's a reason for that.

	Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little 
	riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.

					GRADY
		Get out of here.

					JAMES LEER
		That's why she hates me. That's why she makes 
		me sleep in the basement.

					GRADY
		In the crawl space, with the rats and the 
		casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.

	As GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a 
	plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it.

					JAMES LEER 
		I swear.

78	EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER       78

	As Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes, GRADY 
	waves vaguely, peers into the darkness of the back seat.

					FRED LEER 
		Thank you. Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
		Take care of him.

					AMANDA LEER
		Oh, don't worry. We'll take care of him. You 
		can be sure of that.

	Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in 
	a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee 
	down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at 
	his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front 
	passenger seat, James' knapsack. GRADY grabs it, turns.

					GRADY
		Hey!

	GRADY'S POV - REAR WINDOW
	as the Mercedes begins to pull away and James turns, 
	elbows on the back dash, his pale face slack. Spying Grady, 
	he raises one limp hand, and then-as if it were held by a 
	string-lets it drop.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(softly) 
		Hey.

79	EXT. PARKING LOT - MQTEL/COFFEE SHOP - A. BIT LATER   

	GRADY sits in-the GREEN GLOW of .the radio dial, smoking 
	a joint. He glances at the knapsack, sees James' 
	MANUSCRIPT:

	The Love Parade

	He reaches in, takes the manuscript and, in the light 
	that rains from the PARKING LAMP overhead, begins to read.

80	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)      80

	Grady's HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block 
	full of nuns. MUSIC BLARES, LIGHT BLAZES from every window, 
	and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the 
	Galaxie in the middle of the street.


					GRADY
			(knowingly) 
		Crabtree.

81	INT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER  

	Times Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans 
	the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs.

82	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE  

	Hannah Green sits on the sofa, twisting a long strand of 
	hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT.

					GRADY
			(entering) 
		Hey.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Grady!

	She slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at 
	her thigh. GRADY
	stares. The manuscript. It's his.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(embarrassed)
		I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, 
		just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist 
		and-and--I suck.

					GRADY
		No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it 
		out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been 
		in here, has he? Poking around?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I don't know--maybe- I don't think so.

	Grady's  mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but 
	only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that 
		aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.

					HANNAH GREEN
		He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The 
		blind one.

					GRADY
		Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What?

					HANNAH GREEN
		At first the police thought he just ran away, 
		but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood 
		spots on the carpet -

					GRADY
		Jesus.

					HANNAH GREEN
		CRABTREE said it sounded like something James 
		would be messed up in.

					GRADY
		Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Who does?

	Just then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway 
	outside.

					CRABTREE (O.S.) 
		Trip?! Where are you'

	GRADY looks anxiously toward the door.

					GRADY
		The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James 
		that day?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I told you, Sewickly Heights.      

					GRADY
		But where? I need the street.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a 
		corner. 

					CRABTREE (O.S.)
		Trip?!

					GRADY
		Shit.

	As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger 
	inside his belt buckle.

					HANNAH GREEN
		No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for 
		you.

	GRADY looks at Hannah's hand, where it rests. He looks 
	terrified.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but 
		right now I--

					CRABTREE
			(bursting in)
		Tripp, where the hell. . .

	CRABTREE stops, takes in the tableau before him.

					CRABTREE (cont'd)
		Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student-
		teacher conference?

	GRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle, 
	points at Crabtree.

					GRADY
		You stay there.

					CRABTREE
		What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

	CRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked 
	on Grady's desk.

					CRABTREE
		Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would 
		sneak in here and read your book without asking 
		you?

					GRADY
		Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to 
		remember you actually asking me if you could 
		invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

					CRABTREE
		Sometimes we have to improvise.

					GRADY
			(ignoring him)
		Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I 
		mean, besides you and. ..me?

					CRABTREE
		James? My James? What's happened?

					GRADY
		Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't 
		know.. .kidnapped.

					CRABTREE
		Kidnapped? By who?

					GRADY
		His parents.

					CRABTREE
		Good God. Let's go rescue him.

					GRADY
		Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don't 
		know where they live.

					CRABTREE
		Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know 
		where he lives.

					GRADY
		It's a little late to call Admissions.

					CRABTREE
		Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?

					GRADY
		Maybe ...I don't know.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Two-sixty-two Baxter Drive.

	GRADY and CRABTREE turn, see Hannah sitting on the corner 
	of Grady's desk with the WHITE PAGES open on her lap.

					HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)
		They're in the book.

83	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - TEN MINUTES LATER

	CRABTREE snaps James' manuscript closed.

					CRABTREE
		You know--based on what I've read-- this is a 
		very exciting piece of material, this Big 
		Parade.

					GRADY
		Love. It's Love facade--and what do you mean 
		'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two 
		chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling 
		methamphetamines.

					CRABTREE
		I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I 
		feel this kid in my bones.

					GRADY
		Only in your bones?

	GRADY smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise; 
	CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay. He 
	just stares out the window, his voice distant.

					CRABTREE
		No. I think I might be right. I've felt it 
		before...

	As Crabtree's voice trails off, GRADY studies him.

					GRADY
		How bad is it for you?

					CRABTREE
		Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit 
		the new corporate profile.

					GRADY
		Which is?

					CRABTREE
		Competence.

	GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment, then 
	CRABTREE smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James' 
	knapsack, rummaging through the contents.

					CRABTREE (cont'd) 
		So tell me about you and the Chancellor.

					GRADY
		What's to tell?

					CRABTREE
		Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...

	CRABTREE fishes out the biography of Erroll Flynn, gives 
	it a look.

					CRABTREE
		...I like her.

	GRADY peers at the stars, his voice barely audible.

					GRADY
		Me too.

84	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SEWICKLEY HEIGHTS     84-

	The battered Galaxie floats up a narrow road, gliding 
	through a canyon of mansion walls and the occasional 
	winding drive. Up ahead a stone post marker with the 
	numerals "262." GRADY kills the headlights.

					GRADY
		This is it.

84A	EXT. LEER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Grady--limping like an aging prizefighter--leads CRABTREE 
	up a steep incline toward an enormous three-story house. 
	The Leer's Mercedes gleams in the shadows.

					CRABTREE
		Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on . 
		that thing. How are we-supposed to find his?

					GRADY
		I told you. They keep him chained in the 
		basement. Come on.

85	EXT. REAR - LEER HOUSE

	LIGHT GLOWS from a low BASEMENT WINDOW. From one side, a 
	WOMAN is HEARD SINGING. GRADY and CRABTREE pause, listen.

					WOMAN SINGING 
		Why should I care though he gave me the air? 
		Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why? 
		And wonder why?

					CRABTREE
		Doris Day.

	CRABTREE and GRADY look at each other.

					GRADY/CRABTREE
		James Leer.

	GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass. A moment 
	later, James peeks out. Seeing Grady, his face brightens 
	briefly, unguarded, then quickly resumes its usual Leerian 
	aspect. He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."

86	EXT. BASEMENT DOOR    

	The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in 
	a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the 
	seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.

					JAMES LEER
		Hey. What are you guys doing here?

					CRABTREE
		We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on.

	As they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once-
	over.

					GRADY
		I can't believe you made fun of my robe.

87	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT    87

	Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose 
	walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There 
	are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and 
	an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY.

					CRABTREE
		I like what you've done with it. When's 
		Captain Nemo moving in?

					JAMES LEER 
		The candelabras were my Gran's.

					GRADY
		Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll 
		leave you here.

					CRABTREE
		Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the 
		grandparents, the China town thing-- and I 
		believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now 
		go get dressed.

	James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning.

					JAMES LEER
		Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this 
		again. Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Ah, wear whatever you want.

	James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.

					CRABTREE
		So modest.

					GRADY
		So sensitive.

					CRABTREE
			(nosing around the room)
		Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.

					GRADY
		It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just 
		once I'd like to know if the little bastard is 
		telling the truth.

					CRABTREE
		The-truth. I know that's always been real 
		important to you. Key, check this out...

	CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from 
	the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage.

					CRABTREE
		Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to: 
		see him, shuffling into the room like an aging 
		prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.'
			(with an amused smile) 
		Sound like anyone we know?
			(resuming) 
		But it was later, when the great man squinted 
		into the bitter glow or twilight...
			(frowning)
		Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely 
		needs an editor.
			(resuming)
	...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it. 
	Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the 
	boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in 
	a darker place. His heart...'

	CRABTREE stops abruptly.

					GRADY
		Yes? 'His heart...'

	CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:

					CRABTREE
		'His heart, once capable of inspiring others 
		so completely, could no longer inspire so much 
		as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It 
		beat now only because it could. '

	GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns.

					JAMES LEER 
		I'm ready...

	James stops, sees the two men looking at him.

					JAMES LEER 
		You all right, Professor Tripp?

					CRABTREE
		He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol' 
		Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.

					JAMES LEER
		Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming 
		down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, 
		check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call 
		the police or.. .something.

					CRABTREE
		Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows 
		and one of your teddy bears under the spread 
		and she won't know the difference.

					JAMES LEER 
			(brightening)
		Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use 
		a couple big hams.

					GRADY
		No.

	CRABTREE and James turn.

					GRADY
		I've got something better than a teddy bear.

	CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' 
	bed. 

88	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 

	GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently 
	adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps 
	back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment.

					GRADY
		Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

89	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - LATER 

	The lights are still blazing, the front door is wide 
	open, but not a soul remains.

90	INT. LIVING ROOM

	A quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on 
	the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the 
	TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and 
	GRADY appear.

					CRABTREE
		Things must've picked up after we left.

	CRABTREE pats Grady's cheek, heads upstairs. 

91	INT. HALLWAY

	Crabtree's door is closing as GRADY hobbles into view.

					GRADY
		Crabtree.

					CRABTREE
			(sticking his head out) 
		Ye-es?

	GRADY looks down, sees James Leer's black brogues sitting 
	on the floor outside Crabtree's door.

					GRADY
		Nothing.

	The door closes, the LATCH CLICKS, and GRADY is left 
	alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air.

92	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM 

	Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by 
	little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her, 
	then detects something on the floor. The red boots.

	Delicately, he lifts the sheet. Hannah Green's feet-- 
	finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be 
	thick, wide, and ordinary. GRADY
	sighs.

93	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE 

	The TV is on. GRADY steps to the doorway, pauses.

					VOICE 
		Hey.

	A HEAD cranes over the sofa. It's the Goatee Kid from 
	Thaw Hail.

					GRADY
		How are you--is it Joe?

					GOATEE KID
		Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your 
		house until about an hour ago.

					GRADY
		Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.

					GOATEE KID
		Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, 
		what I said that time in office hours-I hope 
		there's no hard feelings.

					GRADY
		No...

					GOATEE KID
		I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at 
		the time and my car was ail fucked up and--
		well--I was pretty bent in general.

					GRADY
		It's cool, Jeff. Really.

					GOATEE KID
		I just want you to know that's why I dropped 
		your class and said all that shit about the 
		university stealing my money and you being a 
		pseudo-Faulknerian nobody.

94	EXT. PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (A BIT LATER)

	GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in 
	his fingers. To his left, perched atop a Haagen-Dazs 
	container, is a TELEPHONE. As he pulls it into his lap, a 
	LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free of 
	the cord, and SHATTERS on the floor.

	GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the 
	CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears. 
	Stenciled on its side panel is:

	Kravnik's Sporting Goods

	The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past 
	Grady's house and disappears around the corner. GRADY 
	frowns, then realizes a MAN'S VOICE is coming from the 
	RECEIVER in his lap.

					MAN (O.S. ) 
		Hello? Hello...?

	The VOICE is groggy. It is Walter Gaskell's voice.

					GRADY
		Walter?

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Yes?

	GRADY says nothing, as if wondering what he's doing.

					WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd) 
		Who's this ?

					GRADY
		It's Grady, Walter.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Grady?

					GRADY
		GRADY Tripp. English Department.

					WALTER'S VOICE
		I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, 
		Grady, do you know what time it -is?

					GRADY
			(looking at his watch)
		I have ...eight-fifteen. That's not right, is 
		it?

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		It's three-thirty, Grady.

					GRADY
		This is important.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Oh? 

					GRADY
		I... I...

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		What is it, Grady?

					GRADY
		I'm in love with your wife.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Excuse me?

					GRADY
		Sara. I'm in love with her.

	Silence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even, 
	administrative.

					WALTER'S VOICE
		Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now.

	GRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice.

					GRADY
		No. 

					WALTER'S VOICE
		Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office 
		Monday morning.

	As the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone, 
	wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's 
	just done.

95	EXT. GRADY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY)

	A CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling 
	from-the window.

96	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

	A heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks. 
	Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the 
	piece of paper curling from his typewriter.

	GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE

	It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time. 
	Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD. 
	GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the 
	curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara.

97	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE

	GRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a 
	BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn..

					GRADY
		Sara.

					SARA
		I tried to call, but apparently there's 
		something wrong...

	Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was 
		ringing loud and clear this morning.

	GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure 
	it's not good.

					GRADY
		Oh?

					SARA
		It seems one of our students is - missing and 
		his parents found a dead dog in his bed.

					GRADY
			(slumping to the porch)
		I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. 
		It's all my-

	Sara raises her hand, silencing him.

					SARA
		I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. 
		But more importantly, Walter's not very happy 
		and he's gotten the police involved. They seem 
		to think James Leer is somehow responsible for 
		all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where 
		James is, would you, Grady?

					GRADY
		Inside.

					SARA 
		And the jacket?

					GRADY
		Over there. In the backseat of the...

	Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to 
	the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil 
	stain roughly the shape of North Dakota.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Someone stole my car.

					SARA
		Grady.

					GRADY
		Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it 
		right there last night.

					SARA
		Are you sure you parked it there?

					GRADY
		Of course, I'm sure.  Ah, Christ, the puberty 
		police are back.

	Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb.

					SARA
		I'll deal with this. You dig up James.

98	INT. CRABTREE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The 
	Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the 
	. sole visible part of .James Leer.

					GRADY
			(swinging in)
		Is he awake?

					CRABTREE
		I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

					GRADY
		Nevertheless. There's a police officer 
		standing on the porch and I don't think he's 
		going away.

					JAMES LEER
			(from under the covers) 
		That same guy?

	CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one 
	eye.

					JAMES LEER 
		You snore.

					CRABTREE
		So I hear.

					JAMES LEER 
			(studying Grady)
		No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look 
		sorta crappy.

					CRABTREE
		He's right, you look horrible.

					GRADY
		Thank you, Frankie and Annette.

	James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks 
	bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's the Chancellor.

					CRABTREE
		Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.

					GRADY
		And we both thank you for that, but we're... 
		we're... fine.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.

	GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants.

					GRADY
		Shut up, James.

					CRABTREE
		So what's the problem?

					GRADY
			(a tad tense)
		There is no problem. Did I say there was a 
		problem?

	As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned 
	flannel, he and CRABTREE
	exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and 
	excluding Grady.

					SARA (0. S.)
		How's it coming back there, Professor Tripp?

					CRABTREE
		Who's that?

					GRADY
		Who do you think it is?

					CRABTREE
		The Chancellor's here? Now?

					GRADY
		Evidently. 
			(calling)
		Coming!     

					JAMES LEER
		Does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?

					GRADY
		It's Walter's dog and yes, she does. Know. But 
		let's spare her the details. Come on, your 
		shoes are in the hail.

					CRABTREE
		James. This book of yours. It's not bad. Not 
		bad at all.

	James stops, considers this piece of news with a look of 
	deep seriousness, then nods.

					JAMES LEER 
		Thank you.

					CRABTREE
		You're welcome.

	As James shuffles off into the hail, CRABTREE looks at 
	Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement.


					CRABTREE
		I want to publish this.  I've got to.  I think 
		they'll let me.  With a little editorial 
		guidance it could be brilliant. 

					GRADY
		Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out 
		there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been 
		awhile since somebody wrote a good book in 
		jail.

99	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Sara and GRADY stand by as Pete Pupcik deposits James in 
	the back of the squad car, SLAMS the door.

	PUPCIK
	As I told the Chancellor, Professor, I'm. just going to 
	run James here over to the university. It'll be up to Dr. 
	Gaskell where we go from there.

	GRADY nods, leans in the window to James.

					GRADY
		Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		I'm a little worried, James.

					JAMES LEER 
		Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I 
		probably should be expelled.

					GRADY
		Well, let's see if we can keep that from 
		happening.

	James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car.

					JAMES LEER
		Professor Tripp...?

					GRADY
		Yes, James.

					JAMES LEER
		Even if I end up going to jail....

	James smiles his crooked grin.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		You're still the best teacher I ever had.

	On this,  Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing 
	on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in 
	the rear  window of the police car, growing smaller.

					SARA
		This is not what the university has in mind 
		when it promises a liberal education, Grady.

					GRADY
		Would Walter really press charges?

					SARA
		It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs 
		pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit 
		prickly this morning.

	Grady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches 
	her take a drag on her cigarette.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		You didn't happen to call the house last 
		night, did you, Grady?

					GRADY
		I think I might have.

					SARA
		And what do you think you might have said?

					GRADY
		I think I might've said I was in love with 
		you.

	Sara's face remains .unchanged.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		He told you.

					SARA 
		He told me.

					GRADY
		And what did you say?

					SARA
		I said it didn't sound like you. 

	Sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her 
	car, and dives away.  GRADY looks after her sadly, then 
	turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt 
	which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."

					CRABTREE
		So- what do we do now? ,

					GRADY
		Find the jacket.

					CRABTREE
		Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that?

					GRADY
		First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her 
		car.

					CRABTREE
		It seems to me that girl would let you borrow 
		her pancreas.

100	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM   - 100

	Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she 
	listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the 
	foot of-her bed, fully clothed.

					GOATEE KID
		I'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent 
		homosexual love. Look at the way they dance--
		it's sodomy.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(laughing) 
		Stop it.

	Hannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes. 
	She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Grady. Hi. What's up?

	Jeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily.

					GOATEE KID
		I'll be ...somewhere else.

					GRADY
		Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in 
		discussing that business with the tango, try 
		the guy at the end of the hall.

	Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks.

					GRADY
		He cribbed that from Borges.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It beats 'What's your major?'

	GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.

					GRADY
		Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could 
		borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of 
		commission.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to. 
		..to your book.

	The hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a 
	cloud.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I uh, I didn't finish, I ...fell asleep.

					GRADY
		That good, hub?

					HANNAH GREEN
		No, it's not that, it's...

	Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her 
	dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It's just that, you know, I was thinking about 
		how, in class, you're always telling us '-that 
		writers make choices--at least the good ones. 
		And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the 
		book isn't really great-I mean, really great-
		but at times it's, well, very detailed, you 
		know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses 
		and ail the dental records and so on-and I 
		don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of 
		reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... 
			(with trepidation)
	...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was 
	wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you 
	wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.

					GRADY
			(stung)
		Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as 
		shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first 
		writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, 
		it might interest you to know that one book I 
		wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' 
		happened to win a little something called the 
		PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under 
		the influence. '

	Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels 
	ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathers 
	his manuscript and exits.

101	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER   

	Crabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's 
	arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs.

					CRABTREE
		Want some help with that?

					GRADY
			(passing by)
		Don't touch it.

102	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT - MOVING  

	CRABTREE sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling 
	Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random. 
	GRADY rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his 
	clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a 
	watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic.

					CRABTREE
		Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes 
		you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his 
		car.

					GRADY
		Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't 
		exactly Jerry's to give.

					CRABTREE
		So whose car is it?

					GRADY
		My guess-Vernon Hardapple.

					CRABTREE
		The hood jumper?

					GRADY
		He said a few things that lead me to believe 
		the car's his.

					CRABTREE
		Such as.

					GRADY
		'That's my car, motherfucker.'

					CRABTREE
		Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. 
		We find the car...

					GRADY
		...we find the jacket.

					CRABTREE
		There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know 
		his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we 
		made the whole guy up.

					GRADY
		No wonder he screwed us over.

	CUT TO:

	BILL MAZEROSKI legendary Pittsburgh Pirate second 
	baseman, large as a Macy's Day float, his weathered image 
	scaling three floors on the BRICK face of a RIVERFRONT 
	STOREFRONT.

103	INT. HANNAH'S CAR

	CRABTREE takes a corner recklessly, immediately slows, 
	and blinks in amazement.

					CRABTREE
		Christ, Tripp. How did you know?

					GRADY
		Call it a hunch.

	Parked in front of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS is the white 
	van. A few feet behind, the battered Galaxie.

					CRABTREE
		I'd call it genius.

	GRADY steps out, strips off the robe, and drops the lumpy 
	leviathan that is his manuscript on the front seat.

					GRADY
		It's good to know I'm still talented at 
		something. Keep the motor running.

104	EXT./	INT. GALAXIE    104

	GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND 
	that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at 
	him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box, 
	and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets it 
	anyway, then spies something else.

	James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL.

	GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS 
	off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a 
	SWEET, SOFT BLUR...

105	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT 

	CRABTREE stomps on his Kool. GRADY looks very much like a 
	man who has pulled off the road to take a nap.

					CRABTREE
		What the hell...

106	INT. GALAXIE

	As GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel, a CLOUD 
	appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and GRADY realizes 
	it's not a cloud at all, it's

	MARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror, wearing a 
	bright pink dress under her wedding jacket.

					MARILYN 
		I know you. . .

	Marilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's 
	something wrong with it. This girl's eyes are brown and 
	besides, she's ...fat.

					MARILYN (cont'd) 
		Double Dickel on the rocks.

	The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds- 
	standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn 
	Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from 
	the Hi-Hat Club.

					GRADY
		Oola.

					OOLA 
		I never forget a drink.

					GRADY
		I never forget an Oola.

	Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.

					MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) 
		Forget me?

	GRADY starts to turn, but his head won't  move: largely 
	because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his 
	temple. Grady's eyes slide.

					GRADY
		Vernon.

					VERNON
			(to Oola)
		Move away, cupcake.  He's got a gun.

					GRADY
		Who's got a gun?

					VERNON 
		You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

					GRADY
		Relax, Vernon...

					OOLA 
		Why's he calling you Vernon?

					VERNON
		Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's 
		why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.

					GRADY
		Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. 
		Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon 
		Peabody at Penguin U.K.

					VERNON 
		Shut up. 
			(to Oola)
		Cupcake. Please. Inside.

					OOLA 
		You' re not going to shoot him, are you?

					VERNON
		I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that 
		gun down.

					GRADY
		It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the 
		caps anymore.

					VERNON
		Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And 
		that's a gun.

					GRADY
		No, really....

	GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled 
	pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead.

107	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT

	CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's 
	arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.

					CRABTREE
		Holy shit.

108	EXT. KRAVNIKS 

	Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned.

					VERNON 
		Are you crazy!

	The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares 
	at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand.

					VERNON (cont'd)
		Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you 
		see the condition my girl's in?

	As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on 
	Oola's tummy.

					VERNON 
		You all right, cupcake?

					OOLA 
		Who's Vernon?

	A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching 
	asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah 
	Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them.

					VERNON 
		What the...?

	Gears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails 
	wildly, then kicks open the passenger door.

					CRABTREE
		Tripp! Run!

	GRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as 
	CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then 
	turns back for another pass.

					VERNON
		Who the hell is that?

					GRADY
		A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon 
		girl's clutch.

	The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree-- 
	swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken 
	flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady, 
	Vernon, and Oola.

					VERNON 
		Woah.

	Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine.

					VERNON (cont'd) 
		Pull off, you crazy motherfucker!

	Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and 
	the oncoming Crabtree.

					GRADY
		No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver.

	CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the 
	passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a 
	FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky.

	Only, these ain't birds.   - ^

					GRADY
		Oh... my... God! 

	These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages.

	CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and 
	smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI 
	painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS.

	As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free 
	of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail 
	the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the 
	Ohio River. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
			(to Vernon)
		I take it back.  Shoot him. 

109	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING

	Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE 
	puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly 
	with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED 
	PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.

					CRABTREE
		Naturally you have copies.

					GRADY
		I have an alternate version of the first 
		chapter. 

					CRABTREE
		You'll be all right then.  Look at Carlyle, 
		when he lost his luggage.

					GRADY
		That was MacCaulay.

					CRABTREE
		Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those 
		stories.

					GRADY
		He was never able to reproduce them.

					CRABTREE
		Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to 
		depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a 
		sense- this--
			(nodding to the pages)
		is for the best.

	Grady's eyes shift, study Crabtree.

					GRADY
		Kind of a sign, you're saying.

					CRABTREE
		In a sense.

					GRADY
		I don't think so. In my experience, signs are 
		usually a lot more subtle.

					VERNON
		Let me get this straight. All that paper that 
		went into the river. That was the only copy?

					GRADY
		'Fraid so.

					VERNON
			(glowering at Crabtree)
		And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What 
		the fuck's the matter with you?

					CRABTREE
		I'm just saying that sometimes, 
		subconsciously, a person will put themselves in 
		a situation-perhaps even create that situation-
		in order to have an arena in which to work out
		an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you 
		will, of addressing a problem.

	Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if he's from another planet.

					VERNON
		I'll tell you the problem. You behind the 
		wheel. There's your fucking problem.

					CRABTREE
		That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?

					VERNON
		Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights 
		in the middle of the street none of this 
		happens.

					CRABTREE
		Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun 
		to his head?

					VERNON
		He was trying to steal my car!

					GRADY
		Ail right, all right It's done. There's no 
		need to talk about it. It's done.

	They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns, 
	glances at GRADY
	and his little sheaf of pages.

					OOLA 
		So what was it about? 
			(as GRADY looks up)
		Your book.  What was the story?

	GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.

					GRADY
		I don't know...

	Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend, 
	genuine compassion in his eyes.

					CRABTREE
		What he means is, it's difficult to distill 
		the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in 
		the mind.

					VERNON
		Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, 
		right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was 
		about, why were you writing it?

					GRADY
		I couldn't stop.

110	EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE

	Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with 
	CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare 
	to leave in the Galaxie.


					GRADY
		Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?

					VERNON 
		Shoot.

	GRADY glances at little round Oola.

					GRADY
		Boy or girl?

					VERNON
		As long as it looks like her, I don't care. 
		You know what I'm saying?

	GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.

					GRADY
		Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

					VERNON
		No sweat. Only do me a favor?

					GRADY
		Sure.

					VERNON 
		Stop calling me Vernon.

	CRABTREE leans into Grady, WHISPERS.

					CRABTREE
		The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...

					OOLA 
		Yea?

	GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, 
	snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.

					GRADY
		It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had 
		small shoulders, like you. Most people don't 
		know that.

	As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.

					VERNON
		Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty 
		motherfucking ride.

	Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into 
	Grady, and pulls away. CRABTREE stands stunned.

					CRABTREE
		You mind explaining what you just did?

	GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping 
	NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.

					GRADY
		Came to my senses. CRABTREE

		Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is 
		James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell 
		to come to his?

					GRADY
		Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer 
		to jail, Crabs. I know that.

					CRABTREE
		Do you know he won't expel him?

					GRADY
		No. But I don't think that matters.

					CRABTREE
		That's very enlightened, Professor. It's 
		comforting to know that America's children have 
		you for a teacher.

	GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the 
	buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.

					GRADY
		Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell 
		them what you know. You tell them to find their 
		voice and stick with it, because that's all you 
		have in the end. You tell the ones who have it 
		to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't 
		to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way 
		to get where you're going. 
			(ruefully) 
		Of course, it helps if you know where you want 
		to go. 
			(thoughtfully)
		Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--
		that's made the last seven years worthwhile.

	GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles 
	cryptically as he considers it. -

					GRADY (cont'd)
		As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...

	Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		He's got you.

	CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, 
	watches GRADY walk away.

					CRABTREE
		Me? What can I do?

					GRADY
		Gee, I don't know, Crabs...
			(over his shoulder)
		Improvise. You're good at that.

	GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as 
	he walks toward the buildings in the distance.

					CRABTREE
		I'm sorry, Tripp.

	GRADY stops, turns.

					GRADY
		You peeked, didn't you?

					CRABTREE
		I peeked. 

	GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter 
	anymore

					CRABTREE
		It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a 
		lot to admire. I've ...never read anything 
		quite like it.

	If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, 
	Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, 
	and show. And GRADY knows it.

					GRADY
		You're not just trying to make me feel better?

	CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.

					CRABTREE
		Scout's honor.

	CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are 
	acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.

					GRADY
		Well, thanks for that, Crabs.

111	INT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT 

	Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the 
	stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.

112	INT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks.

	He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two 
	afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill 
	breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the 
	barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. 
	turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his 
	pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his 
	manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half 
	length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner 
	down into a triangle along the first crease...

113	EXT. QUAD  

	A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER 
	AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring 
	then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.

114	INT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER

	GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the 
	auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies 
	Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.

					GRADY
		Sara!

	Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles 
	forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.

					Q
		Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look 
		at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's 
		a description of a bald cypress that left' me 
		breathless.

					GRADY
			(pushing past him)
		Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank 
		teller's breasts in your last one.

115	INT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL

	GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way 
	behind the back row, scanning the aisles.

					GIRL'S VOICS 
		Hey, Professor Tripp.

	It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. 
	GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- 
	next to her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the 
		aisle.

					GRADY
		No...

	But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the 
	aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming. 
	The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to 
		be in workshop?

					GRADY
		Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango 
		dancers.

116	INT. MAIN STAGE

	Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.

					WALTER
		And now, as those of you who've been with us 
		in previous years know, we have a tradition of 
		sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of 
		course, of The Plums.

	An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as 
	Walter begins to read from a separate list.

					WALTER
		This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock, 
		found a publisher for her children's book. The 
		Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.

117	INT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^

	As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause, 
	GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his 
	surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the 
	front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily 
	complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing 
	CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.

					WALTER
		And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for 
		his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has 
		found a home with Putnam for his new Three 
		Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.

	A SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE 
	takes a shift in tone.

					WALTER
		Now, this next one, I think, is especially 
		exciting to announce, because it concerns a 
		student here at the university. Our own James 
		Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has 
		found a publisher for his first novel, which I 
		believe is called The Lovely Parade.

	GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile 
	warmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in 
	the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned, 
	Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
		I have a class with him.

	James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the 
	APPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know 
		what I mean.

	Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups 
	Hi his hands around his mouth.

					GRADY
		Take a bow, James!

	James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish 
	grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and 
	takes his first sweet public bow.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(softly)
		Wonder Boy.

					WALTER
		And finally--and perhaps not least 
		importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has 
		also decided to publish my own book--a critical 
		exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and 
		Joe DiMaggio and its function in American 
		mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled 
		The Last American Marriage.     "

	Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically, 
	watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.     
	. :

					WALTER 
		Until next year. Thank you, everyone.

	The LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE 
	shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah 
	Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms 
	around James.

	GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when 
	suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says 
	something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. 
	GRADY blinks, scrambles up.

118	INT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY bursts into the corridor.'

					GRADY
		Sara!

	Its empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL 
	DOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.

119	INT. NEW CORRIDOR

	Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He 
	moves to it, pushes past...

120	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans 
	out over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very. 
	steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of 
	basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and 
	a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.

	GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes 
	against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his 
	ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of- 
	marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating 
	atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The 
	SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're 
	Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.

	It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.

					GRADY
		Yo, Traxler.

					TRAXLER 
			(looking up)
		Hey, Professor Tripp.

	GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.

					GRADY
		Do you get high, Sam?

					TRAXLER
		Only when I'm working.

	GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc.  It 
	pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's 
	feet.

					TRAXLER 
		Holy shit. Are you serious?

					GRADY
		As a heart attack.

					TRAXLER
		Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...

	GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy 
	now. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on 
	a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...

	...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON 
	caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.

					SARA
		Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?

	GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.

					GRADY
		Looking for you.

	He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL 
	GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...

	faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's 
	name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH 
	upward until we see that she is...

	KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.

121	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue 
	plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the 
	curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips 
	slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW 
	fall outside.

	The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then 
	the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. 
	His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.

					GRADY
		I passed out.

					GREENHUT
		You did.

					GRADY
		I've been doing that a lot lately.

					GREENHUT
		So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of 
		marijuana, I understand.

					GRADY
		Do you think that's why I've been having 
		these...
			(grabbing James' term)
		 ... spells?

					GREENHUT
		How long have you been having them?

					GRADY
		The last month maybe.

					GREENHUT
		How long have you been smoking marijuana?

					GRADY
		Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

					GREENHUT
		That's probably not the problem, then. What 
		about your lifestyle. Any major changes 
		recently?

					GRADY
		I've been trying to finish a book...

					GREENHUT
		And your wife left you.

					GRADY
		Is that in my chart?

					GREENHUT
		I spoke with the woman who saved your life. 
		You're lucky she came along when she did.

	GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this 
	statement

					GRADY
		I know.

					GREENHUT
			(tapping the glucose bottle)
		You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An 
		internist. And I think you really ought to 
		consider seeing a therapist, as well.

					GRADY
		She told you about. . .

					GREENHUT
		Her dog, yes.

					GRADY
		Actually, it was her husband's dog...

	Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the 
	first time, and GRADY
	stops.

					GREENHUT
		Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all 
		right? On top of that, you have a bite on your 
		ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you 
		with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another 
		day or two and you might have lost the foot. As 
		for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result 
		of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.

					GRADY
		They're anxiety attacks? That's a little 
		disappointing.

					GREENHUT
		Better luck next time.

					GRADY
		So is my friend...is Sara still here?

					GREENHUT
		No. There's no one here.

					GRADY
		I have to see her. As soon as possible.

	Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in 
	his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.

					GREENHUT
		Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, 
		I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a 
		prescription for a course of ampicillin and I 
		want you to follow it to the end-no matter how 
		stupid you decide to be with everything else. 
		All right?

122	INT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON

	GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around 
	him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that 
	connects one building to another.

					GRADY
		I wonder if you could show me something. 

123	EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES 
	on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple 
	and crazy with veins.

					GRADY
		Are these the only ones you have?

	The nurse's eyes crinkle.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Kidding... 

124	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,     looks at 
	the Gaskell house.

125	EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER

	GRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window.  
	Dark.  He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, 
	standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting 
	onto its roof, melting.

126	EXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S

	GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the 
	glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he 
	pulls away, but not before leaving...

	...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the 
	frost of the glass.

127	EXT. STREET  127

	The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the 
	street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self 
	on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. 
	..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little 
	pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, 
	then looks up into the sky.

	GRADY'S POV - of the SKY... 

	...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters 
	the silence.

	NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his 
	hand.

					GRADY
			(as if addressing God) 
		Is that a suggestion?

	GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO 
	SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen 
	DS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops. 

	GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts 
	himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara 
	makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- 
	not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.

					GRADY
		I'm so glad to see you, Sara.

					SARA
		I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you 
		out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?

					GRADY
		I'm through improvising. 

					SARA
		Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true? 
		Did you lose it all?

					GRADY
		I lost it ail.

					SARA
		Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.

					GRADY
		I know.

					SARA 
		And you're old.

	Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her 
	fingers. Yanks.

					GRADY
		Ouch. How many?

					SARA 
		Dozens. It's very sad.

	Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes 
	when she looks into his, and-she glances away.

					GRADY
		I went and looked at-some babies just now.

					SARA
		Oh?

					GRADY
			(trying to make her laugh)
		I guess you have to go on faith.

					SARA
			(she doesn't)
		Some times...

	GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the 
	HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.

					GRADY
		Did you tell Walter?

					SARA
		I told Walter. 

					GRADY
		Does he still love you?

					SARA
		It didn't come up. 

	GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious 
	profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.

					GRADY
		Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I 
		didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been 
		waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're 
		who I need. Because nothing makes sense without 
		you. Because the best moment of every day is 
		the moment I first see your face. And because 
		when you leave a room, there's no reason to be 
		in it any more. It's just a room again.

	Sara cocks her head.

					SARA 
		Did you just make that up?

					GRADY
			(shaking his head)
		In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about 
		it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy 
		painkillers.

	She frowns good-naturedly. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Even so...it's still true. Every word.

	Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might 
		tell you...

	Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...

					SARA 
		Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.

	GRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.

					GRADY
		You don't deserve me, you know.

					SARA
		I know, but sometimes... 

	Sara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening. 

					SARA (cont'd) 
		You just go on faith.

	GRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, 
	drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other 
	side of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door, 
	the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft 
	veil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are 
	lost too, nothing more than a blur.


	THE END
WONDER BOYS

                BASED ON THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL CHABON

                       Screenplay/Steve Kloves

	January 21, 1999 (Pink Revision) 
	January 15, 1999 (Blue Revision) 
	December 18,1998


	All IS A BLUR. . .

	...then WORDS appear, twisting and vaguely transparent, 
	reflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he 
	reads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES.

					GRADY
		'The young girl sat perfectly still in the 
		confessional...

1	INT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON

	Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is 
	in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college 
	STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.

					GRADY
		...listening to her father's boots scrape like 
		chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then 
		grow faint, then disappear altogether.'

	As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, 
	perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE 
	BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:

	WELCOME TO WORDFEST

	GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if 
	they've been on a field trip to the DMV.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(a wave of the pages) 
		So. .Anyone?

	A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN 
	sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES 
	LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the 
	window.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
		Let me get this straight. The girl with the 
		big lips is depressed because, each night, when 
		her father goes off to work at the bakery, her 
		mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the 
		house. Not only does this girl have to listen 
		to her mother working this guy in the next 
		room, she has to wash the sheets each morning 
		before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of 
		this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy 
		takes her to confession--only, once she gets in 
		the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and 
		realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is 
		that it?

	James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY 
	OVERCOAT he wears.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?

					GRADY
		All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, 
		shall we? Howard, what about you?

					HOWARD 
		I hated it.

					GRADY
		That's not exactly what I meant by 
		constructive, Howard.

					HOWARD 
		I think James should try to be more 
		constructive. This is my second semester with 
		him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me 
		want to kill myself.

	GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. 
	Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the 
	raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. 

					GRADY
		Yes, Hannah?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I think maybe we're missing the point. It 
		seems to me James' strength as a writer is that 
		he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us 
		like adults. He respects us enough to forget 
		us. That takes . . . courage .

	GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.

					GRADY
		Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I 
		think. 
			(as the students rise) 
		Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And 
		remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to 
		tonight's cocktail party need to have them at 
		the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.

	Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.

					GRADY
		Thanks for that. He all right?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I think so. ..What about you?

					GRADY
		Me? Sure. Why?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Just checking.

	GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY 
	BOOTS, then starts to exit himself. 

					JAMES LEER 
		Turn out the light, please.

	GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back 
	of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the 
	wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.

2	INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 

	GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 
	45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful 
	of SLICK PROGRAMS.

					SARA 
			(calm but firm) 
		No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for 
		today. This means we have no programs for the 
		weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 
		9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw 
		Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are 
		going. 
			(shaking her head) 
		It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.

	GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. 
	There is the slightest of hesitations, then....

					SARA 
		Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
		Chancellor.

					SARA 
		I got the message you called.

					GRADY
		I got the message you called too.

	This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and 
	continue on, without so much as a backward glance. 

3	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING

	The RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box, removes a 
	JOINT as big as his pinky, and wheels his DARK MAROON '66 
	GALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus, cruising under another 
	BANNER:

	WELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28

4	EXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH 

	GRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest 
	skyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed. 

5	INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

	GRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half 
	the length of the terminal, until...

6	INT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

	...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the 
	tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black 
	dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.  
	Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the 
	woman's ear, then spots Grady.

					CRABTREE 
		Tripp!

					GRADY
		How are you, Crabtree?

					CRABTREE 
		Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss 
		Antonia. . .uh. . . .

					WOMAN 
		Sloviak.

					CRABTREE 
		I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to 
		tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you. 
		Trip? ?

					GRADY
			(a slight beat) 
		The more the merrier.

					MISS SLOVIAK 
		Terry was telling me about you on the plane. 
		It was ail so interesting.

					CRABTREE 
		I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes 
		to be published. What you do as a writer, what 
		I do as an editor...

					GRADY
		I sweat blood for five years and he checks for 
		spelling.

					MISS SLOVIAK 
			(indicating Crabtree) 
		That's exactly what he said.

					CRABTREE 
		We know each other pretty well. 
			(to Grady) 
		So where's Emily?

					GRADY
		Emily?

					CRABTREE 
		Your wife.

					GRADY
		Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

					CRABTREE 
		Perfect. Well then, shall we?

	GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the 
	architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in 
	her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.

7	INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak 
	sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.

					CRABTREE 
		Do you know how many times I've boarded an 
		airplane praying someone like her would sit 
		down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my 
		way to Pittsburgh.

					GRADY
		Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great 
		cities.

					CRABTREE 
		If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no 
		argument from me.

					GRADY
		She's a transvestite.

					CRABTREE 
		You're stoned.

					GRADY
		She's still a transvestite.

					CRABTREE 
		Mm.

					GRADY
		Isn't she?

	Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he 
	watches the carousel spin.

					CRABTREE 
		So how's the book?

	GRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so 
	soon. He tries to act casual.

					GRADY
		It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort 
		of. ..tinkering with it.

					CRABTREE 
		Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it 
		sometime this weekend. Think that might be 
		possible?

					GRADY
		I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . 
		juncture .

					CRABTREE
		I thought you were tinkering.

					GRADY
		I just mean. . .

					CRABTREE
		Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, 
		Tripp. But...
			(pointedly)
		 ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?

	GRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's 
	face brightens again.

					CRABTREE
		Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would 
		be?

	GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto 
	the carousel.

					GRADY
		That would be a tuba.

8	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8

	As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the 
	great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, 
	then glances in the rearview mirror.

					GRADY
		That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It 
		wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Why yes. How did you know?

					GRADY
		Lucky guess.

					CRABTREE
		You didn't actually purchase this car, did 
		you. Trip??

					GRADY
		It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

					CRABTREE 
		He owes God money. You know, he queered 
		himself for good with Esquire.

	GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto 
	butane.

					GRADY
		He said something about being between things.

					CRABTREE
		Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken 
		legs.

9	EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER  

	A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS 
	UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in 
	front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her 
	face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger 
	window.

					GRADY
		Hi, Tanya. 
			(to the others) 
		This is Tanya. My wife's secretary.

	CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and 
	nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.

					TANYA 
		Grady.. ..Emily's not here.

	GRADY just smiles, nods.

					TANYA (cont'd) 
		Is there anything I can do for you?

	GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through 
	Tanya's sad umbrella.

					GRADY
		You're leaking, Tanya.

	Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.

					CRABTREE
		Trip? ?

					GRADY
		She left me. Crabs.

					CRABTREE
		Left you...?  Who? Emily?

					GRADY
		This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

					CRABTREE
		But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I 
		mean, what are we doing here?

	GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his 
	windshield, turns on the ignition.

					GRADY
		I thought maybe I made it all up.

10	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING 

	Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and 
	select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of 
	cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching 
	halt across the street, parks in front of another fire 
	hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a 
	GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		That's a nice greenhouse.

					GRADY
		It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

					CRABTREE
		I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, 
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.

					CRABTREE
		Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always 
		do.

11	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE  

	As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, 
	riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.

					SARA 
		Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you 
		again. 

					CRABTREE
		Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing.

					SARA
		Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to 
		wonder if you were ever going to--oh!

	As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches 
	forward ...into Grady's arms.

					GRADY
		Easy there.

					SARA
		I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't 
		know how anyone actually walks in these things.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Practice.

	Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific 
	curiosity in her eye.

					SARA
		I don't believe we've met...

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Antonia. Antonia Sloviak--

	Just then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES 
	skitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general 
	direction of Grady.

					SARA
		Poe!

					CRABTREE
			(mildly)
		This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?

	Poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the 
	hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around 
	and is barking at the living room.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Who ' s he barking at now?

					GRADY
		He's still barking at me. He's blind.

					SARA
		Poe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.

	As Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.

					GRADY
		I need to talk to you.

					SARA
		That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. 
			(strategy in her tone)
		Perhaps you could put some of these coats in 
		the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
			(reading her)
		I don't believe I know where the upstairs 
		guest room is.

					SARA
		Well then. I'd better show you. Terry--

					CRABTREE
		We'll just make ourselves at home.
			(kneeling by Poe) 
		Won't we, Poe? Yes, yes....

12	INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM 

	GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA. 
	AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of 
	famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN 
	IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with 
	PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As 
	Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S 
	PENNANT hanging over the mantle.

					GRADY
		New?

					SARA 
			(nodding)
		Walter just got it back from the framer today.

	Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the 
	pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.

					SARA 
		You go first.

					GRADY
		All right. This morning--

					SARA 
		I'm pregnant.

	A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living  room below. 
	GRADY starts to speak.

					SARA 
		I'm sure.

					GRADY
		Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?

					SARA
		I think Walter would find this a little more 
		than surprising.

	GRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.

					GRADY
		Emily left me this morning.

					SARA
		She's left before...

					GRADY
		She's left the room before. She always came 
		back.

	Sara nods. Considers this.

					SARA
		So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry 
		each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

					GRADY
		Simple.

	GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat 
	lying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.

					SARA
		Is that Cristaile?

					GRADY
		Hm.

					SARA 
			(weary)
		My God, I wear the same scent as a 
		transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: 
		she?

					GRADY
		If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is 
		by the end of the evening.

					SARA
		Has he asked to see the book yet?

					GRADY
		Yes.

					SARA
		And? Are you going to tell him?

					GRADY
		No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm 
		going to do.

					SARA 
			(distantly) 
		Neither do 1.

	GRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.

					GRADY
		Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.

					SARA
		I guess you're going to have to chew it off 
		then.

13	INT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE   

	Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by 
	Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, 
	returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds 
	MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.

					CRABTREE
		Walter! I see you've met my friend.

					WALTER GASKELL 
		Yes . She' s charming.

					MISS SLOVIAK
			(taking her drink)
		Walter's been telling me the most fascinating 
		things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?

					WALTER GASKELL
		Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my 
		contention that their marriage tapped into the 
		very id of American popular culture. Joe 
		DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, 
		the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be 
		controversial, I personally believe every 
		woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn 
		Monroe.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Oh, I couldn't agree more.

	NEW ANGLE

	GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and 
	changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN 
	("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's 
	clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting 
	the make on Hannah Green.

					Q
		And while my latest has been on the New York 
		Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't 
		help but lament that my first book, which 
		contains what I consider my finest writing, was 
		remaindered in less than five. So, I find 
		myself conflicted.

					GRADY
		Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in 
		the Hamptons.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(brightening)
		Grady.

	Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.

					Q 
		Hello.. .Professor.

					GRADY
		Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The 
		Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' 
		material for her.

	As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the 
	other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN 
	TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.

					MAN IN TWEED 
			(to short man)
		A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm 
		telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob 
		laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa? 
		Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot 
		bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
			(as GRADY passes) 
		Grady!

					GRADY
		Hello, Nathan.

					MAN IN TWEED
		My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The 
		PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for 
		you, Grady.
			(to his friend)
		GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,

	The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.

					SHORT MAN
		Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I 
		say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon 
		of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it 
		on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years 
		running.

					GRADY
			(pulling away) 
		No wonder it's still in print.

	As GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette.

					WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
		...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy 
		fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to 
		deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover 
		the cancer in your heart every time, but God 
		forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.

14	EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT   

	GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from 
	his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around 
	the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE 
	accosts him.

					MAN'S VOICE 
		There you are.

	GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he 
	sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the 
	person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in 
	the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.  

					WALTER
		I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in 
		here. You haven't seen it, have you?

					SARA
		I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if 
		I was sitting on it.

					WALTER
		You'd recognize it if you tasted it.

					SARA
		I doubt it, darling.

					WALTER
			(angling & bottle to the light)
		Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he 
		will be addressing 500 people in little over an 
		hour...

					SARA
		You want to keep him happy.

					WALTER 
		If he' s happy. . .
			(kissing her as he exits) 
		I'm happy.

	As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in 
	the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, 
	she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, 
	returning to the clamor inside her house.

	GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of 
	LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching 
	him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's 
	garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught 
	eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the 
	porch.

					GRADY
		James?

	James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a 
	GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at 
	what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's fake.

	James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY 
	peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The 
	sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED 
	PISTOL.

					JAMES LEER
		It was my mother's. She won it in a penny 
		arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic 
		school.

					GRADY
		It's very convincing.

					JAMES LEER
		It used to shoot these little paper caps, but 
		they don't make them anymore. The caps.

	GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers 
	and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.

					JAMES LEER
		It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry 
		rabbits' feet...

					GRADY
		...You carry firearms.

	As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass 
	briefly over the jay. GRADY
	notices, offers.

					JAMES LEER
		No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of 
		my emotions.

	GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were 
		wondering. I crashed. I mean, not 
		intentionally...

	James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be 
	seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		...but the other night, Hannah and I were 
		together, at the movies, and she asked me. 
		Since she was coming. So I ended up coming. 
		Too.

	GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.

					GRADY
		Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?

					JAMES LEER 
		No! What gave you that idea?

					GRADY
		Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent 
		her a room.

					JAMES LEER
		She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
			(glancing back at the window) 
		Besides, she doesn't really know me. She 
		thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's 
		because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.

					GRADY
		Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she 
		knows it and try as she might to not let that 
		screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in 
		some way.

	James looks away from the window, at Grady.

					JAMES LEER
		You're not like my other teachers, Professor 
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		You're not like my other students, James. So 
		what was the movie you two saw?

					JAMES LEER
		Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and 
		Frances Farmer.

					GRADY
		She went crazy, Frances Farmer.

					JAMES LEER
		So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.

					GRADY
		Sounds like a good one.

					JAMES LEER 
			(a crooked smile) 
		It's not bad.

	GRADY considers James' fragile face.

					GRADY
		Listen, James, about this afternoon. In 
		workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a 
		bit out of control.

					JAMES LEER
		They really hated it. I think they hated it 
		more than any of the other ones.

					GRADY
		Well...

					JAMES LEER
		It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to 
		write.

					GRADY
			(truly impressed) 
		Really? That's remarkable.

					JAMES LEER
		I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in 
		bed I figure them out. The stories.

	As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY 
	looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat. 
	Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against 
	the modest bulk of the cap gun.

					GRADY
		You cold, James?

					JAMES LEER 
			(distant) 
		A little.

					GRADY
		So what are you doing out here?

					JAMES LEER 
		It's colder in there. -

					GRADY
			(laughing) 
		You're right.

	James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that 
	he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse

					JAMES LEER
		Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought 
		...I thought I'd come out here and take a look 
		at it. You don't see one of those every day. It 
		looks like heaven...

					GRADY
		Heaven?

					JAMES LEER
		I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in 
		heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in 
		crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the 
		way I remember it...

	Abruptly, James glances at his watch.

					JAMES LEER 
		I should be going.

	James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a 
	moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		Goodbye, Professor Tripp.

	GRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off 
	then, leaving the light of the house behind.

					GRADY
		James. 
			(as he stops)
		Don't leave just yet. There's something I 
		think you ought to see.

					JAMES LEER 
		I'll miss my bus.

					GRADY
		This is worth it.

	James looks conflicted.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Trust me.

15	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER  

	It's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past 
	the departing guests and toward the stairs.        

					HANNAH GREEN
		Hey, you two.

	GRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.

					HANNAH GREEN (cont'd) 
		Are you riding with me, James?

					JAMES LEER 
		No, I'm going ho--

					GRADY
		He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his 
		friend. All right?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Ail right. By the way, his friend...?

					GRADY
		The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. 
		Where are they exactly?

					CRABTREE
		Here we are!

	CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss 
	Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry.

					CRABTREE
			(spying James) 
		Nell, hello there.

	CRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James 
	Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.

					GRADY
		James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

					HANNAH GREEN
		James'll know about George Sanders.

					JAMES LEER 
		George Sanders?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders 
		killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

					JAMES LEER
		Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel 
		room.

	The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but 
	Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.

					CRABTREE
		How comprehensive of you.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie 
		suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.

					JAMES LEER 
		There's so many...

					HANNAH GREEN
		Just a few then. The big ones.

	James glances at the loose group of people around him, 
	watching, then...

					JAMES LEER
		Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles 
		Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 
		1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an 
		accident, but, you know. . . 
			(a trace of irony)
		He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took 
		pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he 
		hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in 
		lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more 
		pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget 
		when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot 
		himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. 
		Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret 
		Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. 
		Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 
		1978. There are more but I don't know if you 
		would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara 
		Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I haven't heard of half of those.

					CRABTREE
		You did them alphabetically.

	James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James 
	blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs 
	shyly, looks away.

					JAMES LEER
		That's just how my brain works, I guess.

					CRABTREE
		Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out 
		with us after the lecture. There's a place on 
		the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

					JAMES LEER
		Actually. ..I just want to go home.

					CRABTREE
		Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants 
		to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. 
		Just think of it as a field trip.

	As he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if 
	to say: "Bring him."   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James 
	glacially as we CUT TO:

	BLACK

	The dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR 
	opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of 
	MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.

16	INT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE   

	GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the 
	photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
	STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN 
	JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.

					JAMES LEER 
		Is that really it?

					GRADY
		That's really it.

					JAMES LEER
		The one she wore on her wedding day?

					GRADY
		So I'm told.

	James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide 
	garments, stands speechless.

					GRADY
			(cont'd) 
		Go ahead.

					JAMES LEER 
		Really?

					GRADY
		Really.

	James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he 
	reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, 
	barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.

					JAMES LEER
		They're glass. The buttons.

					GRADY
		Like the lady herself.

	GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a 
	bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the 
	jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.

					JAMES LEER
		She was small. Most people don't know that. 
		The shoulders are small.
			(touching the satin)
		It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time 
		she wore it. That day. She must've felt so 
		...happy.

	GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, 
	lifts it lightly.

					JAMES LEER
		It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... 
		something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

					GRADY
		I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth 
		about how much he pays for these things.

					JAMES LEER
		You're really good friends with the 
		Chancellor, aren't you?

	Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains 
	unchanged, consumed with the jacket.

					GRADY
			(carefully)
		Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, 
		too.

					JAMES LEER
		I guess you must be, if you know the 
		combination to his closet and he doesn't mind 
		your being here in their bedroom like this.

					GRADY
		Right.

	A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The 
	CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom 
	window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN 
	DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.

					GRADY
		We, better skedaddle. Close that closet-- 
		James? You ail right?

	James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed, 
	knapsack between his knees, head in hands.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing 
		that jacket that belonged to her. It just 
		looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a 
		closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.

					GRADY
		Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself 
		tonight.

					JAMES LEER 
		You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail? 
			(off Grady's look)
		Hannah mentioned something about it.   About a 
		note.

					GRADY
		Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we 
		should go now.

	Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light, 
	leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.

	James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.

17	INT. HALLWAY

	A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY
	as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to 
	the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in 
	Grady's direction.

					GRADY
		Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .

	GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward 
	and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.

					GRADY
		Jesus!

	GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the 
	ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his 
	head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.

					GRADY
		Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!

	Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his 
	head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, 
	growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his 
	throat, until there is a sharp...

	CRACK! CRACK!

	Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily 
	onto Grady's legs. GRADY
	turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the 
	little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.

	GRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.

					GRADY
		Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.

					JAMES LEER 
		I had to. Didn't I?

					GRADY
		Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?

					JAMES LEER
		No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1 
		thought --

					GRADY
		Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on 
		me.

	GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through 
	life with a slight overbite.

					JAMES LEER
		Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see 
		if someone's breathing.

					GRADY
		He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead 
		dog when I see one.

	James looks miserably at Poe.

					JAMES LEER
		What are we going to do?

	GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.

					GRADY
		First you're going to give me that little cap 
		gun of yours.

18	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING 

	GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield.

					JAMES LEER
		Professor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question?

					GRADY
		Yea, James.

					JAMES LEER 
		What are we going to do with...

	James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange 
	blue eyes gleaming.

					GRADY
		I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out 
		how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her 
		husband's dog.

					JAMES LEER
		You?

					GRADY
		Trust me, James, when the family pet's been 
		assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear 
		one of her students was the triggerman.

					JAMES LEER
		Does she want to hear it was one of her 
		professors?

					GRADY
		I've got tenure.

19	EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) 

	As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of 
	Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a 
	space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.

					GRADY
		Okay.

	James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs 
	looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps 
	forward, and takes the hind legs.

					JAMES LEER
		He's still a little warm.

	They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until 
	there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.

					JAMES LEER 
		Yuck.

	GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.

					JAMES LEER 
		That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a 
		suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost 
		perfectly.

					GRADY
			(searching)
		That's just what they used to say in the ads. 
		Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...

					JAMES LEER
		Whose tuba is that anyway? 

					GRADY
		Miss Sloviak's.

					JAMES LEER
		Can I ask you something about her?

					GRADY
		She is. Ah. Here we go...

	GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-
	size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of 
	boxers.

					JAMES LEER
		Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
		gay?

					GRADY
		Most of the time he is, James. Some of the 
		time he isn't. Now what do we have here?

	GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a 
	pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.

					GRADY
		Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That 
		should take the pinch out of my ankle.
			(handing the bottle to James) 
		Have one.

					JAMES LEER
		No thanks. I'm fine without them.

					GRADY
		Right. That's why you were standing in the 
		Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap 
		gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right, 
		you're fit as a fucking fiddle.

	GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, 
	drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.

					GRADY
		I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.

	Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, 
	and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, 
	he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill 
	from the lapel of his jacket.

					GRADY
		How 'bout we try that again.

20	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

	On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.

					WALTER
		...really needs no introduction. Walk down the 
		aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any 
		hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at 
		you. You all know the name, you all know the 
		books, so welcome if you will, the man those of 
		us who know him simply call.. .Q.

	As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the 
	auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an 
	open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID 
	with a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
 
					Q 
		Good evening.

	GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, 
	watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting 
	until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory 
	hush. Finally, he speaks again.

					Q 
		I am a writer.

	As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He 
	glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a 
	similar look of bafflement.

					Q (cont'd)
		As a writer, one thing you learn is that 
		everyone you encounter has a story. Every 
		bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an 
		idea or a. story that would make a "great book" 
		or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has 
		an idea. (gestures to the audience)
		But, how do you go from there to here? How do 
		you go from having an idea to having a book? 
		How do you get across? What is the bridge, the 
		bridge that allows you to walk on air from the 
		shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of 
		accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is 
		worth the telling, faith that you have the 
		wherewithal to tell it, faith that the 
		carefully woven structure you create won't 
		collapse beneath you...

	GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking 
	and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far 
	EXIT. A blink later, she is gone.

					Q (cont'd)
		...and faith that when you get to the other 
		side someone will be waiting who gives a damn 
		about the tale you have to tell.

	GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own 
	HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a 
	thread forty feet above his head...

	Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: 
	bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the 
	auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, 
	James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows 
	away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.

	GRADY blinks, turns to James.

					GRADY
		I'll be right back.

21	INT. LOBBY

	GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the 
	lobby. A PAIR. of local BOOKSELLERS, chatting quietly 
	behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors, 
	glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms. 

22	INT. CORRIDOR  

	GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor 
	begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his 
	cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes....

	BLACK FOR A 

	MOMENT AND THEN....

					SARA'S VOICE 
		Grady? Grady?

	GRADY opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above 
	him. He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy 
	blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.

					SARA
		You had another one, didn't you? You have to 
		see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday 
		morning. All right?

					GRADY
		Is the thing-is it over?

					SARA 
		Almost. Wane to sit up?
			(as he winces) 
		What's the matter?

					GRADY
		Nothing. I think I twisted my--

	GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.

					GRADY
		I have to tell you something. Something.. 
		.hard.

	Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.

					SARA
		Then stand up. I'm too old for all this 
		roiling around on the floor.

	GRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a 
	cigarette.

					GRADY
		Well...

					SARA
		Don't. I know what you're going to say.

					GRADY
		No, really, Sara, I don't think you--

					SARA
		You love Emily. I know that. And you need to 
		stay with her.

					GRADY
		I don't think I really have a choice in, that. 
		Emily left me.

					SARA
		She'll come back. That's why I'm going to. 
		..to not have this baby.

	GRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette 
	to her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the 
	floor.

					GRADY
		Not have it.

					SARA
		No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think 
		there's no way?

					GRADY
		Well, no, I don't see any way.
			(taking her hand)
		And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose 
		this chance.

					SARA
			(jerking away)
		No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. 
		And fuck you for "saying. . .
			(quietly)
		...for saying there's just no way. Because 
		there could be a way, Grady.

	Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.

					SARA
			(composing herself)
		He must be finishing. We should go.

	GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his 
	coat.  As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS 
	to the floor.

					SARA
		Who's gun is that?

					GRADY
		It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

	Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.

					SARA
		Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.

					GRADY
		Caps.

	She points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.

					SARA 
		Pow.

					GRADY
		You got me.

					SARA
		I love you, Grady.

	GRADY places his fingers gently over Sara's... and 
	removes the gun from her hand.

					GRADY
		I love you, too.

23	INT. LOBBY 

	The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges, 
	arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT.

					JAMES LEER
		Woah! The doors made so much noise!

	As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.

					JAMES LEER
		This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry 
		me out.

					GRADY
		Is he ail right?

					CRABTREE
			(rolling his eyes) 
		He's fine. He's narrating.

					JAMES LEER 
		We're going to the men's room. Only we might 
		not make it in time.

					SARA
		Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you 
		to make that mistake, wait here.

	As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the 
	lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		I need a ride.

					GRADY
		I'm your man.

24	EXT. STREET 24

	As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK 
	stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase.

					GRADY
		There's an explanation.

	MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, 
	unzips her suitcase.

25	INT.    GRADY'S CAR - MOVING   

	As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top 
	button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered 
	COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the 
	glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL 
	POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the 
		poor thing?

					GRADY
		James is. ..I don't know...

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets 
		done with him, he's going to be even more 
		disturbed.

					GRADY
		I'm not sure that's possible.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Sure it is.

	GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her 
	forehead.

					GRADY
		Listen, Antonia--

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Tony. Now that I'm home.

					GRADY
		Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so 
		well for you tonight. With Terry.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Forget it. I should've known better. Your 
		friend is just, I don't know, into collecting 
		weird tricks. Mind?

	Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.

					GRADY
		He's writing his name in water.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		What's that?

					GRADY
		Like most editors, he really wants to be a 
		writer, but he's too busy living a novel to 
		bother writing one.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a 
		shit.

					GRADY
		He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the 
		feeling he's going through the motions a bit.

	Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		You mean because his career's ruined and all?

					GRADY
		Jesus. Is that what he told you?

					MISS SLOVIAK
		He said he hasn't had a success in ten years 
		and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of 
		.a. . .

	As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse 
	of his own swollen eyes.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good 
		that he'll be able to keep his job.

	Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points.

					MISS SLOVIAK
			(cont'd) 
		Turn here.

26	EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE

	GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front 
	lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a 
	little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.

					GRADY
		That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese 
		beetle trap.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.

	The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN 
	squints through the screen door.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		There's Pop. 
			(turning)
		Let me see it. The gun.

	GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony 
	smirks.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Figures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis 
		would carry. In a little beaded purse?

	GRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the 
	front screen door. Pop is still there.

					GRADY
		I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue 
		James Leer.

	MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and 
	peers in at Grady.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think 
		about going home. You look like you need a 
		little rescuing yourself.

27	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB 

	GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS 
	stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron 
	in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then 
	slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.

27A	EXT. ENTRANCE - HI-HAT CLUB     

	As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a 
	perfunctory pat-down.

					BOUNCER 
			(kidding him) 
		Clean tonight, hub, Professor?

					GRADY
		As a whistle.

28	INT. HI-HAT CLUB

	Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY 
	enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons 
	with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her 
	glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated 
	shrug and she points.

	CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James 
	slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the 
	general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath 
	the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap.

	Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing 
	WAITRESS.

					GRADY
		Double Dickel on the rocks.

29	INT. BOOTH 

	As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately 
	and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.

					GRADY
		Is that just beer?

					CRABTREE
		Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a 
		little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You 
		missed a few bottles, by the way.

					GRADY
		I'm sure. Where is everyone?

					CRABTREE
		Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to 
		go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

	GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's 
	copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts 
	back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.

					GRADY
		Jesus. He's out.

	CRABTREE glances over, nods.

					CRABTREE
		He has a book.

					GRADY
		I know. He started it Fall semester.

					CRABTREE
		He finished it Winter Break.

	GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise.  He 
	glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall.

					CRABTREE
		So. Is he any good?

					GRADY
		No. Not yet he isn't.

					CRABTREE
		Well, I'm going to read it anyway.

					GRADY
		Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one o£ 
		my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure 
		if he's-

					CRABTREE
		He is. Take my word for it.

					GRADY
		I think it's more complicated than that. 
		Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost 
		...did something stupid tonight. At least, I 
		think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual 
		confusion thrown into the stew right now.

					CRABTREE
		On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.

					WAITRESS 
			(ducking in) 
		Double Dickel.

					GRADY
		Thanks.

	GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes 
	she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear 
	beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah 
	Green's slinky form seizes his attention.

					CRABTREE
		No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?

					GRADY
		Shut up and drink.

	CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.

					CRABTREE
		Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?

	GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but 
	it's not Oola CRABTREE
	is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.

					GRADY 
		President of the James Brown Hair Club For 
		Men.

	Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with 
	big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most 
	noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.

					GRADY
			(initiating an old game) 
		He's a boxer. A flyweight.

					CRABTREE
		Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis.. 
		.Curtis Hardapple.

					GRADY
		Not Curtis.

					CRABTREE
		Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are 
		from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and 
		got trampled.

					GRADY
		And now he's addicted to painkillers.

					CRABTREE
		He can't piss standing up anymore.

					GRADY
		He lives with his mother.

					CRABTREE
		And he had a younger brother who . . .was . . 
		. a. . .

					GRADY
		Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames 
		Vernon for his death.

					CRABTREE
			(stumped)
		Because. . .because. . .

					JAMES LEER 
			(sleepily)
		.. .he was killed, when a gangster named 
		Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite 
		horse. He took the bullet himself.

	GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens 
	one bloodshot eye to regard them.

					JAMES LEER
		Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.

	James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.

					CRABTREE
		That was good.

					GRADY
		He heard everything we were saying.

	Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me.

30	INT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          30

	GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the 
	jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a 
	sexy, measured blues.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's 
		so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail 
		your sentences always existed, just waiting 
		around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to 
		fetch them down.

					GRADY
		I thank you.

					HANNAH GREEN
		And I love the inscription you wrote to me. 
		Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think 
		I am.

					GRADY
		I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy 
		innocents we can get.

	GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say 
	something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair 
	from James Leer's forehead.

					HANNAH GREEN
		So what are you going to do?

					GRADY
		Do?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to 
		be there when you get home.

	GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then 
	catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The 
	tile that would reflect his head is missing.

					GRADY
		Are you holding me up or am I dragging you 
		down?

	Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Shush.

31	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM)       

	Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to 
	Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.

					GRADY
		Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make 
		sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I would if I knew where I was taking him.

					GRADY
		Hannah, are you telling me you don't know 
		where James Leer lives?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen 
		it.

					GRADY
		That strikes me as odd.

					HANNAH GREEN
		James is odd. I know he has an aunt in 
		Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, 
		but... 
			(remembering)
		Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's 
		house. He said she worked there. Or something. 
		I don't remember.

	James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car.

					JAMES LEER 
		Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....

					GRADY
		What's he saying?

					HANNAH GREEN
		His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's 
		always carrying around. He must've left it 
		inside.

					GRADY
		Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...

	GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. 
	CRABTREE
	and Q huddle inside.

					GRADY
		Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the 
		auditorium.

					JAMES LEER
			(delirious, but insistent) 
		Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!

	GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		All right. Take him to my place. He can crash 
		on the sofa.

					HANNAH GREEN
		The one in your office? It's the best one .for 
		naps.

					GRADY
		I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We 
		could probably stand him up in the garage with 
		the snow shovels at this point.

	As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls 
	into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.

					GRADY
		Ail right. In my office.

	As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his 
	face.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.

	GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and 
	drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has 
	his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.

	Vernon Hardapple.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		You driving this car?

					GRADY
		Excuse me?

					VERNON HARDAPPLE
		This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving 
		this car?

					GRADY
		It's mine.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.

					GRADY
		You must be mistaken.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		Bullshit.

	GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.

					GRADY
		Go home to your mother, Vernon.

32	INT. GALAXIE      

	GRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and 
	starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees 
	CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.

					GRADY

		All right, what's the matter?

	CRABTREE just keeps smiling.

					GRADY
		Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? 
		The kid's practically in a coma.

					CRABTREE
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		Yes.

					CRABTREE
		Hit your brakes.

	GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a 
	SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break 
	pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield.

					Q 
			(squinting)
		Oh my God! What is that?

	It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the 
	beams of light.

					GRADY
		What's this guy's problem?

					CRABTREE
		Just go around him.

	GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances 
	back in front of Grady's grille.

					GRADY
		Shit.

					CRABTREE
		Back up. Go out the other way.

	GRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then 
	turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind 
	the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches 
	in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high 
	wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.

	As GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.

					GRADY
		Now what?

					Q
			(mischievously)
		You could always go over him.

	Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his 
	heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto 
	the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides 
	smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the 
	night.

					Q 
		What just happened?

	GRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.

					GRADY
		I just had my car jumped on.

33	EXT. THAW HAIL - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER) 

	Grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out.

					GRADY
		Wait here. I'll be right back.

					CRABTREE
		Where would we go?

34	INT. LOBBY   

	The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging 
	the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky 
	FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps 
	his hand against the glass.

					JANITOR 
		It's open.

	GRADY pushes on the door and it opens.

					JANITOR (cont'd) 
		Hey, Professor Tripp. 
			(off Grady's look)
		Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year. 
		Then I dropped out of school.

					GRADY
		I hope it wasn't my fault.

					TRAXLER
			(taking him seriously)
		No. I guess you're here for the backpack. 

					GRADY
		Oh.. .yeah.

35	INT. AUDITORIUM       

	The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding 
	chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.


					TRAXLER
		I saw the manuscript inside. So when you 
		showed up, I figured. . .

	GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title 
	page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and 
	then, halfway down, TEXT.

					TRAXLER 
		Is it good?

					GRADY
			(reading)
		I don't know. It might be...

36     CUT

37	EXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER 

	GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and, 
	hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops.

	Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone. 

38	INT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT   

	Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the 
	original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The 
	backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.

					TRAXLER
		Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true 
		about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on 
		his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last 
		longer?

					GRADY
		Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?

					TRAXLER 
		Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, 
		aren't you?

	Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on 
	the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S 
	PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch.

					GRADY
		Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub 
		ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground 
		lamb.

					TRAXLER 
		Sick.

39	EXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

	Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street 
	from the Gaskell's house.

					TRAXLER
		Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your 
		wife?

	GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse.

					GRADY
		No, my wife's out of town.

	Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom, 
	then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway. 
	Walter appears on the front steps.

					TRAXLER (cont'd) 
		Who's that guy?

					GRADY
		Her husband.

	Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.

					TRAXLER
		What exactly are we doing here, Professor 
		Tripp?

					GRADY
			(staring at Sara) 
		Taking the long way home.

39A	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER

	As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James 
	Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above 
	the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with 
	only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He 
	takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.

40	INT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE

	GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.

41	INT. LIVING ROOM     

	The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes 
	of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he 
	finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-
	shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling 
	hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet 
	Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but 
	his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He 
	steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his 
	disappointment--only the red cowboy boots.

	He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.

42	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

	James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old 
	sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James' 
	knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects 
	his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.

	Something yellow. Something soft.

	GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing 
	a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET 
	from James Leer's ratty green knapsack. 

	GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking 
	very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the 
	light on the both of them.

43	EXT. FRONT PORCH - SATURDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY) 

	GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and 
	plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch 
	step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it, 
	then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.

44	INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER     

	As CRABTREE SNORES thunderously, GRADY eases open the 
	door, spots the CAR KEYS on the dresser, grabs them.

44A	INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS

	GRADY eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops, 
	his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from 
	Crabtree's room.

44B	INT. EMILY'S OFFICE 

	GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, 
	lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and 
	well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of 
	Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, 
	pads and pens neatly arranged alongside.

	A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate 
	mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS, 
	framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's 
	DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's 
	Daughter.

	There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck 
	with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing 
	Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR of 
	YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan.

	Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.

45	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

	GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the 
	sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.

					JAMES LEER 
			(without waking) 
		Thank you.

					GRADY
		You're welcome.

	GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee 
	from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center 
	of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a 
	clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual 
	precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP 
	that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.

	All net.

	A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without 
	further ceremony, GRADY
	turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC 
	and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:

		(beat) 2611

	In other words: Page 2611.

	CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS, 
	the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that 
	grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.

					GRADY
		James I  

	GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's 
	quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.

					GRADY
		I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

					JAMES LEER 
		I put you on the floor.

					GRADY
		Oh.

					JAMES LEER
		I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow 
		your tongue or something.
			(nodding to Grady's robe)
		I guess you really miss her, huh?

	GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets 
	of the robe, its overall fuzziness.

					GRADY
		Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write 
		in it.

					JAMES LEER
		I guess there's probably a story behind that.

					GRADY
		There is, but it's not that interesting.

	James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the 
	TELEPHONE RINGS.

					JAMES LEER 
		Want me to get that?

					GRADY
		Sure.

	As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises 
	delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to 
	see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.

					JAMES LEER 
			(returning)
		He didn't give his name.

					GRADY
		Who?

					JAMES LEER 
		The guy on the phone.

					GRADY
		What'd he say?

					JAMES LEER
		He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here 
		and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 
		with black interior.

					GRADY
		What'd you tell him?

					JAMES LEER
		Yes.

					GRADY
		Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be 
		sure to mention the back door pops open with a 
		couple hard shakes to the right.

					JAMES LEER
		I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or 
		something. Is that single-spaced?

	James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on 
	Grady's desk.

					GRADY
		Afraid so.

					JAMES LEER
		That's a big book you're writing.

					GRADY
		I think it's sort of writing itself at this 
		point.

					JAMES LEER
		Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, 
		but--

					GRADY
		But . . . ?

					JAMES LEER
		Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been 
		awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some 
		people--some of the kids in workshop--thought 
		maybe you were...

					GRADY
		Washed up?

					JAMES LEER 
		Blocked.

					GRADY
		Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.

	James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.

					JAMES LEER
		No kidding.

	A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch 
	Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, 
	materialize in the hallway.

					CRABTREE
		Good morning, boys. James.

	James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.

					GRADY
			(re: James' "attire") 
		If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, 
		I'd put on something a little less comfortable 
		if I were you.

	As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the 
	page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare 
	into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE 
	seems to have made him suddenly queasy.

					JAMES LEER 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Hm.

					JAMES LEER 
		How did I get here last night?

					GRADY
		No one seems to know where you live, James. 
		Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

					JAMES LEER
		And ...and before that. Did I do anything? 
		Anything bad?

					GRADY
		Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the 
		English Department's dog and steal his most 
		prized piece of memorabilia.

	As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY 
	looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now 
	parked at the bottom of his driveway.

					GRADY
		Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.

46	EXT. FRONT PORCH

	A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the 
	door opens, GRADY
	appears.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		Good morning... 
			(eyeing Grady's robe)
		Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but 
		I understand you attended an event at Sara and 
		Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one 
		of the last to leave...

47	INT. LANDING - SAME TIME                                  47

	James lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the 
	sleeping bag, straining to hear.

					OFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)
		...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. 
		Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of 
		place. Suspicious maybe...

48	EXT. FRONT PORCH 

	GRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought.

					GRADY
		Well, there's always people you don't know at 
		these things, but I can't say there was anybody 
		particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one 
		guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		A jockey? You mean, like--

					GRADY
		Horses, right. Vernon something...
			(thinking... )
		Hardpple

	Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		Hardapple?

					GRADY
		I could be wrong. What happened anyway?

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's 
		closet. And the dog's missing.

					GRADY
		That's weird.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's 
		blind and we figure he just wandered off and 
		got run over.

					GRADY
		The perpetrator.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		No, the dog.

					GRADY
		Just kidding.

	Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing 
	With Assholes."

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		One other thing. About this kid, this student 
		of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know 
		how I could get in touch with him, would you?

					GRADY
		I might have his number on campus.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		That's all right. We'll find him.

	Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and 
	turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...

					HANNAH GREEN (O.S.) 
		There you are...

	GRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across 
	the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy-
	eyed and delectable.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I thought we were going to talk. Last night.

					GRADY
		Oh. Well. I...

	Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up 
	her thighs.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.

	GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes 
	through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is 
	heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down 
	the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik 
	drive away in his big police car.

					JAMES LEER 
		What do we do now?

#####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him 
#####RINGS.

					GRADY
		Hello?

					SARA'S VOICE
		Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You 
		won't believe what's happened.

					GRADY
		Could you hold on a minute, honey?

	With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever-
	so- gently ...hang up the phone.

					GRADY
		How 'bout we get the hell out of here?

49	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 

	James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath 
	his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack 
	swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of 
	KEYS.

					GRADY
		You start her up.

	As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice 
	blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the 
	keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides 
	behind the steering wheel.

					JAMES LEER
			(as the engine roars) 
		How's that?

					GRADY
		Well done, James.

	As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the 
	wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Shit!

	James blinks, pokes his head out the window.

					JAMES LEER
		You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.

50	INT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)   

	GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a 
	neighborhood MARKET. GRADY
	has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering 
	his ragged thumb.

					GRADY
		Where exactly do you live, James?

	James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of 
	ORANGE JUICE, stops.

					GRADY
		Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as 
		to the location of your apartment.

	GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic 
	hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.

					JAMES LEER
		I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked 
		out. I was asked to leave.

					GRADY
		I guess there's probably a story behind that.

					JAMES LEER
		There is, but it's not that interesting.

					GRADY
		So where have you been staying?

					JAMES LEER 
			(a long pause) 
		The bus station.

	GRADY stares incredulously at James.

					JAMES LEER
		It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor. 
		And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.

					GRADY
			(trying to fathom this) 
		But James. I mean. ..How long?

					JAMES LEER
		A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had 
		the gun. For protection.

					GRADY
		Jesus, James, you should've told someone.

					JAMES LEER 
		Who?

					GRADY
		I don't know...
			(unconvincingly)
		Me.

	GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, 
	abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling 
	on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is 
	staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST 
	PAPERBACK. GRADY
	frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a 
	spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.

	A thought evolves.

					GRADY (cont'd)
			(the balloons)
		What do you think of these?

	James takes another chug from his jug, nods.

					JAMES LEER 
		Nice.

51	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING 

	Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared 
	ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in 
	front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.

52	INT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS  

	GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches 
	something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James 
	glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the 
	glovebox, then peers at the house.

					JAMES LEER 
			(the house) 
		Isn't this...?

					GRADY
		Hm.

	GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange 
	juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.

					GRADY
		You better ease off that stuff, James. It's 
		pretty acidic.

	James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, 
	studies it curiously.

					JAMES LEER
		I can't help myself. I don't know what's the 
		matter with me.

					GRADY
		Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you 
		think's the matter with you?

	As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers 
	the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets 
	the donut in precisely the same place.

53	INT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER

	Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the 
	balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the 
	balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.

					SARA O.S.) 
		Feeling guilty?

	GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized 
	behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.

					GRADY
		Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this 
		morning. Can you talk?

	Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.

					SARA
		Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for 
		WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole 
		Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, 
		too.

					GRADY
		I-heard.

					SARA 
		You heard? How?

					GRADY
		A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house 
		this morning.

					SARA 
		Did you confess?

	GRADY looks up, mildly alarmed.

					SARA
		Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

					GRADY 
		Really? That was fast.

					SARA 
			(frowning)
		I'm kidding. Hello?

					GRADY
		Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There 
		is something I need to tell...

					SARA
		Are you limping? Why are you limping?

					GRADY
		Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to . 
		. .

					SARA
		Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall 
		somewhere?

					GRADY
		No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I 
		don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell 
		you something.

					SARA 
		All right.

	Sara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting.

					GRADY
		I...

	As GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
		 ...want to be with you.

	Sara looks at him.

					SARA
		Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I 
		don't know whether to swoon or smirk.

					GRADY
		Really, Sara, I...

	Sara holds up one gloved hand.

					SARA
		I believe you. I believe you want to be with 
		me. But this is not just about me anymore.

					GRADY
		I know that. I know what's at stake here...

					SARA
		No, I don't think you do. And besides... I 
		haven't decided yet.

					GRADY
		About the baby.

					SARA 
		That ...and you.

	GRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop 
	them on  a table.

					SARA
		I'm not going to draw the map for you on this 
		one, Grady. Times like these you have to do 
		your own navigating.

	Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the 
	street.

					SARA
		Who's that sitting in your car?

					GRADY
		James Leer.

					SARA 
		What's he doing out there?

					GRADY
		I'm sort of helping him work through some 
		issues.

	Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.

					SARA 
		Isn't he lucky.

	GRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the 
	house, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers 
	a limp hand in return, but it's too late.

	She's already gone.

54	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - LATER 54

	GRADY cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw, while James 
	sits stiffly, the orange juice jug bobbing between his 
	thighs.

					JAMES LEER
		She seemed to take it pretty well.

					GRADY
		Yeah, well, actually. . .

	James looks over.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		The moment didn't really present itself.

	James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window, 
	staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. GRADY 
	glances at him. At the orange juice jug.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		You' re not planning on puking in my car, are 
		you, James?

	Nothing.

					GRADY
		Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley 
		Heights. We could find you a nice golf course 
		to barf on.

					JAMES LEER 
			(sharply) 
		No.

	GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James 
	blinks, looks embarrassed.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...

	James peers out the window at passing landscape.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		I've got a thing about, ..places like this. I 
		know what those houses are like. I know what 
		the people are like.

					GRADY
		Your aunt ?

	James turns, eyes flashing with surprise.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Hannah mentioned something about an aunt.

	James nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes 
	a JOINT between his fingers, sniffs it.

					JAMES LEER 
		Humboldt County?

					GRADY
			(surprised)
		Maybe...

					JAMES LEER
		It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.

					GRADY
		Glaucoma?

					JAMES LEER 
		Colon cancer.

					GRADY
		Jesus, James. Wow.

	James puts the joint back in the ashtray.

					JAMES' LEER
		It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a 
		small town.

					GRADY
		Where's that?

					JAMES LEER
		Carvel.

					GRADY
		Carvel? Where's Carvel?

					JAMES LEER 
		Outside Scranton.

					GRADY
		I never heard of it.

					JAMES LEER
		It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin 
		factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five 
		years.

					GRADY
		Your father worked in a mannequin factory?

					JAMES LEER
		Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn. 
		She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before 
		that, she'd been a dancer.

					GRADY
		What kind of dancer? .

					JAMES LEER
		Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

					GRADY 
			(in disbelief)
		James Leer, are you telling me your mother was 
		a stripper?

					JAMES LEER
		I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. 
		And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's 
		clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a 
		bad debt.

					GRADY
		Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic 
		school?

					JAMES LEER 
		When we fall, we fall hard.

					GRADY
		Amazing.

	GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then 
	notices-with surprise--James has his hand out.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		I thought you were the guy who didn't like to 
		lose control of his emotions.

					JAMES LEER
		Maybe I just needed the moment to present 
		itself.

55	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER)

	GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a 
	modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the 
	JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.

					JAMES LEER
		This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy 
		would live. What's it called again?

					GRADY
		Kinship.

					JAMES LEER
		Kinship. And what's here?

					GRADY
		Unless I miss my bet...my wife.

	James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.

					JAMES LEER 
		The one that left you?

					GRADY
		That's right. That one.

56	EXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE

	GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against 
	the glass of the living room window, squints inside. 
	Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the 
	hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's 
	sitting in the indentation.


					JAMES LEER
		Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-

					GRADY
		How can you tell?

					JAMES LEER
		You can see the outline of a butt.

	As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.

					GRADY
		Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you 
		can start on the box.

58	EXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER)

	As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows.

					JAMES LEER
		Maybe she didn't come here.

					GRADY
		She came here. We'll just wait. In the 
		meantime, I need you to shimmy through.

	James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch 
	door.

					GRADY
		Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since 
		she was twelve years old. And your hips are as 
		slim as hers.

					JAMES LEER
		It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you 
		know-of what's in the car. In the trunk.

					GRADY
			(a pang of guilt himself)
		Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about 
		that.

	James takes another sad glance at the little door, then 
	drops onto ail fours.

59	INT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER     

	GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it 
	speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that 
	people will gather together, light a fire, talk.

					JAMES LEER 
		It feels really... good. ..here.

					GRADY
		I know. It's the house you want to wake up in 
		on Christmas morning.
			(moving off)
		Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

60	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 60

	Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a 
	DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of 
	quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels 
	of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a 
	PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.

	One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and 
	finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, 
	standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their 
	wedding day.

61	INT. DEN     

	James enters, FRENCH ROLL in hand, and sees a REMOTE 
	CONTROL atop the BAR. Taking it, he points it at the WIDE- 
	SCREEN TELEVISION imbedded in the opposite wall and, 
	seconds later, GEORGE SANDERS walks into his CLOSE-UP.

					GEORGE SANDERS
		There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr. 
		Gray. All influence is immoral...

62	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME  

	Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed 
	next to a huge TEDDY BEAR.

					GRADY
			(into phone)
		Yes, I' m looking for the Chancellor... I 
		don't know. She should be in the main hall 
		...Thank you.

63	INT. DEN     

	James runs through the channels, pauses on MARTIN MILNER 
	and GEORGE MAHARIS, riding in their curvy Corvette.

64	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME   

	A Nelson Riddle's THEME FROM ROUTE 66 BOOMS from below, 
	GRADY
	cups a hand over his ear.

					GRADY
		Sara? Hi. It's Grady.

					SARA'S VOICE
		Where are you, Grady? An elevator?

					GRADY
		I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some 
		things we need to talk about...

					SARA'S VOICE
			(evenly)
		You're in Kinship?

					GRADY
		Yes. But that's not why I called...

					SARA'S VOICE
		With Emily?

					GRADY
		What? No'. There's no one here. I'm just 
		...just....

					SARA'S VOICE
		Just what? Doing a little dusting?

	As GRADY endeavors to respond, TWO YOUTHFUL VOICES, 
	CHEERFULLY SINGING, rise from below.

					CHEERFUL VOICES       
		Good Morning! Good Morning!

					GRADY
			(yelling)
		James! For Christ sake, will you turn that 
		thing down!

					SARA'S VOICE
		James? He's still with you?

65	INT. DEN 

	James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of 
	Bushmills, smiles as JUDY GARLAND and MICKEY ROONEY sing 
	their hearts out in Babes In Arms.

					JUDY/MICKEY
		We talked the whole night through!

66	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 

	GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the 
	bedroom WINDOW.

					GRADY
		Look, Sara. ..I'm not here. ..I'm not here to 
		. . .

	As GRADY watches, a late-model PONTIAC BONNEVIlLE turns 
	into the driveway below him.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		 ...reconcile with Emily.

					SARA'S VOICE
		Are you there to not reconcile with her?

	The Bonneville's trunk pops open, revealing THREE BAGS OF 
	GROCERIES, and HANK and IRENE WINTERS, both in their 60's, 
	get out. An enormous NEWFOUNDLAND vaults from the backseat.

	Sara, eating phone static this whole time, interprets 
	Grady's silence her own way.

					SARA'S VOICE (cont'd) 
		Goodbye, Grady.

					GRADY
		No. Sara, you don't understand...

					SARA'S VOICE
		Trust me, I understand. I just want to say 
		something to you, Grady.

					GRADY
			(dreading it) 
		Yea?

					SARA'S VOICE
		How you choose to live your own life is your 
		business. But you be careful with that boy, 
		Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.

	As the line goes dead, GRADY watches Hank and Irene 
	Winters disappear below him.

69	INT. DEN       69

	James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt 
	County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy 
	and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation. Then, sensing 
	something ...he turns.

	Hank and Irene Winters, grocery bags in arm, stand 
	frozen.

					JAMES LEER     
		Hullo.

	FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the staircase and GRADY hobbies 
	into view. He tries a smile.

					GRADY
		Mom. Dad.

70	INT. DEN - WINTERS HOUSE - (A BIT LATER) 

	Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of 
	tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool.

					HANK
		Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm 
		just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you 
		to-find someone who knows what they're doing. 
		Here. Put your foot up.

	GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a 
	BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back 
	cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look 
	consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author 
	is himself.

					HANK
		So he's one of your students, this boy?

	GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene 
	sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James 
	is looking out the window, a curious expression on his 
	face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland 
	sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances 
	back into the living room, he and James make brief eye 
	contact, then blink, look away.

					GRADY
		Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed 
		up.

					HANK
		Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll 
		be fine.

	GRADY tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with 
	him?--but Hank gives nothing away. GRADY nods to the book.

					GRADY
		What made you pull out that old thing?

					HANK
			(shrugging)
		I was thinking of you.

					GRADY
		And?

					HANK
		It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you 
		know that. It's a young man's book. It got me 
		remembering how it felt to be young.

					GRADY
		Maybe I should read it.

					HANK
		Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you 
		aging prematurely, Grady.

	GRADY doesn't have to read Hank's face this time.

					GRADY
		Where's Emily, Hank?

					HANK
		I 'don't know if she'd want me  to tell you 
		that, Grady.

					GRADY
		I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just. 
		..want to know where I stand.

	Hank looks up, incredulous.

					HANK
		Where you stand?

					GRADY
			(embarrassed)
		l-just want to say I'm sorry.

					HANK
		She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The 
		neurologist.

					GRADY
		Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?

					HANK
			(frowning)
		Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley 
		together.

					GRADY
			(sheepishly)
		Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot 
		of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I 
		have the book to finish and--

					HANK
		Ah, right. The book.

	GRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something 
	in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks 
	away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James 
	again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I 
		didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want 
		you to know that.

					HANK
		Why did you come here, Grady?

	GRADY gestures vaguely.

					GRADY
		I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily. 
		And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let 
		everyone know that, even though it may be 
		difficult to comprehend now, this-everything 
		that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't 
		mean "Goodbye."

					HANK
		Give me a break, Grady.

	Hank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle.

					HANK
		You're done.

71	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - DUSK   71

	GRADY glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up 
	against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting 
	out any heat.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm having a really good time, Professor 
		Tripp.

	GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc.

					GRADY
		I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a 
		favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's 
		not for amateurs.

	James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat 
	LEVER.

					JAMES LEER 
		I just wanted a little sip.

					GRADY
			(squinting at him)
		I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, 
		exactly what point was it that you turned into 
		Serpent Boy?

					JAMES LEER
		Probably about the time you gave me the 
		codeine pills last night.

	GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose 
	face bears not the slightest trace of irony.

					GRADY
		Jesus... 
			(thinking, then. . . )
		Look, James, you appear to possess-like many 
		an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a 
		rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which 
		dreams are made. However, I 'think it's best 
		if, for the moment at least
			(taking the Ziploc)
			...we abstain.

					JAMES LEER 
		You're mad at me, aren't you?

					GRADY
		What?

					JAMES LEER
		You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's 
		dog.

					GRADY
		It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's--
			(stopping)
		Who said anything about girlfriend?

	James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you 
	kidding?

					GRADY
		Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my 
		girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't 
		exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no 
		reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, 
		the fact remains that I'm the one who took you 
		up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one 
		who has to take the blame. I- don't know what 
		the hell I was thinking.

					JAMES LEER
		Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap 
		gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 
		'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he 
		might never get on the bus again.' You were 
		thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract 
		this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a 
		noble act.

					GRADY
		Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never 
		done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever.

	James looks -out the window, pondering this.

					JAMES LEER
		So, why did you take me up there?

					GRADY
			(feeling for the heat again)
		I -don' t know, James . I don' t know why I do 
		half the things I do. Who does?
			(looking over)
		Why do you wear that coat?

	James looks down, a little defensive.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's warm.

					GRADY
		James, fall semester, first day of class, it 
		was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.

	James just blinks, no ready answer-available.

					GRADY
		That's why they all give you such a hard time 
		in workshop.

					JAMES LEER 
		Because of my coat?

					GRADY
		Because you act like a goddamn spook all the 
		time. Not to mention the fact that every last 
		one of them is jealous of you.

					JAMES LEER 
			(smirking) 
		Jealous? Of me?

					GRADY
		Not you. Your talent.

	James' face hardens. He looks away.

					JAMES LEER 
		You're lying.

					GRADY
		The hell I am.

					JAMES LEER
		Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You 
		said so yourself.

					GRADY
		I never said that.

					JAMES LEER
		Yes you did. Last night. To your friend 
		Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you 
		said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.

					GRADY
		I didn't mean it that way.

					JAMES LEER
		It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, 
		the others--they 're right. My stories are 
		annoying. They go on and on and on, and the 
		longer they go on the more annoying they 
		become, until finally you just want to grab 
		something heavy and--

					GRADY
		Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and 
		Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking 
		about, okay? The entire class combined-
		including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one 
		tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

	James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the 
	window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in 
	them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.

					JAMES LEER 
		But, last night...

					GRADY
		Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I 
		was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a 
		dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me 
		some slack?

					JAMES LEER 
			(quietly) 
		I'm sorry.

					GRADY
		And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares 
		what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a 
		good writer? You want to be-a great writer? 
		Then stop giving a damn what other people 
		think. Most of them haven't thought in .years.

	James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the 
	first headlights of the evening.

					GRADY
		Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books 
		don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not 
		anymore.

					JAMES LEER
		Arsonist's Daughter meant something.

	GRADY smiles contemptuously.

					JAMES LEER
		I mean it. It means something to me. It's one 
		of the reasons I came to school here. To be in 
		your class. To be taught by you.
			(quietly)
		It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a 
		writer.

	GRADY stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away 
	before the wide sweep of the Galaxie's headlights.

					GRADY
		Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I'm 
		sorry.

72	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL - OFF THE HIGHWAY - EVENING 

	GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James 
	slides out. GRADY
	stays put, hands still on the wheel.

					JAMES LEER
		You coming?

					GRADY
		In a minute. Get us a table.

	James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee 
	shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a 
	table with a view of the highway. GRADY
	watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into 
	the booth and open his big, laminated menu.

	Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY 
	kicks open his door, steps out.

73INT/	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER  

	GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he 
	speaks.

					GRADY
		C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm 
		sure. It's outside Scranton.

	GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by 
	himself on the far side of the coffee shop.

					GRADY
		You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at 
		this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a 
		resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd 
		be pretty interested to learn that the good 
		people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his 
		entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this 
		up as I go along--

	GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Never mind. My mistake.

74	EXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT     74

	GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An 
	AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of 
	CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows 
	peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch.

	He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice: 
	James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it 
	says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE 
	NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the 
	Greyhound depot who picks up.

75	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)

	The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as 
	he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE 
	PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars 
	that whip by on the highway beyond the window.

					JAMES LEER 
		Want a bite?

					GRADY
		No thanks.

					JAMES LEER
		That's why you're having them. Your spells.

					GRADY
		Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like 
		we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't 
		have spells.

					JAMES LEER 
		What would you call them then?

					GRADY
		I don't know. ...'Episodes.'

	James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.

					JAMES LEER
		It's because you don't eat.

					GRADY
		I eat.

					JAMES LEER
		When?

					GRADY
		When nobody's looking.

	GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...

					JAMES LEER
			(mouth full, garbled)
		I just worry about you, that's all.

	...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks 
	at him.

					GRADY
		You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?

					JAMES LEER
		Okay.

	Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against 
	the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking 
	lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		Where you going?

					GRADY
		Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.

	GRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and 
	his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.

76	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL   

	As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER 
	MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming 
	BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a 
	WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of 
	the sun visor.

					MAN
			(eyeing GRADY dubiously) 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Grady.

					MAN
		Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda.

					GRADY
			(re: their clothes)
		Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening.

					FRED LEER
		Hardly.

					AMANDA LEER
		We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck 
		would have it, the club was on the way, so... 
			(snapping shut the visor)
		We were able to put in an appearance.

					FRED LEER
		Otherwise we would've been here earlier.

					GRADY
		Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a 
		little dinner.

					FRED LEER
		Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.

					GRADY
		That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might 
		be good for James to be with his family this 
		weekend.

					FRED LEER
		Well, of course, we can understand that.

	GRADY considers the two glittering ghosts before him. 
	They seem to be waiting. Just waiting.

					GRADY
		Well. Let me go get him.

	GRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		I "hope you won't consider this forward of me, 
		Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you 
		ever attend Catholic school?

	Amanda Leer's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly.

					AMANDA LEER 
		Excuse me?

77	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP77 

	James is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not going with them..

					GRADY
		James. Listen. Things-things are a little 
		weird with me right now and I-- well--I have 
		enough blame to shoulder these days without 
		having to take the blame if something bad 
		happened to you. And if you hang around me long 
		enough, something bad is going to happen, trust 
		me. That's why I need you to go home. 
		Understand?

					JAMES LEER 
		I'm not going, with them.

					GRADY
		James, like it or not, they're your parents.

					JAMES LEER
		Parents? They're not my parents. They're my 
		grandparents. My parents are dead.

	GRADY stares at-James wearily.

					JAMES LEER
		I swear. My father had his own airplane he 
		used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and 
		my mom were flying up to our house in the 
		Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in 
		the newspaper.

	GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.

					JAMES LEER
		I 'swear. My father was a senior vice 
		president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite. 
		Her maiden name was Guggenheim.

	GRADY starts to protest, then pauses.

					GRADY
		I remember that. Five or six years ago.

					JAMES LEER
		Six. Their plane went down right outside 
		Scranton.

					GRADY 
			(sardonically) 
		Near Carvel?

					JAMES LEER
		I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like 
		to talk about my family. They treat me like a 
		freak. 
			(nodding towards Amanda)

	She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's 
	mine. My parents left it to me.

	GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the  
	contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.

					GRADY
		James, come on. That man is obviously your 
		father. You look just like him.

	James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and 
	speaks in a voice heavy with implication.

					JAMES LEER
		There's a reason for that.

	Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little 
	riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.

					GRADY
		Get out of here.

					JAMES LEER
		That's why she hates me. That's why she makes 
		me sleep in the basement.

					GRADY
		In the crawl space, with the rats and the 
		casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.

	As GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a 
	plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it.

					JAMES LEER 
		I swear.

78	EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER       78

	As Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes, GRADY 
	waves vaguely, peers into the darkness of the back seat.

					FRED LEER 
		Thank you. Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
		Take care of him.

					AMANDA LEER
		Oh, don't worry. We'll take care of him. You 
		can be sure of that.

	Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in 
	a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee 
	down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at 
	his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front 
	passenger seat, James' knapsack. GRADY grabs it, turns.

					GRADY
		Hey!

	GRADY'S POV - REAR WINDOW
	as the Mercedes begins to pull away and James turns, 
	elbows on the back dash, his pale face slack. Spying Grady, 
	he raises one limp hand, and then-as if it were held by a 
	string-lets it drop.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(softly) 
		Hey.

79	EXT. PARKING LOT - MQTEL/COFFEE SHOP - A. BIT LATER   

	GRADY sits in-the GREEN GLOW of .the radio dial, smoking 
	a joint. He glances at the knapsack, sees James' 
	MANUSCRIPT:

	The Love Parade

	He reaches in, takes the manuscript and, in the light 
	that rains from the PARKING LAMP overhead, begins to read.

80	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)      80

	Grady's HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block 
	full of nuns. MUSIC BLARES, LIGHT BLAZES from every window, 
	and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the 
	Galaxie in the middle of the street.


					GRADY
			(knowingly) 
		Crabtree.

81	INT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER  

	Times Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans 
	the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs.

82	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE  

	Hannah Green sits on the sofa, twisting a long strand of 
	hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT.

					GRADY
			(entering) 
		Hey.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Grady!

	She slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at 
	her thigh. GRADY
	stares. The manuscript. It's his.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(embarrassed)
		I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, 
		just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist 
		and-and--I suck.

					GRADY
		No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it 
		out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been 
		in here, has he? Poking around?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I don't know--maybe- I don't think so.

	Grady's  mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but 
	only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that 
		aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.

					HANNAH GREEN
		He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The 
		blind one.

					GRADY
		Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What?

					HANNAH GREEN
		At first the police thought he just ran away, 
		but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood 
		spots on the carpet -

					GRADY
		Jesus.

					HANNAH GREEN
		CRABTREE said it sounded like something James 
		would be messed up in.

					GRADY
		Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Who does?

	Just then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway 
	outside.

					CRABTREE (O.S.) 
		Trip?! Where are you'

	GRADY looks anxiously toward the door.

					GRADY
		The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James 
		that day?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I told you, Sewickly Heights.      

					GRADY
		But where? I need the street.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a 
		corner. 

					CRABTREE (O.S.)
		Trip?!

					GRADY
		Shit.

	As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger 
	inside his belt buckle.

					HANNAH GREEN
		No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for 
		you.

	GRADY looks at Hannah's hand, where it rests. He looks 
	terrified.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but 
		right now I--

					CRABTREE
			(bursting in)
		Tripp, where the hell. . .

	CRABTREE stops, takes in the tableau before him.

					CRABTREE (cont'd)
		Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student-
		teacher conference?

	GRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle, 
	points at Crabtree.

					GRADY
		You stay there.

					CRABTREE
		What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

	CRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked 
	on Grady's desk.

					CRABTREE
		Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would 
		sneak in here and read your book without asking 
		you?

					GRADY
		Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to 
		remember you actually asking me if you could 
		invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

					CRABTREE
		Sometimes we have to improvise.

					GRADY
			(ignoring him)
		Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I 
		mean, besides you and. ..me?

					CRABTREE
		James? My James? What's happened?

					GRADY
		Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't 
		know.. .kidnapped.

					CRABTREE
		Kidnapped? By who?

					GRADY
		His parents.

					CRABTREE
		Good God. Let's go rescue him.

					GRADY
		Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don't 
		know where they live.

					CRABTREE
		Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know 
		where he lives.

					GRADY
		It's a little late to call Admissions.

					CRABTREE
		Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?

					GRADY
		Maybe ...I don't know.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Two-sixty-two Baxter Drive.

	GRADY and CRABTREE turn, see Hannah sitting on the corner 
	of Grady's desk with the WHITE PAGES open on her lap.

					HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)
		They're in the book.

83	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - TEN MINUTES LATER

	CRABTREE snaps James' manuscript closed.

					CRABTREE
		You know--based on what I've read-- this is a 
		very exciting piece of material, this Big 
		Parade.

					GRADY
		Love. It's Love facade--and what do you mean 
		'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two 
		chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling 
		methamphetamines.

					CRABTREE
		I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I 
		feel this kid in my bones.

					GRADY
		Only in your bones?

	GRADY smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise; 
	CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay. He 
	just stares out the window, his voice distant.

					CRABTREE
		No. I think I might be right. I've felt it 
		before...

	As Crabtree's voice trails off, GRADY studies him.

					GRADY
		How bad is it for you?

					CRABTREE
		Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit 
		the new corporate profile.

					GRADY
		Which is?

					CRABTREE
		Competence.

	GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment, then 
	CRABTREE smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James' 
	knapsack, rummaging through the contents.

					CRABTREE (cont'd) 
		So tell me about you and the Chancellor.

					GRADY
		What's to tell?

					CRABTREE
		Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...

	CRABTREE fishes out the biography of Erroll Flynn, gives 
	it a look.

					CRABTREE
		...I like her.

	GRADY peers at the stars, his voice barely audible.

					GRADY
		Me too.

84	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SEWICKLEY HEIGHTS     84-

	The battered Galaxie floats up a narrow road, gliding 
	through a canyon of mansion walls and the occasional 
	winding drive. Up ahead a stone post marker with the 
	numerals "262." GRADY kills the headlights.

					GRADY
		This is it.

84A	EXT. LEER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Grady--limping like an aging prizefighter--leads CRABTREE 
	up a steep incline toward an enormous three-story house. 
	The Leer's Mercedes gleams in the shadows.

					CRABTREE
		Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on . 
		that thing. How are we-supposed to find his?

					GRADY
		I told you. They keep him chained in the 
		basement. Come on.

85	EXT. REAR - LEER HOUSE

	LIGHT GLOWS from a low BASEMENT WINDOW. From one side, a 
	WOMAN is HEARD SINGING. GRADY and CRABTREE pause, listen.

					WOMAN SINGING 
		Why should I care though he gave me the air? 
		Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why? 
		And wonder why?

					CRABTREE
		Doris Day.

	CRABTREE and GRADY look at each other.

					GRADY/CRABTREE
		James Leer.

	GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass. A moment 
	later, James peeks out. Seeing Grady, his face brightens 
	briefly, unguarded, then quickly resumes its usual Leerian 
	aspect. He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."

86	EXT. BASEMENT DOOR    

	The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in 
	a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the 
	seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.

					JAMES LEER
		Hey. What are you guys doing here?

					CRABTREE
		We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on.

	As they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once-
	over.

					GRADY
		I can't believe you made fun of my robe.

87	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT    87

	Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose 
	walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There 
	are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and 
	an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY.

					CRABTREE
		I like what you've done with it. When's 
		Captain Nemo moving in?

					JAMES LEER 
		The candelabras were my Gran's.

					GRADY
		Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll 
		leave you here.

					CRABTREE
		Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the 
		grandparents, the China town thing-- and I 
		believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now 
		go get dressed.

	James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning.

					JAMES LEER
		Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this 
		again. Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Ah, wear whatever you want.

	James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.

					CRABTREE
		So modest.

					GRADY
		So sensitive.

					CRABTREE
			(nosing around the room)
		Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.

					GRADY
		It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just 
		once I'd like to know if the little bastard is 
		telling the truth.

					CRABTREE
		The-truth. I know that's always been real 
		important to you. Key, check this out...

	CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from 
	the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage.

					CRABTREE
		Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to: 
		see him, shuffling into the room like an aging 
		prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.'
			(with an amused smile) 
		Sound like anyone we know?
			(resuming) 
		But it was later, when the great man squinted 
		into the bitter glow or twilight...
			(frowning)
		Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely 
		needs an editor.
			(resuming)
	...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it. 
	Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the 
	boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in 
	a darker place. His heart...'

	CRABTREE stops abruptly.

					GRADY
		Yes? 'His heart...'

	CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:

					CRABTREE
		'His heart, once capable of inspiring others 
		so completely, could no longer inspire so much 
		as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It 
		beat now only because it could. '

	GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns.

					JAMES LEER 
		I'm ready...

	James stops, sees the two men looking at him.

					JAMES LEER 
		You all right, Professor Tripp?

					CRABTREE
		He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol' 
		Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.

					JAMES LEER
		Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming 
		down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, 
		check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call 
		the police or.. .something.

					CRABTREE
		Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows 
		and one of your teddy bears under the spread 
		and she won't know the difference.

					JAMES LEER 
			(brightening)
		Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use 
		a couple big hams.

					GRADY
		No.

	CRABTREE and James turn.

					GRADY
		I've got something better than a teddy bear.

	CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' 
	bed. 

88	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 

	GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently 
	adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps 
	back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment.

					GRADY
		Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

89	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - LATER 

	The lights are still blazing, the front door is wide 
	open, but not a soul remains.

90	INT. LIVING ROOM

	A quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on 
	the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the 
	TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and 
	GRADY appear.

					CRABTREE
		Things must've picked up after we left.

	CRABTREE pats Grady's cheek, heads upstairs. 

91	INT. HALLWAY

	Crabtree's door is closing as GRADY hobbles into view.

					GRADY
		Crabtree.

					CRABTREE
			(sticking his head out) 
		Ye-es?

	GRADY looks down, sees James Leer's black brogues sitting 
	on the floor outside Crabtree's door.

					GRADY
		Nothing.

	The door closes, the LATCH CLICKS, and GRADY is left 
	alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air.

92	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM 

	Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by 
	little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her, 
	then detects something on the floor. The red boots.

	Delicately, he lifts the sheet. Hannah Green's feet-- 
	finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be 
	thick, wide, and ordinary. GRADY
	sighs.

93	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE 

	The TV is on. GRADY steps to the doorway, pauses.

					VOICE 
		Hey.

	A HEAD cranes over the sofa. It's the Goatee Kid from 
	Thaw Hail.

					GRADY
		How are you--is it Joe?

					GOATEE KID
		Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your 
		house until about an hour ago.

					GRADY
		Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.

					GOATEE KID
		Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, 
		what I said that time in office hours-I hope 
		there's no hard feelings.

					GRADY
		No...

					GOATEE KID
		I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at 
		the time and my car was ail fucked up and--
		well--I was pretty bent in general.

					GRADY
		It's cool, Jeff. Really.

					GOATEE KID
		I just want you to know that's why I dropped 
		your class and said all that shit about the 
		university stealing my money and you being a 
		pseudo-Faulknerian nobody.

94	EXT. PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (A BIT LATER)

	GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in 
	his fingers. To his left, perched atop a Haagen-Dazs 
	container, is a TELEPHONE. As he pulls it into his lap, a 
	LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free of 
	the cord, and SHATTERS on the floor.

	GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the 
	CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears. 
	Stenciled on its side panel is:

	Kravnik's Sporting Goods

	The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past 
	Grady's house and disappears around the corner. GRADY 
	frowns, then realizes a MAN'S VOICE is coming from the 
	RECEIVER in his lap.

					MAN (O.S. ) 
		Hello? Hello...?

	The VOICE is groggy. It is Walter Gaskell's voice.

					GRADY
		Walter?

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Yes?

	GRADY says nothing, as if wondering what he's doing.

					WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd) 
		Who's this ?

					GRADY
		It's Grady, Walter.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Grady?

					GRADY
		GRADY Tripp. English Department.

					WALTER'S VOICE
		I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, 
		Grady, do you know what time it -is?

					GRADY
			(looking at his watch)
		I have ...eight-fifteen. That's not right, is 
		it?

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		It's three-thirty, Grady.

					GRADY
		This is important.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Oh? 

					GRADY
		I... I...

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		What is it, Grady?

					GRADY
		I'm in love with your wife.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Excuse me?

					GRADY
		Sara. I'm in love with her.

	Silence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even, 
	administrative.

					WALTER'S VOICE
		Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now.

	GRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice.

					GRADY
		No. 

					WALTER'S VOICE
		Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office 
		Monday morning.

	As the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone, 
	wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's 
	just done.

95	EXT. GRADY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY)

	A CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling 
	from-the window.

96	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

	A heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks. 
	Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the 
	piece of paper curling from his typewriter.

	GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE

	It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time. 
	Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD. 
	GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the 
	curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara.

97	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE

	GRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a 
	BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn..

					GRADY
		Sara.

					SARA
		I tried to call, but apparently there's 
		something wrong...

	Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was 
		ringing loud and clear this morning.

	GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure 
	it's not good.

					GRADY
		Oh?

					SARA
		It seems one of our students is - missing and 
		his parents found a dead dog in his bed.

					GRADY
			(slumping to the porch)
		I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. 
		It's all my-

	Sara raises her hand, silencing him.

					SARA
		I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. 
		But more importantly, Walter's not very happy 
		and he's gotten the police involved. They seem 
		to think James Leer is somehow responsible for 
		all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where 
		James is, would you, Grady?

					GRADY
		Inside.

					SARA 
		And the jacket?

					GRADY
		Over there. In the backseat of the...

	Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to 
	the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil 
	stain roughly the shape of North Dakota.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Someone stole my car.

					SARA
		Grady.

					GRADY
		Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it 
		right there last night.

					SARA
		Are you sure you parked it there?

					GRADY
		Of course, I'm sure.  Ah, Christ, the puberty 
		police are back.

	Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb.

					SARA
		I'll deal with this. You dig up James.

98	INT. CRABTREE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The 
	Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the 
	. sole visible part of .James Leer.

					GRADY
			(swinging in)
		Is he awake?

					CRABTREE
		I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

					GRADY
		Nevertheless. There's a police officer 
		standing on the porch and I don't think he's 
		going away.

					JAMES LEER
			(from under the covers) 
		That same guy?

	CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one 
	eye.

					JAMES LEER 
		You snore.

					CRABTREE
		So I hear.

					JAMES LEER 
			(studying Grady)
		No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look 
		sorta crappy.

					CRABTREE
		He's right, you look horrible.

					GRADY
		Thank you, Frankie and Annette.

	James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks 
	bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's the Chancellor.

					CRABTREE
		Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.

					GRADY
		And we both thank you for that, but we're... 
		we're... fine.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.

	GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants.

					GRADY
		Shut up, James.

					CRABTREE
		So what's the problem?

					GRADY
			(a tad tense)
		There is no problem. Did I say there was a 
		problem?

	As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned 
	flannel, he and CRABTREE
	exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and 
	excluding Grady.

					SARA (0. S.)
		How's it coming back there, Professor Tripp?

					CRABTREE
		Who's that?

					GRADY
		Who do you think it is?

					CRABTREE
		The Chancellor's here? Now?

					GRADY
		Evidently. 
			(calling)
		Coming!     

					JAMES LEER
		Does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?

					GRADY
		It's Walter's dog and yes, she does. Know. But 
		let's spare her the details. Come on, your 
		shoes are in the hail.

					CRABTREE
		James. This book of yours. It's not bad. Not 
		bad at all.

	James stops, considers this piece of news with a look of 
	deep seriousness, then nods.

					JAMES LEER 
		Thank you.

					CRABTREE
		You're welcome.

	As James shuffles off into the hail, CRABTREE looks at 
	Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement.


					CRABTREE
		I want to publish this.  I've got to.  I think 
		they'll let me.  With a little editorial 
		guidance it could be brilliant. 

					GRADY
		Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out 
		there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been 
		awhile since somebody wrote a good book in 
		jail.

99	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Sara and GRADY stand by as Pete Pupcik deposits James in 
	the back of the squad car, SLAMS the door.

	PUPCIK
	As I told the Chancellor, Professor, I'm. just going to 
	run James here over to the university. It'll be up to Dr. 
	Gaskell where we go from there.

	GRADY nods, leans in the window to James.

					GRADY
		Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		I'm a little worried, James.

					JAMES LEER 
		Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I 
		probably should be expelled.

					GRADY
		Well, let's see if we can keep that from 
		happening.

	James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car.

					JAMES LEER
		Professor Tripp...?

					GRADY
		Yes, James.

					JAMES LEER
		Even if I end up going to jail....

	James smiles his crooked grin.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		You're still the best teacher I ever had.

	On this,  Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing 
	on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in 
	the rear  window of the police car, growing smaller.

					SARA
		This is not what the university has in mind 
		when it promises a liberal education, Grady.

					GRADY
		Would Walter really press charges?

					SARA
		It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs 
		pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit 
		prickly this morning.

	Grady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches 
	her take a drag on her cigarette.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		You didn't happen to call the house last 
		night, did you, Grady?

					GRADY
		I think I might have.

					SARA
		And what do you think you might have said?

					GRADY
		I think I might've said I was in love with 
		you.

	Sara's face remains .unchanged.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		He told you.

					SARA 
		He told me.

					GRADY
		And what did you say?

					SARA
		I said it didn't sound like you. 

	Sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her 
	car, and dives away.  GRADY looks after her sadly, then 
	turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt 
	which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."

					CRABTREE
		So- what do we do now? ,

					GRADY
		Find the jacket.

					CRABTREE
		Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that?

					GRADY
		First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her 
		car.

					CRABTREE
		It seems to me that girl would let you borrow 
		her pancreas.

100	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM   - 100

	Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she 
	listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the 
	foot of-her bed, fully clothed.

					GOATEE KID
		I'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent 
		homosexual love. Look at the way they dance--
		it's sodomy.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(laughing) 
		Stop it.

	Hannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes. 
	She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Grady. Hi. What's up?

	Jeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily.

					GOATEE KID
		I'll be ...somewhere else.

					GRADY
		Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in 
		discussing that business with the tango, try 
		the guy at the end of the hall.

	Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks.

					GRADY
		He cribbed that from Borges.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It beats 'What's your major?'

	GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.

					GRADY
		Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could 
		borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of 
		commission.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to. 
		..to your book.

	The hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a 
	cloud.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I uh, I didn't finish, I ...fell asleep.

					GRADY
		That good, hub?

					HANNAH GREEN
		No, it's not that, it's...

	Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her 
	dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It's just that, you know, I was thinking about 
		how, in class, you're always telling us '-that 
		writers make choices--at least the good ones. 
		And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the 
		book isn't really great-I mean, really great-
		but at times it's, well, very detailed, you 
		know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses 
		and ail the dental records and so on-and I 
		don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of 
		reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... 
			(with trepidation)
	...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was 
	wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you 
	wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.

					GRADY
			(stung)
		Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as 
		shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first 
		writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, 
		it might interest you to know that one book I 
		wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' 
		happened to win a little something called the 
		PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under 
		the influence. '

	Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels 
	ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathers 
	his manuscript and exits.

101	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER   

	Crabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's 
	arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs.

					CRABTREE
		Want some help with that?

					GRADY
			(passing by)
		Don't touch it.

102	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT - MOVING  

	CRABTREE sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling 
	Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random. 
	GRADY rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his 
	clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a 
	watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic.

					CRABTREE
		Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes 
		you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his 
		car.

					GRADY
		Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't 
		exactly Jerry's to give.

					CRABTREE
		So whose car is it?

					GRADY
		My guess-Vernon Hardapple.

					CRABTREE
		The hood jumper?

					GRADY
		He said a few things that lead me to believe 
		the car's his.

					CRABTREE
		Such as.

					GRADY
		'That's my car, motherfucker.'

					CRABTREE
		Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. 
		We find the car...

					GRADY
		...we find the jacket.

					CRABTREE
		There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know 
		his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we 
		made the whole guy up.

					GRADY
		No wonder he screwed us over.

	CUT TO:

	BILL MAZEROSKI legendary Pittsburgh Pirate second 
	baseman, large as a Macy's Day float, his weathered image 
	scaling three floors on the BRICK face of a RIVERFRONT 
	STOREFRONT.

103	INT. HANNAH'S CAR

	CRABTREE takes a corner recklessly, immediately slows, 
	and blinks in amazement.

					CRABTREE
		Christ, Tripp. How did you know?

					GRADY
		Call it a hunch.

	Parked in front of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS is the white 
	van. A few feet behind, the battered Galaxie.

					CRABTREE
		I'd call it genius.

	GRADY steps out, strips off the robe, and drops the lumpy 
	leviathan that is his manuscript on the front seat.

					GRADY
		It's good to know I'm still talented at 
		something. Keep the motor running.

104	EXT./	INT. GALAXIE    104

	GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND 
	that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at 
	him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box, 
	and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets it 
	anyway, then spies something else.

	James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL.

	GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS 
	off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a 
	SWEET, SOFT BLUR...

105	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT 

	CRABTREE stomps on his Kool. GRADY looks very much like a 
	man who has pulled off the road to take a nap.

					CRABTREE
		What the hell...

106	INT. GALAXIE

	As GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel, a CLOUD 
	appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and GRADY realizes 
	it's not a cloud at all, it's

	MARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror, wearing a 
	bright pink dress under her wedding jacket.

					MARILYN 
		I know you. . .

	Marilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's 
	something wrong with it. This girl's eyes are brown and 
	besides, she's ...fat.

					MARILYN (cont'd) 
		Double Dickel on the rocks.

	The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds- 
	standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn 
	Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from 
	the Hi-Hat Club.

					GRADY
		Oola.

					OOLA 
		I never forget a drink.

					GRADY
		I never forget an Oola.

	Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.

					MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) 
		Forget me?

	GRADY starts to turn, but his head won't  move: largely 
	because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his 
	temple. Grady's eyes slide.

					GRADY
		Vernon.

					VERNON
			(to Oola)
		Move away, cupcake.  He's got a gun.

					GRADY
		Who's got a gun?

					VERNON 
		You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

					GRADY
		Relax, Vernon...

					OOLA 
		Why's he calling you Vernon?

					VERNON
		Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's 
		why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.

					GRADY
		Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. 
		Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon 
		Peabody at Penguin U.K.

					VERNON 
		Shut up. 
			(to Oola)
		Cupcake. Please. Inside.

					OOLA 
		You' re not going to shoot him, are you?

					VERNON
		I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that 
		gun down.

					GRADY
		It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the 
		caps anymore.

					VERNON
		Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And 
		that's a gun.

					GRADY
		No, really....

	GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled 
	pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead.

107	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT

	CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's 
	arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.

					CRABTREE
		Holy shit.

108	EXT. KRAVNIKS 

	Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned.

					VERNON 
		Are you crazy!

	The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares 
	at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand.

					VERNON (cont'd)
		Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you 
		see the condition my girl's in?

	As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on 
	Oola's tummy.

					VERNON 
		You all right, cupcake?

					OOLA 
		Who's Vernon?

	A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching 
	asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah 
	Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them.

					VERNON 
		What the...?

	Gears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails 
	wildly, then kicks open the passenger door.

					CRABTREE
		Tripp! Run!

	GRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as 
	CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then 
	turns back for another pass.

					VERNON
		Who the hell is that?

					GRADY
		A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon 
		girl's clutch.

	The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree-- 
	swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken 
	flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady, 
	Vernon, and Oola.

					VERNON 
		Woah.

	Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine.

					VERNON (cont'd) 
		Pull off, you crazy motherfucker!

	Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and 
	the oncoming Crabtree.

					GRADY
		No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver.

	CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the 
	passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a 
	FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky.

	Only, these ain't birds.   - ^

					GRADY
		Oh... my... God! 

	These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages.

	CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and 
	smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI 
	painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS.

	As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free 
	of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail 
	the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the 
	Ohio River. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
			(to Vernon)
		I take it back.  Shoot him. 

109	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING

	Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE 
	puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly 
	with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED 
	PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.

					CRABTREE
		Naturally you have copies.

					GRADY
		I have an alternate version of the first 
		chapter. 

					CRABTREE
		You'll be all right then.  Look at Carlyle, 
		when he lost his luggage.

					GRADY
		That was MacCaulay.

					CRABTREE
		Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those 
		stories.

					GRADY
		He was never able to reproduce them.

					CRABTREE
		Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to 
		depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a 
		sense- this--
			(nodding to the pages)
		is for the best.

	Grady's eyes shift, study Crabtree.

					GRADY
		Kind of a sign, you're saying.

					CRABTREE
		In a sense.

					GRADY
		I don't think so. In my experience, signs are 
		usually a lot more subtle.

					VERNON
		Let me get this straight. All that paper that 
		went into the river. That was the only copy?

					GRADY
		'Fraid so.

					VERNON
			(glowering at Crabtree)
		And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What 
		the fuck's the matter with you?

					CRABTREE
		I'm just saying that sometimes, 
		subconsciously, a person will put themselves in 
		a situation-perhaps even create that situation-
		in order to have an arena in which to work out
		an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you 
		will, of addressing a problem.

	Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if he's from another planet.

					VERNON
		I'll tell you the problem. You behind the 
		wheel. There's your fucking problem.

					CRABTREE
		That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?

					VERNON
		Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights 
		in the middle of the street none of this 
		happens.

					CRABTREE
		Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun 
		to his head?

					VERNON
		He was trying to steal my car!

					GRADY
		Ail right, all right It's done. There's no 
		need to talk about it. It's done.

	They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns, 
	glances at GRADY
	and his little sheaf of pages.

					OOLA 
		So what was it about? 
			(as GRADY looks up)
		Your book.  What was the story?

	GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.

					GRADY
		I don't know...

	Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend, 
	genuine compassion in his eyes.

					CRABTREE
		What he means is, it's difficult to distill 
		the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in 
		the mind.

					VERNON
		Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, 
		right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was 
		about, why were you writing it?

					GRADY
		I couldn't stop.

110	EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE

	Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with 
	CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare 
	to leave in the Galaxie.


					GRADY
		Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?

					VERNON 
		Shoot.

	GRADY glances at little round Oola.

					GRADY
		Boy or girl?

					VERNON
		As long as it looks like her, I don't care. 
		You know what I'm saying?

	GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.

					GRADY
		Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

					VERNON
		No sweat. Only do me a favor?

					GRADY
		Sure.

					VERNON 
		Stop calling me Vernon.

	CRABTREE leans into Grady, WHISPERS.

					CRABTREE
		The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...

					OOLA 
		Yea?

	GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, 
	snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.

					GRADY
		It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had 
		small shoulders, like you. Most people don't 
		know that.

	As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.

					VERNON
		Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty 
		motherfucking ride.

	Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into 
	Grady, and pulls away. CRABTREE stands stunned.

					CRABTREE
		You mind explaining what you just did?

	GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping 
	NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.

					GRADY
		Came to my senses. CRABTREE

		Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is 
		James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell 
		to come to his?

					GRADY
		Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer 
		to jail, Crabs. I know that.

					CRABTREE
		Do you know he won't expel him?

					GRADY
		No. But I don't think that matters.

					CRABTREE
		That's very enlightened, Professor. It's 
		comforting to know that America's children have 
		you for a teacher.

	GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the 
	buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.

					GRADY
		Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell 
		them what you know. You tell them to find their 
		voice and stick with it, because that's all you 
		have in the end. You tell the ones who have it 
		to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't 
		to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way 
		to get where you're going. 
			(ruefully) 
		Of course, it helps if you know where you want 
		to go. 
			(thoughtfully)
		Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--
		that's made the last seven years worthwhile.

	GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles 
	cryptically as he considers it. -

					GRADY (cont'd)
		As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...

	Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		He's got you.

	CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, 
	watches GRADY walk away.

					CRABTREE
		Me? What can I do?

					GRADY
		Gee, I don't know, Crabs...
			(over his shoulder)
		Improvise. You're good at that.

	GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as 
	he walks toward the buildings in the distance.

					CRABTREE
		I'm sorry, Tripp.

	GRADY stops, turns.

					GRADY
		You peeked, didn't you?

					CRABTREE
		I peeked. 

	GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter 
	anymore

					CRABTREE
		It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a 
		lot to admire. I've ...never read anything 
		quite like it.

	If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, 
	Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, 
	and show. And GRADY knows it.

					GRADY
		You're not just trying to make me feel better?

	CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.

					CRABTREE
		Scout's honor.

	CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are 
	acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.

					GRADY
		Well, thanks for that, Crabs.

111	INT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT 

	Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the 
	stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.

112	INT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks.

	He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two 
	afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill 
	breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the 
	barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. 
	turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his 
	pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his 
	manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half 
	length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner 
	down into a triangle along the first crease...

113	EXT. QUAD  

	A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER 
	AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring 
	then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.

114	INT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER

	GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the 
	auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies 
	Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.

					GRADY
		Sara!

	Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles 
	forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.

					Q
		Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look 
		at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's 
		a description of a bald cypress that left' me 
		breathless.

					GRADY
			(pushing past him)
		Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank 
		teller's breasts in your last one.

115	INT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL

	GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way 
	behind the back row, scanning the aisles.

					GIRL'S VOICS 
		Hey, Professor Tripp.

	It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. 
	GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- 
	next to her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the 
		aisle.

					GRADY
		No...

	But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the 
	aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming. 
	The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to 
		be in workshop?

					GRADY
		Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango 
		dancers.

116	INT. MAIN STAGE

	Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.

					WALTER
		And now, as those of you who've been with us 
		in previous years know, we have a tradition of 
		sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of 
		course, of The Plums.

	An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as 
	Walter begins to read from a separate list.

					WALTER
		This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock, 
		found a publisher for her children's book. The 
		Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.

117	INT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^

	As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause, 
	GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his 
	surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the 
	front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily 
	complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing 
	CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.

					WALTER
		And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for 
		his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has 
		found a home with Putnam for his new Three 
		Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.

	A SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE 
	takes a shift in tone.

					WALTER
		Now, this next one, I think, is especially 
		exciting to announce, because it concerns a 
		student here at the university. Our own James 
		Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has 
		found a publisher for his first novel, which I 
		believe is called The Lovely Parade.

	GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile 
	warmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in 
	the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned, 
	Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
		I have a class with him.

	James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the 
	APPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know 
		what I mean.

	Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups 
	Hi his hands around his mouth.

					GRADY
		Take a bow, James!

	James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish 
	grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and 
	takes his first sweet public bow.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(softly)
		Wonder Boy.

					WALTER
		And finally--and perhaps not least 
		importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has 
		also decided to publish my own book--a critical 
		exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and 
		Joe DiMaggio and its function in American 
		mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled 
		The Last American Marriage.     "

	Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically, 
	watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.     
	. :

					WALTER 
		Until next year. Thank you, everyone.

	The LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE 
	shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah 
	Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms 
	around James.

	GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when 
	suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says 
	something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. 
	GRADY blinks, scrambles up.

118	INT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY bursts into the corridor.'

					GRADY
		Sara!

	Its empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL 
	DOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.

119	INT. NEW CORRIDOR

	Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He 
	moves to it, pushes past...

120	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans 
	out over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very. 
	steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of 
	basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and 
	a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.

	GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes 
	against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his 
	ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of- 
	marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating 
	atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The 
	SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're 
	Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.

	It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.

					GRADY
		Yo, Traxler.

					TRAXLER 
			(looking up)
		Hey, Professor Tripp.

	GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.

					GRADY
		Do you get high, Sam?

					TRAXLER
		Only when I'm working.

	GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc.  It 
	pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's 
	feet.

					TRAXLER 
		Holy shit. Are you serious?

					GRADY
		As a heart attack.

					TRAXLER
		Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...

	GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy 
	now. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on 
	a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...

	...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON 
	caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.

					SARA
		Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?

	GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.

					GRADY
		Looking for you.

	He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL 
	GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...

	faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's 
	name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH 
	upward until we see that she is...

	KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.

121	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue 
	plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the 
	curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips 
	slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW 
	fall outside.

	The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then 
	the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. 
	His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.

					GRADY
		I passed out.

					GREENHUT
		You did.

					GRADY
		I've been doing that a lot lately.

					GREENHUT
		So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of 
		marijuana, I understand.

					GRADY
		Do you think that's why I've been having 
		these...
			(grabbing James' term)
		 ... spells?

					GREENHUT
		How long have you been having them?

					GRADY
		The last month maybe.

					GREENHUT
		How long have you been smoking marijuana?

					GRADY
		Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

					GREENHUT
		That's probably not the problem, then. What 
		about your lifestyle. Any major changes 
		recently?

					GRADY
		I've been trying to finish a book...

					GREENHUT
		And your wife left you.

					GRADY
		Is that in my chart?

					GREENHUT
		I spoke with the woman who saved your life. 
		You're lucky she came along when she did.

	GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this 
	statement

					GRADY
		I know.

					GREENHUT
			(tapping the glucose bottle)
		You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An 
		internist. And I think you really ought to 
		consider seeing a therapist, as well.

					GRADY
		She told you about. . .

					GREENHUT
		Her dog, yes.

					GRADY
		Actually, it was her husband's dog...

	Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the 
	first time, and GRADY
	stops.

					GREENHUT
		Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all 
		right? On top of that, you have a bite on your 
		ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you 
		with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another 
		day or two and you might have lost the foot. As 
		for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result 
		of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.

					GRADY
		They're anxiety attacks? That's a little 
		disappointing.

					GREENHUT
		Better luck next time.

					GRADY
		So is my friend...is Sara still here?

					GREENHUT
		No. There's no one here.

					GRADY
		I have to see her. As soon as possible.

	Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in 
	his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.

					GREENHUT
		Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, 
		I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a 
		prescription for a course of ampicillin and I 
		want you to follow it to the end-no matter how 
		stupid you decide to be with everything else. 
		All right?

122	INT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON

	GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around 
	him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that 
	connects one building to another.

					GRADY
		I wonder if you could show me something. 

123	EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES 
	on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple 
	and crazy with veins.

					GRADY
		Are these the only ones you have?

	The nurse's eyes crinkle.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Kidding... 

124	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,     looks at 
	the Gaskell house.

125	EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER

	GRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window.  
	Dark.  He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, 
	standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting 
	onto its roof, melting.

126	EXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S

	GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the 
	glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he 
	pulls away, but not before leaving...

	...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the 
	frost of the glass.

127	EXT. STREET  127

	The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the 
	street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self 
	on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. 
	..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little 
	pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, 
	then looks up into the sky.

	GRADY'S POV - of the SKY... 

	...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters 
	the silence.

	NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his 
	hand.

					GRADY
			(as if addressing God) 
		Is that a suggestion?

	GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO 
	SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen 
	DS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops. 

	GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts 
	himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara 
	makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- 
	not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.

					GRADY
		I'm so glad to see you, Sara.

					SARA
		I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you 
		out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?

					GRADY
		I'm through improvising. 

					SARA
		Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true? 
		Did you lose it all?

					GRADY
		I lost it ail.

					SARA
		Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.

					GRADY
		I know.

					SARA 
		And you're old.

	Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her 
	fingers. Yanks.

					GRADY
		Ouch. How many?

					SARA 
		Dozens. It's very sad.

	Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes 
	when she looks into his, and-she glances away.

					GRADY
		I went and looked at-some babies just now.

					SARA
		Oh?

					GRADY
			(trying to make her laugh)
		I guess you have to go on faith.

					SARA
			(she doesn't)
		Some times...

	GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the 
	HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.

					GRADY
		Did you tell Walter?

					SARA
		I told Walter. 

					GRADY
		Does he still love you?

					SARA
		It didn't come up. 

	GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious 
	profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.

					GRADY
		Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I 
		didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been 
		waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're 
		who I need. Because nothing makes sense without 
		you. Because the best moment of every day is 
		the moment I first see your face. And because 
		when you leave a room, there's no reason to be 
		in it any more. It's just a room again.

	Sara cocks her head.

					SARA 
		Did you just make that up?

					GRADY
			(shaking his head)
		In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about 
		it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy 
		painkillers.

	She frowns good-naturedly. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Even so...it's still true. Every word.

	Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might 
		tell you...

	Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...

					SARA 
		Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.

	GRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.

					GRADY
		You don't deserve me, you know.

					SARA
		I know, but sometimes... 

	Sara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening. 

					SARA (cont'd) 
		You just go on faith.

	GRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, 
	drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other 
	side of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door, 
	the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft 
	veil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are 
	lost too, nothing more than a blur.

          screaming fans at Madison Square Garden.
          
          The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over
          the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary:
          
          ----"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!"
          
          ----"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!"

          A PHOTO of Randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms
          pressed against the sides of his head like RAM'S HORNS.
          
          ----"Uh-oh, the horns are out... Here it comes..."
          
          We FREEZE on a final image of Randy FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE
          CANVAS, horns out, poised to crash down on The Ayatollah.
          
          ----"Ram Jam! Lights out!!"
          
          Over this, the sound of the crowd GOING CRAZY.

          INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the
          same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys
          locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school.
          
          CHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER
          
          He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green
          ram's horns run up the sides. They're the same kind of tights
          as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair.
          
          Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy,
          sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over
          his body. Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's
          just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills
          with a beer.
          
          Promoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with
          BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches.
          
                               SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    Great show, Ram. Ya turned it out.
                        (a little sad)
                    As always.
          
          He hands Randy some cash. Randy counts it. It's not much.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I was sure the gate'd be
                    bigger.
          
          Randy just shrugs resignedly.
          
          
          EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the
          school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the
          entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s.
          
                              FAN #1
                    Yo, Ram. Think you could...?
          
          Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from
          the `80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL
          PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up.
          
          Randy takes the program, happy to oblige.
          
                              FAN #1 (CONT'D)
                    I was there.
          
                                                                     3.
          
          
          Randy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER.
          The faded, mid-'80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging,
          crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the
          top, it says "EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!"
          
                              FAN #2
                        (as Randy signs)
                    My first match ever was you versus
                    Davey Diamond at the Spectrum.
                        (NOSTALGIC)
                    1985...
          
          Randy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the
          poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood.
          
                              FAN #2 (CONT'D)
                        (vaguely sad)
                    You were awesome.
          
          Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering
          thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left
          standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen.
          
          He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in.
          Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song.
          
          MUSIC: CINDERELLA - "DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT (TIL IT'S GONE)"
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is driving. On the dashboard is an old ACTION FIGURE OF
          HIMSELF from his WWF days. On the stereo, a different song
          plays, later in the same album.
          
          MUSIC: CINDERELLA   - "FIRE AND ICE"
          
          Randy pulls into the entrance gate of PARADISE OAKS TRAILER
          PARK.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy parks in front of his TRAILER. He gets out and heads
          toward it. A dismayed look comes over his face.
          
          RANDY'S POV: The door is PADLOCKED.
          
          He tugs on the lock. Tugs on the door. No dice.
          
          He violently kicks the padlock in a moment of rage.
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy resignedly climbs into the BACK OF HIS VAN.
          
          
          INT. BACK OF VAN - LATER
          
          Randy lies on a scrunched-up mattress on the floor, unable to
          sleep.
          
          The van wall is decorated with a MINI-SHRINE Randy has built
          to himself. Old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini-
          posters, etc. A few changes of clothes lie in a messy heap in
          the corner.
          
          He grabs a bottle of pills and pops a few, washing them down
          with a beer. He closes his eyes, trying to unwind.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. BACK OF VAN - NEXT MORNING
          
          Randy is asleep in his clothes from the night before. He's
          STIRRED AWAKE by the sound of kids YELLING and BANGING on the
          outside of van.
          
                              KID'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Ram!
          
          He slowly sits upright, massaging his pain-wracked knees.
          Every inch of him feels like shit.
          
                              ANOTHER KID'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Raaam!
          
          RANDY'S POV: Through the front windshield, TWO 8-YEAR-OLD
          KIDS, boosted by TWO OTHER KIDS, are peering in.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is playfully tussling with the four kids. He picks one
          of them up and "bodyslams" him.
          
                              RANDY
                        (announcer voice)
                    Oh, my... look out!
          
          He picks up another one and fake-drops him on his head.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Suplex!
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          He slams a third one. The kids are squealing with delight.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Tombstone piledriver!
          
          Randy sees a car drive up and park by the MANAGER'S OFFICE.
          He watches it with interest.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Catch you maniacs later...
          
          The kids moan with disappointment as Randy heads off.
          
          
          INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Randy glares at Len, the trailer park's MANAGER.
          
                              RANDY
                    C'mon, Len. Don't be such a fuckin'
                    ballbreaker.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    You'll get in when I get my rent.
          
                              RANDY
                    You know I'm good for it.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    Sure. You're good for it every time
                    this happens.
          
          Randy sigh-groans in frustration.
          
                              RANDY
                    Can I at least park in back?
          
          Len looks at Randy. A wave of pity comes over him.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    Twenty bucks.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - IN BACK - EVENING
          
          Randy sits on a MILK CRATE by his parked van. On the ground
          in front of him is a BLENDER connected to an extension cord
          stretching to another TRAILER. He pours a protein-shake
          packet into the blender.
          
          The trailer door opens. A WOMAN comes out. Lighting a
          cigarette, she looks up at the cloudless, starry sky.
          
                                                                      6.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks, Meg.
          
          She gives Randy a small "You got it" wave.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. SHOP-RITE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sticks his head in a door marked MANAGER'S OFFICE.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hey, Wayne.
          
          
          INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Sitting behind a desk is store manager WAYNE (40). He looks
          up at Randy, irked.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Do we not know how to knock?
          
          Wayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer.
          
                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Let's try that again.
          
          Randy steps out and closes the door behind him. He knocks.
          
                               WAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Come in!
          
          Randy enters.
          
                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hi, Randy! What can I do for
                    you?
          
          Randy groans privately. He really hates Wayne.
          
                              RANDY
                    Do you have any extra shifts you
                    could throw my way?
          
                              WAYNE
                    What's the matter, they raise the
                    price of tights?
          
                                                                   7.
          
          
          Randy is not amused. Wayne grabs a LOOSELEAF BINDER.
          
                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Let's see what we got.
          
          Wayne starts flipping through.
          
                              RANDY
                    Pretty much anything weekday...

          Randy, working alongside some MEXICAN GUYS, lifts a STACK OF
          BOXES off the back of a BOAR'S HEAD DELIVERY TRUCK.
          
          He carries the boxes through a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN, into a
          WALK-IN COOLER. He puts them down and heads back out again.

          Randy stands with GREGG, a huge bodybuilder who's counting
          off some bills. Randy growls with displeasure at the small,
          liquid-filled GLASS BOTTLE in his hand.
          
          ANGLE ON bottle: The label says SUSTANON 250. The rest of the
          label is in SPANISH.
          
                              GREGG
                    I'm tellin' ya, bro, it's identical
                    to the German.
          
                              RANDY
                    I tried Mexican sus once. Gave me
                    bitch tits.
          
                              GREGG
                    Years ago, right? Mexican's way
                    better now.
          
                              RANDY
                    I don't want this.
          
                              GREGG
                    Bro, it's the same.
          
                              RANDY
                    I want my German.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              GREGG
                    I don't have any.
          
                               RANDY
                    Yeah?
          
          Randy steps in front of Gregg's locker and starts ROOTING
          AROUND.
          
                              GREGG
                    What are you doing?
          
          Randy finds a bottle with GERMAN WRITING on it.
          
                              GREGG (CONT'D)
                    That's my own stash. That's my last
                    one.
          
          Randy puts the bottle of Mexican sustanon in the locker and
          walks off with the German.
          
                              RANDY
                    Danke schoen.

          Randy is BENCHPRESSING. He grunts loudly as he squeezes out
          one more rep, his SPOTTER urging him on.

          Randy is driving along Route 21. "Once Bitten Twice Shy" is
          blasting on the stereo. One hand on the wheel, he bangs out
          the song's piano riff on the dash with the other.
          
          He passes Cheetah's, a STRIP CLUB. He keeps an eye on it as
          he drives past.
          
          The song fades out. He pops the tape out of the deck and
          tosses it on the passenger seat. On it is a messy pile of old
          cassettes. Skid Row. Mötley Crüe. AC/DC. Guns `N' Roses. He
          sifts through the selection, one eye on the road.

                    not least, for the strap, Kid Loco
                    versus Randy The Ram. Got it? Good.

          INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits alone a table toward the back. He takes a roll of
          athletic tape out of his supplies-filled WHEELIE TRAVEL BAG.
          He starts WRAPPING HIS KNEES AND ANKLES. He does it in a
          slow, methodical manner. It feels almost ritualistic.
          
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is hashing out the match with his opponent, a wiry
          Puerto Rican kid whose shiny vinyl pants identify him as KID
          LOCO (22).
          
                              RANDY
                    Right there, you post me. Hard. I
                    show color.
          
          Kid Loco nods, listening closely, deferential to the legend.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You post me again. Again.
                        (Kid Loco nods)
                    You're fuckin' whalin' on my ass.
          
                              LEX LETHAL (O.S.)
                    Ram.
          
          Randy turns and sees fellow wrestler LEX LETHAL sticking his
          head into the cafeteria door.
          
                              LEX LETHAL (CONT'D)
                    There's some chick out here looking
                    for you.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          
                                RANDY
                    Who?
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                        (SHRUGS)
                    Some chick.
          
                                RANDY
                    Ring rat?
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    I don't think so.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Randy emerges from the cafeteria. A look of PLEASED SURPRISE
          comes over his face.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's up, kiddo?
          
          RANDY'S POV: Standing there in an otherwise empty hallway is
          a plain-ish YOUNG WOMAN (22). She looks at him with an
          unsmiling expression. This is STEPHANIE.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Long time no see.
          
          Randy pulls her in for a hug. She doesn't really hug back.
          
          She steps back, breaking off the hug. A brief, awkward pause.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Whatcha doing here? Here to root on
                    your old man?
          
          She shakes her head no.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    That's okay----as long as you're not
                    rooting against me!
          
          She is irked by his jokiness.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Is there someplace we can talk?
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm on in a sec.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    It won't take much of your time.
          
                                                                12.
          
          
                                   RANDY
                    What's up?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I'm here because...
          
          Stephanie gathers herself. This isn't easy for her.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    I came to make amends.
          
                                   RANDY
                    Amends?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I'm supposed to talk to people I've
                    hurt.
          
          Randy is puzzled for a moment. Then, it clicks in.
          
                              RANDY
                    Ohh... 12-stepper.
          
                                   STEPHANIE
                          (NODS)
                    AA.
          
                              RANDY
                    Good for you. That's great.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Thank you. I'm sure you mean that.
          
                                   RANDY
                    I do.
          
          She smile-nods insincerely.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    So's that it?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I need to apologize.
          
                                   RANDY
                    For what?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    For anything I've done or said over
                    the years. All the anger at you.
          
                                   RANDY
                    Okay...
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Like the last time I saw you... I'm
                    sorry for what I said.
          
                              RANDY
                        (dismissive wave)
                    Don't worry about it.
          
          Stephanie is irked by his lack of engagement. She looks at
          him with suspicion.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Do you even know what I said?
          
                              RANDY
                    Sure.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    What did I say?
          
                              RANDY
                    It was about your mom. And me.
                        (vague, flailing)
                    Like, how I was bad.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    You have no idea.
          
                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Raa-am!
          
          Randy turns and sees TWO MEATHEAD FANS down the hall, headed
          his way.
          
                              MEATHEAD #1
                    Whassup, yo? Randy The Ram!
          
          MEATHEAD #1 gives Randy an excited high-five.
          
                              MEATHEAD #2
                    We gonna see some action tonight?
          
                              RANDY
                        (sly grin)
                    Tonight's forecast calls for severe
                    butt-whoopin's with a 100 percent
                    chance of pain.
          
          Psyched "Yeah!"s from the meatheads. Stephanie is pissed at
          the interruption. And, even more, Randy's embrace of it.
          
                              MEATHEAD #1
                    Could we get a picture?
          
                                                                  14.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    No problemo.
          
          The two meatheads flank Randy, their arms around his broad
          shoulders. Meathead #1 looks tentatively at Stephanie,
          holding up his DIGITAL CAMERA.
          
                              MEATHEAD #1
                    Think you could...?
          
          She coldly takes it.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    No problemo.
          
          She looks into the camera. The meatheads stick their tongues
          out and throw up devil signs. Randy flexes theatrically,
          making his best "Aaargh!" wrestling face.
          
          Stephanie snaps a shot. Meathead #1 takes back his camera. He
          and his buddy pat Randy heartily on the back.
          
                              MEATHEAD #1
                    Thanks a lot, yo. Kick some ass out
                    there.
          
                              RANDY
                    You know it, broski!
          
          The meatheads excitedly head off.
          
          Randy turns his attention back to Stephanie, who's glaring at
          him with cold disgust.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    Same shit.
          
                              RANDY
                    They're fans.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Same old shit.
          
                              RANDY
                    I hafta. It's work.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I'm in the middle of saying
                    something important and you drop it
                    for the fucking wrestling.
          
                                                                     15.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    I didn't ask them to come over.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    It's like I'm 10 all over again.
          
                              RANDY
                    Are we almost done with this?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    This what?
          
                              RANDY
                    This ATTACK.
          
          She looks at him calmly. Sadly.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Yeah. We're done.
          
          She walks off.
          
                                                       HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy SMASHING KID LOCO IN THE FACE with a flying drop-kick.
          Kid Loco falls to the canvas.
          
          Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up
          their cheers.
          
          Distracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off
          the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN
          THE HEAD. Randy goes down.
          
          Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest-
          to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.
          
          Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back,
          presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a
          LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams
          down on his back.
          
          As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE
          TURNBUCKLE.
          
          RANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded
          cover.
          
          Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the
          waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. He tucks
          the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm.
          
                                                                     16.
          
          
          Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and
          drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the
          exposed metal post beneath.
          
          Randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade
          along his hairline. No one sees it happen.
          
          BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy's forehead. The crowd's ELECTRIFIED.
          
          Kid Loco slams Randy's head into the metal post again. Again.
          Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts
          around the ring.
          
                              KID LOCO
                    Look at this loser! How pathetic.
          
          ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look
          comes over him, like he's Bruce Banner about to become the
          Hulk.
          
          Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for
          another post smash, but HE CAN'T. Randy's neck and arm
          muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he's suddenly super-
          charged.
          
          A look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is
          about to turn.
          
          Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the
          hair. He pulls him in close.
          
                              RANDY
                        (under breath)
                    Let's go home.
          
          Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage
          he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no.
          
          Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks
          down on Kid Loco's head. Kid Loco's feet fly off the canvas
          as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE
          DOWN with his feet over the ropes.
          
          Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his
          knee into Kid Loco's stomach. Again. Again.
          
          Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes.
          He scurries away. Randy goes after him.
          
          Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he's got. Dropkicks.
          Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.
          
          Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks
          out at the crowd.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
          RANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.
          
                                TRIO
                      Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
          Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads.
          
                                WHOLE CROWD (O.S.)
                      RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
          
          Randy "mulls" it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks
          at the corner. He heads for the corner.
          
          Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd
          like he's still undecided.
          
          RANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation.
          
          Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his
          head like ram's horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening
          montage.)
          
          He LEAPS.
          
          The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down
          onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco's whole body convulses.
          
          The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The
          money shot.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - LATER
          
          Randy, on a post-match high, sits on a cafeteria table
          enjoying a beer as a pseudo-MEDIC stitches up his hairline
          gash. Nick Volpe wanders over.
          
                                MEDIC
                      Ram, man, you popped that crowd.
          
          Randy smiles contentedly. He sure did.
          
                                NICK VOLPE (O.S.)
                      Yo, Ram. Got a sec?
          
          Nick Volpe comes over.
          
                                RANDY
                      For you, needledick? Always.
          
                                NICK VOLPE
                      Do you realize what's coming up?
          
                                                                   18.
          
          
          Randy looks at him, unsure.
          
                                 NICK VOLPE (CONT'D)
                    May 6th...
          
          Randy racks his brains. He has no idea.
          
                              NICK VOLPE (CONT'D)
                    20th anniversary of you and
                    Ayatollah at the Garden.
          
                              RANDY
                        (AMAZED)
                    Holy shit...
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    I know. Time fuckin' flies.
          
          Randy sees an excited smile creep across Volpe's face.
          
                              RANDY
                    Whatcha thinkin'?
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    Two words: Re. Match.
          
          Randy is instantly intrigued.
          
                              NICK VOLPE (CONT'D)
                    I'm doing a big Fanfest thing down
                    in South Carolina that weekend. I
                    wanna main-event it with you two.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Yeah?
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    Ram-Ayatollah II. 20th anniversary.
                    Hundreds, thousands of screaming
                    fans watching you two make history
                    for the second time.
          
                              RANDY
                    Think Bob'd get back in there? He's
                    pretty retired.
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    For this?
                        (cool, confident nod)
                    I bet he'd be willing to dust off
                    the old turban.
          
                                                                  19.
          
          
          Randy's mouth is practically watering.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. CHEETAH'S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A spring in his hobbled step, Randy gets out of the van and
          heads toward Cheetah's, the strip club he passed earlier.
          Manning the door is BIG CHRIS, a huge bouncer/doorman.
          
                              BIG CHRIS
                    Whassup, Ram? How ya been?
          
                              RANDY
                    Yo, Big Chris.
          
          They chummily shake hands. Big Chris pulls Randy in tight.
          
                              BIG CHRIS
                        (into Randy's ear)
                    Hey, can you get me any more of
                    that IGF-1?
          
                              RANDY
                    What do I look like, some fuckin'
                    two-bit street dealer?
          
                              BIG CHRIS
                    C'mon, hook a brother up. You get
                    the family discount.
          
                              RANDY
                    Swing by the mansion. Any day this
                    week.
          
                              BIG CHRIS
                    You da man, Ram!
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          MUSIC: BIRDMAN & LIL WAYNE - "STUNTIN' LIKE MY DADDY"
          
          A crowded, not-very-glamorous Jersey strip club. Randy stands
          over by the bar. The female BARTENDER slides him a beer.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks, hon.
          
          Randy takes a swig, looking around the club.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Cassidy around?
          
                                                                     20.
          
          
                                BARTENDER
                      I think she's VIP-in'.
          
          Randy, nodding, takes his beer and heads over toward the
          STAGE. He settles in at an open table.
          
          
          ON STAGE:
          
          A YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to
          "Stuntin' Like My Daddy", a bass-heavy Dirty South rap song.
          
          
          RANDY:
          
          Randy, watching her, quickly grows bored. He finds the
          stripper, like the song, crude and soulless.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Randy is at the urinal. He flushes and heads over to the
          sink. He washes his hands, checking his look in the mirror.
          He primps a little.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy exits the bathroom and heads back toward the table. En
          route, he passes a curtained-off VIP ROOM.
          
                                WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      Trust me, babe. You're gonna be
                      happy.
          
          Randy, hearing this, slows.
          
                                DUDE #1 (O.S.)
                      We said the other one.
          
                                DUDE #2 (O.S.)
                      The redhead. With the belly chain.
          
          Randy peeks through the curtain. Inside, he sees CASSIDY
          (36), a sexy, tattooed, aging rocker chick in a white spandex
          dress. With her are six hair-gelled, goombah-wannabe BACHELOR-
          PARTY DUDES (early 20s). The BACHELOR is sitting in a chair
          in the middle.
          
                                CASSIDY
                      Sorry, guys, she's on break.
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
                                DUDE #1
                      Well, I'm sorry, but we don't want
                      you.
          
                                DUDE #3
                      How old are you, anyway?
          
                                BACHELOR
                      You're, like, my mom's age.
          
          Stifled laughter from his buddies.
          
          
          OTHER SIDE OF CURTAIN:
          
          Randy's anger builds as he watches.
          
          
          VIP ROOM:
          
          Cassidy, trying to salvage the gig, straddles the bachelor.
          
                                CASSIDY
                      There's nothing like experience.
                          (into his ear, seductive)
                      I've done things your little
                      fiancee's never dreamed of...
          
                                DUDE #2
                      Yeah, like graduate in 1985.
          
          This cracks his friends up. Randy BURSTS THROUGH THE CURTAIN.
          
                                RANDY
                          (to Dude #2)
                      Apologize to this lady.
          
          Everyone is taken aback, including Cassidy.
          
                                DUDE #3
                      Who the hell are you?
          
                                RANDY
                      You speak to her with respect.
          
          Cassidy wedges herself between Randy and Dude #2.
          
                                CASSIDY
                      I got this. It's okay.
          
                                RANDY
                      No, it's not okay. This is
                      definitely not okay.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          He turns to the bachelor.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I guarantee this woman's 50 times
                    hotter than whatever goombah skank
                    you're about to marry.
          
                              DUDE #4
                        (to Dude #1)
                    You hear what he just called Gina?!
          
                              DUDE #1
                    That's my fuckin' sister!
          
          Dude #1 steps to Randy, chest puffed out. Randy whips around
          and GRABS THE CHAIR OUT FROM UNDER THE BACHELOR. He wields it
          menacingly at Dude #1, who backpedals, terrified.
          
          Randy makes like he's going to hit the guy with the chair.
          Instead, he FLINGS IT AT THE WALL.
          
                     DUDE #2                         DUDE #1
          Jesus!!                         What the FUCK!!
          
          The entire bachelor party rushes for the curtain. Just like
          that, they're GONE.
          
          Randy looks at Cassidy, expecting a hearty thank you. Instead
          he gets a PISSED-OFF SHOVE.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Thanks a lot. That was 200 bucks
                    just walked out.
          
          Randy is totally taken aback.
          
                              RANDY
                    I was just trying to help.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    Did I ask for help?
                        (BEAT)
                    Did I need help?
          
          Randy looks down, silent and sheepish.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Then don't fuckin' help.
          
                               RANDY
                    You're right. I'm sorry.
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm sorry.
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          Cassidy calms down a little.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's okay.
          
          She looks at him with a warm smile.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Good to see ya, man.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          MUSIC: KHIA - "MY NECK, MY BACK"
          
          Randy is getting a LAPDANCE from Cassidy. She plants her
          hands against the mirrored wall behind him, her body just
          inches from his face.
          
                              RANDY
                    We're talking one of the historic
                    matches in history. 20,000 people.
                    Another million and a half watching
                    at home on pay-per-view.
          
          She turns, giving him a nice view of her writhing behind. On
          the small of her back is an AC/DC TATTOO.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    We were going back and forth, just
                    killin' each other for a half hour.
                    Any wrestling fan, they know all
                    about it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Million and a half? Shit.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, it was big. So a rematch...
                        (smiles, contemplating the
                         PROSPECT)
                    History all over again.
          
          Cassidy turns around again. Randy looks her body up and down,
          savoring her curves as she dances just for him.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Goddamn you are smokin'.
          
          Cassidy smiles a little. This makes her feel good.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          "My Neck My Back" ENDS. Cassidy pulls back on her dress and
          casually sits down next to him. A new song comes on.
          
          MUSIC: PITBULL - "UNA MANO LAVA LA OTRA"
          
          They look toward the stage, where a PUERTO RICAN STRIPPER
          shakes her ass to the staccato, abrasive Latin rap song.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Who knows. I put on a good show...
          
          Cassidy nods supportively, sincerely.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Could be the thing that gets me
                    back on top.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You never know who's in that crowd.
          
          An ALARMED LOOK comes over Cassidy's face.
          
                                CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Jesus.
          
          Randy follows her eyes to his HAIRLINE.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You're bleeding.
          
          A small amount of BLOOD is trickling down from his stitches.
          He grabs a COCKTAIL NAPKIN and casually dabs it.
          
                              RANDY
                    Got cut tonight.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    You okay?
          
                              RANDY
                    Ah, it's nothing.
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (small chuckle)
                    And they say wrestling's fake.
          
          Randy proudly holds out his arm.
          
                              RANDY
                    How's this for fake?
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: A long-ish SCAR on Randy's bicep.
          
                                                                  25.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                    What's that from?
          
                              RANDY
                    1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob
                    Banjo hit me with his two-by-four.
                    Loose nail tore the bicep open.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Ow. Fuck.
          
                              RANDY
                    I got even better.
          
          He pulls down his shirt collar, revealing a nasty COLLARBONE
          SCAR.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    1988. Orlando Arena. Mr.
                    Magnificent tossed me out of the
                    ring. Landed on my shoulder,
                    clavicle snapped in half.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Doesn't it hurt?
          
                              RANDY
                        (BLISSFUL)
                    Not when they're going crazy for
                    you...
          
          Cassidy stands up and straddles him, gazing soulfully at the
          scar.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    "He was pierced for our
                    transgressions, He was crushed for
                    our iniquities. The punishment that
                    brought us peace was upon Him, and
                    by His wounds we were healed."
          
          Randy contemplates the quote. He likes it.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's that?
          
                               CASSIDY
                    It's from "Passion of the Christ".
                        (BEAT)
                    You never seen it?
          
          Randy shrugs no.
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Dude, you gotta. It's amazing.
          
          She sits down next to him again.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    It's, like, so inspiring. They
                    throw everything at Him. Whips,
                    arrows, rocks... Just beat the
                    living fuck out of Him for the
                    whole two hours. And He just takes
                    it.
          
                              RANDY
                    Huh. I'll have to check it out.
          
          Cassidy lightly traces a finger along Randy's bicep scar.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    The sacrificial Ram...
          
          The Pitbull song ends. A new song begins.
          
          MUSIC: MOTLEY CRUE - "GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS"
          
                                CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Ah, shit.
          
                              CLUB D.J. (O.S.)
                    And now, please welcome to the
                    Cheetah's stage...
          
          Cassidy stands up.
          
                              CLUB D.J. (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    ...the lovely Cassidy!
          
          Randy reaches into a pocket and pulls out some bills.
          
                              RANDY
                    What do I owe?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Just gimme for three.
          
          Randy peels off three $20s and hands them to her.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You'll wait `til I'm done?
          
          Randy just smiles. She gives him a small peck on the cheek
          and heads off.
          
                                                                     27.
          
          
          THE STAGE:
          
          Cassidy BURSTS ONTO THE STAGE. She owns it with rock `n' roll
          energy.
          
          
          ON RANDY:
          
          ANGLE ON Randy's face as he enjoys the dance.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. VAN - DAY
          
          Randy is driving over the Throgs Neck Bridge.
          
          
          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          The van pulls up to a TWO-FAMILY HOUSE in working-class
          Queens. Out steps Lex Lethal (from the Passaic VFW show).
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy heads down a highway entrance ramp, Lex Lethal riding
          shotgun.
          
                                 LEX LETHAL
                       Thanks for the lift, bro.
          
                                 RANDY
                       No prob. You're right on the way.
          
          Randy merges into traffic on the Long Island Expressway.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       So how big's this place?
          
                                  LEX LETHAL
                       Nice. Two, two-fifty...

                           (PLEASED)
                       That place?
          
                                 LEX LETHAL
                       Should get a good gate. DiFusco
                       says he's gotten like 20 calls last
                       two days alone.
          
                                                                  28.
          
          
          Randy chuckles cynically.
          
                              RANDY
                    God bless hardcore...
          
          
          INT. DOLLAR TREE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A Long Island strip-mall 99-CENT STORE. Randy and Lex browse
          an aisle. Randy is holding a TIN CAKE PAN. He bangs it
          against his forehead, testing it out. It makes a LOUD CLANG.
          
                              RANDY
                    Whatcha think?
          
          Lex takes the pan, testing it against his own head.
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    Cookie trays were better.
          
          Lex spots something exciting on another shelf.
          
                              LEX LETHAL (CONT'D)
                    Hell, yeah.
          
          He grabs a pack of STEEL-WOOL PADS. Randy nods in approval.
          Lex tosses them into the SHOPPING BASKET Randy is holding.
          
          ANGLE ON basket. It's full of all sorts of "supplies": cookie
          trays, lightbulbs, thumbtacks, cheese graters, wire hangers,
          cutlery sets, pizza cutters, etc.
          
                              RANDY
                    Let's see if they got extension
                    cords.
          
          They head off in search.

          MUSIC: AC/DC - "IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)"
          
          Randy stands BEHIND A CURTAIN as his entrance song plays. He
          sneaks a peek through it.
          
          RANDY'S POV: A ROWDY CROWD of about 150 fills a COMMUNITY-
          CENTER GYM. The vibe of the crowd is a bit rougher than
          previous events. A banner on the wall reads ECHW - EAST COAST
          HARDCORE WRESTLING. Pressed against the outside of the ring
          are a FOLDING TABLE and a 12-FOOT METAL LADDER.
          
                                                                    29.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          An ANNOUNCER stands with a microphone.
          
                                ANNOUNCER
                      Ladies and gentlemen...
          
          
          BEHIND THE CURTAIN:
          
          Randy stands quiet and peaceful, head lowered slightly.
          
                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                      From Elizabeth, New Jersey,

          THE GYM:
          
          Randy explodes into the gym, full of fire and showmanship.
          
          He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is
          raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a
          set of RAM'S HORNS. Fans do the same.
          
          Kids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He
          obliges as many as he possibly can.
          
          Fans hold out FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. (Just like in
          the opening montage.) He "rams" each one with his forehead.

          He does a lap around the perimeter of the ring,
          enthusiastically head-butting chairs the whole way.

          Randy climbs into the ring. He does a few neck rolls and knee
          bends, limbering up.
          
          The song fades down. A new song rises...

                    pounds...
          
          The boos begin to rain down.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                    Hellbilly Cannibaaaal!
          
          Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge,
          overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to
          his scraggly beard. He's dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK.
          
          A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY
          CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a
          folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where
          Randy awaits.
          
          They sit down on chairs facing each other. Under Hellbilly
          Cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy's is his
          Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly
          Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a
          little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of
          "slaps".
          
          After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his
          sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in
          Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around
          the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head
          with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal
          reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE.
          Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube
          explodes with a pop.
          
          Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward
          Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie
          board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS
          OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent
          jolt as the chair hits the mat.
          
          Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an
          aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the
          face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC
          CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times.
          
                                                                     31.
          
          
          Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster.
          
          He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the
          ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal, bouncing off, ducks Randy's
          awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and
          crashes into Randy knee-first.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his
          face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM
          OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the
          concrete floor.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding
          chair. He WHALES RANDY IN THE FACE with it. Randy stumbles
          backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the
          fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips
          over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an
          exhilarated panic.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs.
          Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere.
          
          Randy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST.
          
          Randy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly
          Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN
          and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square
          in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down.
          
          Randy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal,
          showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head
          into the can and falls on it, ass-first.
          
          Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He
          POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET.
          
          With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to
          his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling
          around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off
          the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair,
          carrying the ladder in his other hand.
          
          Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up
          the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and
          grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He
          reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF
          THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder
          with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the
          table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy
          surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is
          caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy
          grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF.
          
                                                                   32.
          
          
          In mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly
          Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back
          bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet.
          Randy hits him with a dropkick.
          
          Randy's heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out.
          
          Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up
          for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his
          face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat.
          
          Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching
          his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at
          the air.
          
          RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They
          assume it's part of the act.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He
          knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.
          
                              HELLBILLY CANNIBAL
                    Is there a doctor?
          
          Few fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag.
          
          Among those who sense it's real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event's
          promoter. He climbs into the ring. Kneels over Randy.
          
                              JERRY DIFUSCO
                    Randy. You okay?
          
          Randy is gasping. DiFusco turns to Hellbilly Cannibal.
          
                                JERRY DIFUSCO (CONT'D)
                    Call 911.
          
          Lex Lethal and some of the other wrestlers climb into the
          ring. They huddle around Randy.
          
                              JERRY DIFUSCO (CONT'D)
                    Let's get him up.
          
          With no small effort, they lift Randy. They carry him to the
          ropes. They slow, unsure how best to get him through.
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    Put him down.
          
          They lower him to the mat. Lex hops out of the ring and grabs
          Randy's ankles.
          
                                                                    33.
          
          
          Several of the other guys hop out of the ring, supporting
          Randy's underside as they carefully, awkwardly pull him out.
          
          By now, the crowd realizes this is real. They surge forward
          as DiFusco and the wrestlers carry Randy toward the exit.
          
                              JERRY DIFUSCO
                    Get back, get back, get back.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy is carried down a LONG HALLWAY, trailed by curious and
          concerned fans. Lex is closest to Randy's head.
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    You're okay, buddy. Hang on.
          
          They reach a door and enter. The wrestler holding Randy's
          feet shuts it behind them.
          
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy lies on a table, his eyes rolling back in his head. Lex
          squeezes his hand, trying to keep him conscious.
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    Stay with us, bro. Help's coming.
          
          EMS WORKERS come rushing in.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          
          INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Randy lies unconscious. There's a BREATHING TUBE in his mouth
          and ANOTHER TUBE going through his CHEST WALL. He's hooked up
          to a MECHANICAL VENTILATOR.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          
          INT. POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NEXT DAY
          
          Randy lies asleep. The breathing tube is out. The chest tube
          is still in.
          
          His eyes slowly open. He looks around, disoriented. Woozy.
          Confused by all the wires on him, he starts PULLING THINGS
          OFF. Monitors BEEP. Nurses rush into the room, calming him
          down as they try to reattach the wires.
          
                                                                   34.
          
          
          He faints.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S ROOM - NEXT DAY
          
          Randy, transferred to a regular hospital room, is watching
          "All My Children" on the wall-mounted TV. The chest tube is
          out, in its place a large bandage.
          
                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                           (slight Indian accent)
                       Mr. Ramovic.
          
          Randy looks up. DR. TARACHANDANI (40) enters the room.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Call me Randy.
          
          The doctor, nodding, looks down Randy's folder.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       So how we lookin', doc?
          
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                       A lot better than before the
                       bypass.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Great. So I'm all good.
          
          From the doctor's face, it's not quite that simple.
          
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                       Your heart... You're going to have
                       to start taking much better care of
                       it.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Like...
          
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                       For starters, you must take your
                       medication every day.
          
                                 RANDY
                       I could handle that.
          
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                       No smoking.
                           (Randy nods)
                       And no cocaine.
          
                                                          35.
          
          
                              RANDY
                        (defensive, offended)
                    I don't do coke.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    It's all over your blood work.
          
                              RANDY
                        (sheepish, busted)
                    Maybe once in a while.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Well, it has to be never.
          
          Randy gives him a reluctant nod.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)
                    As for exercise, it's still okay,
                    as long as it's moderate.
          
                              RANDY
                    So, like, wrestling...
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Not a good idea.
          
                              RANDY
                    What if I do it moderate? I could
                    hold back on certain moves. There's
                    always ways to fake----
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Mr. Ramovic...
          
                              RANDY
                        (edgy glare)
                    Randy.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Randy, a man with your heart should
                    not be flying around a ring
                    crashing into people.
          
          Randy's nostrils flare.
          
                              RANDY
                    With all due respect, Dr...
                        (reads name tag,
                         MISPRONOUNCING)
                    ...Trachanani, I'd like a second
                    opinion on that.
          
                                                                     36.
          
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Of course. But I promise you, any
                    doctor I showed your file would say
                    the same thing.
          
          Randy lets out a skeptical, sarcastic snort.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)
                    You almost died. The next time, you
                    won't be so lucky.
          
                              RANDY
                    I want a second opinion.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Your heart's been through a lot.
                    Even before the heart attack, it
                    was significantly----
          
                               RANDY
                    I want a second opinion.
                        (BEAT)
                    I WANT A SECOND OPINION.
          
          
          INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS DESK - MORNING
          
          Randy is checking out of the hospital.
          
                              ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN
                    This is your copy.
          
          The ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN hands him some paperwork. He folds
          it up and stuffs it in a pocket.
          
                              ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    This was left for you.
          
          She hands him a plain white ENVELOPE. Randy opens it. Inside
          is a NOTE:
          
          YOU EARNED IT DUDE... YOUR A WARRIOR!
          REST UP, FEEL BETTER.
          ----JERRY DIFUSCO
          PS... IF YOUR UP BY THE 23RD, I GOT SOMETHING IN YONKERS
          
          Randy looks into the envelope again and pulls out $300.
          
          He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It's his biggest
          payday in years. He tucks it in a pocket.
          
                              ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    You have somebody picking you up?
          
                                                                     37.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah.
          
          
          EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day.
          He squints, his eyes adjusting. He stands there looking
          around, a lost animal.
          
          
          EXT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - PARKING LOT - SHORT
          TIME LATER
          
          A CAB pulls up to Randy's van, still parked in the community
          center's lot. Randy steps out of the cab and limps to the
          van. He gets in.
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits in the van in the otherwise empty lot, pondering
          his next move.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. CVS PHARMACY - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy roams an aisle, killing time, idly browsing the
          selection of deodorants.
          
                              WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Robin Ramovic?
          
          Randy looks up. He heads down the aisle, toward the voice. He
          comes to the...
          
          
          PHARMACY COUNTER:
          
          A female PHARMACIST stands holding a small pharmacy bag.
          
                              PHARMACIST
                    Robin Ramovic?
          
          Randy heads toward her.
          
                              PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
                    Is that you?
          
          He gives her a small, embarrassed nod, taking the bag.
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
          INT. PARADISE OAKS - MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATER
          
          Randy hands Len the manager a bunch of cash. Len notices he
          seems a little off.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    You alright?
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Len removes the padlock from Randy's trailer door.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    Welcome home.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A messy, junk-filled trailer. Randy stands at the kitchen
          counter with the CVS bag.
          
          He opens the bag and takes out FOUR PRESCRIPTION PILL
          BOTTLES. We catch a glimpse of the drug names on them:
          PLAVIX. COREG. LIPITOR, LISINOPRIL.
          
          He gazes at the patient name on all of them...
          
          RAMOVIC, ROBIN
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Randy is taking a shower. On his chest is a SURGERY BANDAGE.
          He soaps up, careful not to get the bandage wet.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER
          
          Randy collapses on the bed, exhausted.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Randy lies on the bed, gazing off. Restless. Bored. Something
          catches his eye.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
          RANDY'S POV: On the floor, in front of the TV, is an old
          NINTENDO VIDEOGAME SYSTEM. The game cartridge in the console
          is WRESTLEJAM `88.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sticks his head out of his trailer.
          
          RANDY'S POV: In front of the opposite trailer, ADAM (8), one
          of the kids he was play-wrestling with, is idly throwing a
          tennis ball against a car.
          
                                RANDY
                    Yo, Adam!
          
          Adam turns and looks toward Randy.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Wanna play Nintendo?
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Adam sit on the floor playing WrestleJam `88.
          
          
          ON TV:
          
          Cyber-Randy is wrestling The Ayatollah at a packed Madison
          Square Garden. The graphics are late-'80s crude.
          
          Randy flies all over the ring, devastating his foe with a
          series of acrobatic leaps and kicks and flips.
          
          
          RANDY AND ADAM:
          
          Randy wears a look of intense concentration. Adam makes a
          scrunched-up face at the screen.
          
                              ADAM
                    What's that square?
          
                              RANDY
                    What square?
          
                              ADAM
                    That you're hitting me with.
          
                              RANDY
                    It's a folding chair.
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
                              ADAM
                    That's a chair?
          
                              RANDY
                        (PISSY)
                    Yes, it's a chair.
          
          Randy grunts, annoyed. They play for a stretch in silence.
          
                              ADAM
                    This is old.
          
                              RANDY
                    1988 ain't old.
          
                              ADAM
                    That was, like, 50 years before I
                    was born.
          
                              RANDY
                    Shut up and fight.
          
                              ADAM'S MOM (O.S.)
                        (outside trailer)
                    Ad-aam!
          
          Adam looks toward the window. Randy hits PAUSE.
          
                              ADAM
                    Coming!
          
          Adam turns back to the TV.
          
                              RANDY
                    Ready?
          
          Adam nods yeah. Randy un-pauses. Play resumes.
          
          
          ON TV:
          
          Cyber-Randy drops The Ayatollah with a knee to the chest. And
          another. The Ayatollah GOES DOWN. Randy heads to a corner and
          CLIMBS TO THE TOP ROPE.
          
          He raises his arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his
          fists to the sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM'S HORNS.
          
          Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat
          and crashing down on The Ayatollah horns-first. He pins The
          Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory. The
          crowd goes wild.
          
                                                                     41.
          
          
          RANDY AND ADAM:
          
          Randy does a little celebratory fist pump. He hits RESET.
          
                                 RANDY
                    One more?
          
                              ADAM
                    I gotta go.
          
                               RANDY
                    Don't you wanna get even? I whipped
                    your butt.
          
                              ADAM
                    That's okay.
          
          Adam gets up and scampers out of the trailer.
          
          Randy, suddenly alone, looks at the TV. He gazes at the words
          on the screen:
          
                      1 PLAYER        2 PLAYER
          
          He selects 1 PLAYER.
          
          A new match begins. Randy plays without much enthusiasm.
          After a few halfhearted kicks and punches, he TOSSES THE
          CONTROLLER ASIDE.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a JUMPING
          JACK. He does another. A few more.
          
          He feels himself getting winded. A little woozy. He sits
          down. He sits still, trying to slow his heart.
          
          He starts to CRY.
          
          Angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT
          
          Randy enters the club. It's crowded tonight. He looks around
          for Cassidy. He spots her in a corner offering a CUSTOMER a
          lapdance. The customer passes. She moves on.
          
          Randy heads over. She gives him a friendly little cheek peck.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Hey, sweetie. You're back soon.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Ah, I was just in the neighborhood.
          
          Cassidy nods oh.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                        ("CASUAL")
                    Hey, feel like maybe grabbing a
                    burger?
          
          Cassidy finds the offer a little odd. This isn't how they
          operate.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'm working.
          
                              RANDY
                    How `bout later, then?
          
          She looks at him, puzzled. He seems off.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    You okay?
          
                              RANDY
                    Can we talk for a sec?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Sure. What's up?
          
                              RANDY
                    Someplace more quiet.
          
          Randy glances toward the door. Cassidy, catching his drift,
          looks at him, a little gravely.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Randy, I can't leave with a
                    customer.
          
          Pause.
          
                              RANDY
                    I had a heart attack.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Shit. When?
          
                              RANDY
                    I needed to talk to somebody.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You can't talk here?
          
                                                                   43.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Just a couple minutes.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Randy, I don't do that.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Please.
          
          Cassidy looks at him, torn. She sees the need, the fear in
          his eyes.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Where are you parked?
          
                                 RANDY
                    In back.
          
          Another pause of hesitation from Cassidy. This is big.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Go to your car. I'll meet you out
                    there in 15 minutes.
          
          
          EXT. CHEETAH'S - REAR PARKING LOT - 15 MINUTES LATER
          
          Randy sits in the van, staring at the club's rear EMERGENCY
          EXIT. Cassidy emerges, a jacket covering her dress. Randy
          waves. Spotting him, she comes over, climbing in the
          passenger side.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks. I appreciate it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's okay.
          
          She looks at his vulnerable expression.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry. That's fucked up, dude.
          
          Randy nods.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    When was it?
          
                                 RANDY
                    Last week.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    You okay?
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, yeah. Feelin' much better.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Good, good. What happened?
          
                              RANDY
                    It was while I was wrestling. I
                    collapsed in the ring.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Oh, man. That's terrible.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.
          
          He chuckles, a little perversely.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Tell ya, though, it was a big hit
                    with the fans.
                        (amused grin)
                    Promoter told me everybody was
                    hanging around wondering if I was
                    okay, they wound up buying up all
                    of his T-shirts and shit. Whole
                    merch table got cleaned out.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's funny.
          
          Randy's grin fades. His expression turns melancholy, fearful.
          
                              RANDY
                    Doctor says I can't wrestle no
                    more.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Damn. What are you gonna do?
          
                              RANDY
                    I don't know. I don't know what to
                    do. If I can't wrestle...
          
          He loses himself in some bleak thought.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    It just happened. You don't have to
                    figure everything out this second.
                    Give yourself some time.
          
                               RANDY
                    Time's all I got. I just sit there
                    all day...
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          He stares off bleakly again.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You really shouldn't be alone right
                    now.
          
          He turns to her, looking her in the eye.
          
                              RANDY
                    That's why I came to see you.
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (a little unnerved)
                    Randy...
          
          She looks at him with sympathy.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I feel bad what happened. But you
                    and me... I can't go there.
          
          Randy gives her a sour, disappointed look.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You should be with family now. You
                    have a daughter, right? Where is
                    she?
          
                              RANDY
                    We don't really get along too good.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    It doesn't matter. You need her.
          
                              RANDY
                        (bitter chuckle)
                    She don't need me.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Everybody needs a father. Trust me.
          
          Randy shrugs, not so sure. Cassidy glances at the dashboard
          clock.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry. I gotta get back in.
          
          She puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You take care of yourself.
          
          She gives him a peck on the cheek. He lingers there for a
          second. A weird, tentative moment.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You gonna be okay?
          
          He nods, putting his brave face back on.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken
                    bigger bumps than this.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    I'm sure.
          
                              RANDY
                    Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You should.
          
                              RANDY
                    Why the fuck not? I'm her father. A
                    person only gets one father in this
                    life.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Exactly.
          
                              RANDY
                    Unless you're adopted.
          
          Cassidy laughs. She gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You're gonna be just fine.
          
                              RANDY
                    Definitely.
          
          Cassidy climbs out of the van. Randy watches as she heads
          back into the club.
          
          His cheery expression fades. He is alone again.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Randy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk-filled
          shoebox. He pulls out an OLD PHOTO.
          
          RANDY'S POV: It's a mid-'80s photo of Randy and his infant
          daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree.
          Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing,
          Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep.
          
                                                                  47.
          
          
          He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled
          PHONE NUMBERS. They're all crossed-out except the last one.
          The numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top,
          as if they've been written down over the course of years.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone
          cradled to his ear.
          
                              STEPHANIE'S VOICE
                    This is Stephanie, you know what to
                    do.
                        (answering machine BEEP)
          
          Randy listens to the silence. He hangs up.
          
          
          INT. VAN - LATER
          
          Randy sits in his van by the curb of a modest, lower-middle-
          class house. He looks at the house, working up the nerve to
          approach.
          
          
          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - LATER
          
          Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself,
          he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T-
          SHIRT and PANTIES.
          
                              RANDY
                        (a little thrown)
                    Hey... Is Stephanie home?
          
          The woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is.
          
                              THE WOMAN
                    Who can I say it is?
          
                              RANDY
                    Her father.
          
          She disappears into the house.
          
          A few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung
          over her shoulder. In her hands is a TEXTBOOK. She heads
          straight down the driveway, blowing past Randy.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Where you going?
          
          He goes after her.
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
                                    RANDY (CONT'D)
                       Stephanie!
          
          He catches up. She stops.
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                       What do you want?
          
                                 RANDY
                       Can we talk?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                       Now's really not a good time.
          
          She resumes walking, briskly.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Wait!
                           (chasing after her)
                       Where ya going?
          
          He looks at the textbook in her hands: PRINCIPLES OF CHILD
          DEVELOPMENT.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       You in school? That's great.
          
          She turns DOWN THE SIDEWALK. He continues following.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       What school?
          
          No answer.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       What school?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                       Middlesex County Community.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Middlesex? That's kind of a hike.
                       Where's your car?
                           (no response)
                       You taking the bus? Lemme give you
                       a lift.
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                       That's okay.
          
                                  RANDY
                       It's no problem.
                           (BEAT)
                       Really. I'm parked right by.
          
                                                                  49.
          
          
          Stephanie picks up the pace, trying to lose him.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're walking pretty fast there.
                    You running late?
                        (no answer)
                    I could help you with that.
                        (no answer)
                    Give you a ride.
          
          She keeps right on walking.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    New Jersey Transit sucks!
          
          And walking.
          
                              RANDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    The buses smell like piss!
          
          She fights off an amused smile. She slows a tiny bit.
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is driving Stephanie.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Left at the second stop sign.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yes, ma'am!
          
          Randy drives. He slows at the second stop sign, which is at a
          bigger, FOUR-LANE STREET. He makes the left. They drive for a
          stretch in awkward silence. Randy seems a little nervous.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    You gonna talk?
          
          A pause as Randy gathers his words.
          
                              RANDY
                    There's something I wanted to tell
                    you.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Okay...
          
                               RANDY
                    I had a heart attack.
                        (BEAT)
                    Last week.
          
                                                                    50.
          
          
          He looks at her earnestly.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I wanna try to fix things.
          
          Stephanie sits there in calm silence, processing all of this.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    You are such an asshole.
          
                                 RANDY
                           (taken aback)
                    Why?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Now you wanna fix things. Now that
                    suddenly you're all scared and
                    alone from your heart attack.
          
                              RANDY
                    What? No. It's not like----
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    This is so fuckin' you. You only
                    come around when you need something
                    from somebody, when they can do
                    something for you. Selfish fuck.
                    Good. Be alone.
          
          She suddenly OPENS HER DOOR as the van is moving. She HOPS
          OUT. Randy hits the brakes, alarmed.
          
                              RANDY
                    What are you doing?
          
          Stephanie stumbles and falls. She gets up. Walks off in the
          direction they came from.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Stephanie!
          
          She's gone. He angrily punches the steering wheel.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Randy lies on his bed, gazing off depressedly. On his chest
          is a well-worn DAY PLANNER, open to a marked-up page.
          
          ANGLE ON page. Scribbled in marker in one of the boxes is
          RAHWAY AUTOGRAF SHOW.
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
          INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - MORNING
          
          Randy, standing at a folding table in a gym, unzips a duffel
          bag. He pulls out a stack of 8x10 GLOSSIES of himself. It's a
          high-flying, mid-air Ram Jam photo from the height of his
          '80s glory.
          
          He puts them on the table. Looks around the gym.
          
          RANDY'S POV: He's at an AUTOGRAPH SHOW that hasn't started
          yet. Around the perimeter of the gym, TEN FOLDING TABLES are
          set up. At each one, a BEAT-UP, WORN-OUT OLD WRESTLER is
          laying out his wares----8x10s, old match tapes, etc.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.)
                    Didn't think I'd see you here.
          
          Randy looks up and sees Scott Brumberg, the promoter from the
          beginning. He's wearing the same "BRUMBERG - 44" Mets jersey.
          
                                RANDY
                    Why not?
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    Heard you collapsed at the DiFusco
                    show. Sounded pretty scary.
          
          Randy smiles coyly.
          
                                SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                              RANDY
                    Sold the shit outta that one.
          
                                SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    No way!
          
                              RANDY
                    I gotta give credit. DiFusco came
                    up with the idea. We're setting up
                    an angle for a grudge match.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    Wow... Dude, you are good.
          
          Randy gives a proud "Hey, what can I say?" shrug.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    I was sure I'd have to cancel the
                    minivan.
          
                              RANDY
                    What minivan?
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    The one I rented for Fanfest.
          
          Randy looks at him, surprised.
          
                               SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    Me and a whole gang's driving down.
                    Terry C., Caggiano, Fatback... I am
                    so fuckin' psyched.
                        (BEAT)
                    You see the flyer?
          
          Randy looks at him blankly. Brumberg walks over to a nearby
          table, where there's a stack of BRIGHT-ORANGE FLYERS. (The
          same flyer can be seen scattered around the room on chairs,
          the floor, etc.) He grabs one and brings it back over.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    Volpe gave me an assload to pass
                    out.
          
          He hands it to Brumberg.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    That is gonna be epic.
          
          RANDY'S POV: The flyer.

          RANDY:
          
          Randy nods vaguely at the flyer, his feelings hard to read.
          
                              RANDY
                    Looks great.
          
                                                                  53.
          
          
          Brumberg looks around the room as the wrestlers set up shop.
          
                                SCOTT BRUMBERG
                      Should get a pretty good crowd
                      today.
          
          Randy holds up his hand, wiggling his fingers for Brumberg.
          
                                RANDY
                      I'll start loosening up.
          
          Brumberg walks off. Randy looks at the flyer again. A sour
          expression comes over his face.
          
          
          INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          The signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room,
          drifting from table to table getting autographs and taking
          photos with the motley assortment of washed-up aging
          wrestlers.
          
          
          ON RANDY:
          
          Randy is sitting behind his table, signing one of his 8x10s
          for a FAN. He hands it to the guy, who hands Randy a $5 bill.
          
                                FAN
                      Thanks.
          
                                RANDY
                      You got it, broski.
          
          The fan walks off. Randy tucks the fiver into the FANNY PACK
          he's wearing. There's not much in there, just a meager few
          ones and fives.
          
          Randy zips up the fanny pack. He looks up, ready to sign more
          autographs----just as soon as somebody comes over.
          
          
          INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks
          around the room at the other wrestlers.
          
          RANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline
          homeless. Across from him is a 40-SOMETHING WRESTLER in a
          WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble
          stream of urine trickles into the bag.
          
                                                                     54.
          
          
          Randy looks down at the stack of Randy The Ram 8x10s on the
          table. He gazes numbly at the high-flying image of himself
          from 20 years earlier.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.)
                    Sorry, man.
          
          Randy looks up and sees Brumberg.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    I was sure the turnout'd be bigger.
          
          Randy shrugs resignedly.
          
          
          INT. VAN - LATER
          
          Randy pulls up to his trailer. He sits there with the engine
          idling, staring at his trailer, scared to go in alone. He
          pulls back out again.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          MUSIC - LIL' KIM - "HOW MANY LICKS?"
          
          Cassidy, roaming the room, approaches a CUSTOMER sitting near
          the stafe. She leans in to his ear, her hand on his arm.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Would you like a lapdance, sweetie?
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    That's okay.
          
          Cassidy moves along. She approaches a PAIR OF GUYS. She leans
          in to one of them.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Would you like a lapdance?
          
                              GUY #1
                    Not right now.
          
          She looks toward the other guy. Before she can even ask:
          
                                GUY #2
                    I'm good.
          
          Cassidy heads off, rejected.
          
                                                                   55.
          
          
                                RANDY (O.S.)
                    Hey.
          
          She turns and sees Randy. She's happy to see him after the
          string of no's.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Hey. How ya feeling?
          
                              RANDY
                    Better. Good.
          
          She leads him over to a table. They sit.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    How'd it go with your daughter?
          
                              RANDY
                        (UNCONVINCING)
                    Good. Fine.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Yeah?
          
          Randy dodges her eye contact.
          
                                CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You sure?
          
          Pause.
          
                              RANDY
                    Not too good, actually. She tore me
                    a new asshole.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Shit. That sucks.
          
          He nods dispiritedly.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    It's tough. You can't give up. You
                    gotta keep trying.
          
          Another half-hearted nod. A brief conversational lull.
          
                              RANDY
                    I was thinking about maybe getting
                    her a present.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    That's a great idea!
                        (BEAT)
                    What's she into?
          
                                                               56.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm not sure.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    How old is she?
          
                                 RANDY
                    22, 23?
                        (BEAT)
                    22.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    What kind of music does she like?
          
                              RANDY
                    I don't know.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Is she into books? Cooking?
          
          Randy just looks at her blankly.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    How could you not know? She's your
                    daughter.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm a shitty fuckin' father.
          
          Cassidy, feeling bad, is hit with an urge to help.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    She's 22? Okay...
                        (RIFFING)
                    You should get her some clothes,
                    some kinda clothes... All girls
                    like that.
          
                              RANDY
                    That could work.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    I know the perfect place. This kick-
                    ass little vintage shop in
                    Westfield.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Yeah?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Saturday's the best time to go.
                    That's when they get the new stuff
                    in, all these boxes full of great
                    shit.
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Okay. Cool.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'll write it down.
          
          Cassidy grabs a pen and a cocktail napkin off the bar.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm pretty sure it's on 28.
          
          She scribbles down YESTERDAZE - WESTFIELD. Hands it to him.
          
                              RANDY
                    Good tip. Thanks.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You got it.
          
          Cassidy starts dancing for him, as is their routine. Randy
          doesn't seem into it.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm gonna grab a drink at the bar.
          
          Randy gets up and heads off toward the bar. She watches him
          go, feeling rejected.
          
          Cassidy gets up. CAMERA stays on her face as she does a lap
          around the club. She glances back toward the bar.
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: Randy is sitting at bar.
          
          She scans the room. A CUSTOMER is looking her way. She starts
          to approach. Then, she STOPS. She looks back toward Randy
          again. He's sitting at the bar alone. She heads over to him.
          
          He looks up from his drink.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    That was fast.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Listen...
          
          Cassidy pauses, hesitant. She takes the plunge:
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    How `bout I meet you there
                    Saturday? Help you out.
          
                                RANDY
                    Yeah?
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                        ("CASUAL")
                    I'm actually gonna be running
                    around right in that area anyway,
                    so it's not really a pain.
          
                              RANDY
                    All right. Thanks.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    No problem. You got it.
          
          She gives him a chummy arm tap and walks off.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - MORNING
          
          Randy knocks on Wayne's door.
          
                              WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Yeah?
          
          
          INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Wayne looks up at Randy, mildly annoyed by the disruption. On
          his computer screen is an ONLINE POKER game.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hey, Wayne. Got a sec?
          
                              WAYNE
                    Not really. What?
          
                              RANDY
                    I was wondering if you had
                    something more steady. Full-time.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Only thing I got right now's got
                    weekends.
          
                              RANDY
                    That works.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Isn't that when you sit on other
                    dudes' faces?
          
                              RANDY
                    What is it?
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
                              WAYNE
                    Deli counter.
          
          Randy seems a little hesitant.
          
                              RANDY
                    So, like, working with customers?
          
                               WAYNE
                    All day long, hot horny housewives
                    begging for your meat.
                        (BEAT)
                    And prepared salads.
          
          Randy thinks it over.
          
                              RANDY
                    That's the only thing you got?
          
                              WAYNE
                    At the moment. You interested?
          
          
          EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Randy stands alone in front of YESTERDAZE, a strip-mall
          vintage clothing store. He looks at his watch, almost
          thinking of leaving.
          
                               CASSIDY (O.S.)
                    Hey.
          
          Randy looks up. He seems slightly thrown by what he sees.
          
                               RANDY
                    Hey.
          
          RANDY'S POV: It's his first time seeing Cassidy in street
          clothes and in daylight. She's not wearing makeup, and her
          hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's also a good three
          inches shorter out of her stripper heels.
          
          They shake hands, a bit awkwardly.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I almost didn't recognize you. You
                    look all... clean.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    "Clean"?
          
                              RANDY
                    Like classy.
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Gee, thanks.
          
                               RANDY
                    Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I
                    like it.
                        (BEAT)
                    It's like in "Grease", where she
                    turns into the hot rock `n' roll
                    chick at the end. Except backwards.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Oh-kaay...
          
          Randy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels
          he's used to.
          
                              RANDY
                    So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy
                    or Pam?
          
          She gives the question genuine thought.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Pam.
                        (playful finger wag)
                    But don't get used to it.
          
          
          INT. YESTERDAZE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy follows Cassidy toward the back of the store. He looks
          around, taking in the array of funky `50s/'60s/'70s clothes.
          
                              RANDY
                    This is awesome...
                        (rubs hands together,
                         PSYCHED)
                    We are gonna find something great!
          
          Cassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in
          business mode. They come to the back where, against the wall,
          she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of CARDBOARD BOXES
          bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts,
          pants, etc. She starts sifting through.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Do you know her size?
          
                              RANDY
                    She's kinda skinny, a little
                    shorter than you.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          Cassidy spots a fun, multi-color MINI-SKIRT. She pulls it
          out.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Could you see her in this?
          
                               RANDY
                    Maybe.

                    I'm not sure.
          
          Cassidy tosses it back in. She unearths a Flashdance-style
          SWEATSHIRT.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    What about this?
          
          Randy makes a sour face. She tosses it back.
          
                               CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    So like, what is she? Goth? Punk?
                    Hippie?
                        (BEAT)
                    Preppy? Stoner?
          
          Randy ponders the choices.
          
                              RANDY
                    Not really...
          
          Cassidy lets out a good-natured groan of frustration. Randy
          watches as she continues searching.
          
                                RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Pam?
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Yeah?
          
                              RANDY
                    Thank you very much.
          
          Cassidy looks at him. She can feel his sincere appreciation.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You're welcome.
          
          She returns to searching. Sift, sift, sift, sift...
          
                              RANDY
                    I think she might be a lesbian.
          
                                                                     62.
          
          
          Cassidy stops sifting. She looks up at him.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Does that help?
          
          Cassidy leads Randy by the arm over to the...
          
          
          MEN'S AREA:
          
          Cassidy heads to a RACK OF CLOTHES. She quickly zeroes in on
          a RETRO BOWLING SHIRT. She holds it up to Randy, who makes a
          scrunched-up face.
          
                              RANDY
                    Ah, maybe she's just a friend.
          
          Cassidy puts the bowling shirt back. As she does, something
          catches Randy's eye.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    What's that?
                        (POINTING)
                    The green.
          
          Cassidy holds up the item for Randy.
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (SURPRISED)
                    This?
          
          An excited look comes over Randy's face.
          
                              RANDY
                    It's perfect.
          
          RANDY'S POV: A satin-green ROLLER-DISCO JACKET. Embroidered
          on the left breast is a big "S" in purple script. It's UGLY.
          
          Cassidy looks at the jacket. She clearly finds it awful.
          
          She looks at Randy, who's beaming with excitement and pride.
          She finds it very endearing.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    I agree.
          
          
          EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Yesterdaze bag in hand, Randy opens the door to his van. He
          and tosses the bag inside. He's on a post-shop high, mission
          accomplished.
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks again.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You found it.
          
                              RANDY
                    I never woulda known about this
                    place.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Okay, I'll give you that.
          
          A tentative pause. Cassidy looks at him, ready to part ways.
          
                                 CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Look, I...
          
                              RANDY
                    Man, I worked up a pretty good
                    thirst in there. What say we grab a
                    beer?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I gotta get going.
          
                              RANDY
                    One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!
          
          Cassidy seems torn.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    I really can't.
                        (BEAT)
                    I got a kid at home.
          
                              RANDY
                    You have a kid?
          
          Cassidy nods. Yup.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I had no idea.
          
          Cassidy shrugs casually.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Boy or girl?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Boy. Daniel.
          
                                 RANDY
                    How old?
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Nine.
          
                              RANDY
                    Wow... I had no friggin' idea.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    It's not something I usually tell
                    customers. Not exactly a turn-on.
          
          Randy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him.
          
                                RANDY
                    Wait.
          
          He unlocks the door. Leaning into the van, he TEARS THE RANDY
          THE RAM ACTION FIGURE OFF THE DASHBOARD. He proudly,
          excitedly holds it out to Cassidy.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Now both our kids got something.
          
          She looks at the action figure, reluctant to take it.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're gonna turn this down, too?
                    Man, you're rough!
          
          Cassidy chuckles a little. She takes it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's very nice of you. Thank you.
          
                              RANDY
                    Tell him to take good care of that.
                    $300 bucks on eBay.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Really?
          
                                RANDY
                    Nah.
          
          Cassidy laughs a little. She can't help but be charmed by his
          sweetness and earnestness. After a pause...
          
                                CASSIDY
                    One beer.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
          INT. LOCAL BAR - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Cassidy are having beers at the bar. He's holding
          her CELLPHONE, looking at PICTURES of her son. He moves on to
          the next one.
          
                              RANDY
                    He's a good-lookin' kid.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I think so.
          
                              RANDY
                    I see where he gets it from.
          
          Cassidy smiles, flattered.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    He sure doesn't get it from his
                    douchebag father.
          
          Randy skips to the next pic. It's a shot of an UNDER-
          CONSTRUCTION CONDO BUILDING.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's that?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Just this condo thing, down by
                    Trenton.
          
                              RANDY
                    You moving there?
          
                               CASSIDY
                    Working on it.
                        (BEAT)
                    It's a great area. Way cheaper. And
                    the schools are awesome.
          
                              RANDY
                    What about Cheetah's?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'm done. I'm quitting.
          
                                RANDY
                          (a little disappointed)
                    Oh.
                        (nods to self)
                    Okay...
          
          MUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - "POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME"
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
          Randy's ears perk up at the song on the jukebox.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Hell, yeah.
          
          He stands up, reaching out for Cassidy's hand. She doesn't
          give it.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon. Let's dance.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Where?
          
                              RANDY
                    Right here.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    This isn't a dance place.
          
                              RANDY
                    Who cares? Fuckin' Def Lep!
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (CHUCKLES)
                    I've danced to this plenty.
          
                              RANDY
                    Fine. Then I'm dancing for you.
          
          Randy starts DANCING in front of Cassidy, who's sitting on a
          barstool. She smiles.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Is this a lapdance I'm getting?
          
          Randy goes into lapdance mode, "seductively" writhing for
          her, silly and self-aware.
          
                              RANDY
                    Just sit back and enjoy.
          
          He turns around, wiggling his ass a little for her. He runs
          his hands up and down her sides. He drapes his long blond
          mane over her shoulders, running it over her face. She
          laughs, charmed and amused.
          
          He gazes into her eyes intensely.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    The lapdancer has become the
                    lapdanced.
          
          Cassidy laughs. He continues dancing, totally unembarrassed.
          
                                                                     67.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I think we can get you a shift.
          
          Randy bobs his head along to the kick-ass Def Leppard tune,
          really loving it.
          
          The song builds to its chorus. Randy SINGS ALONG.
          
                              RANDY
                    Take a bottle, shake it up/ Break
                    the bubble, break it u-up...
                        (CHORUS)
                    Pour some sugar on me! In the name
                    of love!
          
          Cassidy, unable to resist the call of the Lep, joins in.
          
                              CASSIDY AND RANDY
                    Pour some sugar on me! C'mon fire
                    me up!
                        (pointing at each other)
                    Pour your sugar on me! I can't get
                    enough...
                        (eye contact, sultry)
                    I'm hot, sticky sweet/ From my head
                    to my feet yeah...
          
          From here, the song veers off into a GUITAR PART. Randy nods
          along, savoring the awesome hair-metal riffing.
          
                              RANDY
                    They don't make `em like they used
                    to.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Fuckin' eighties, man. Best shit
                    ever.
          
                              RANDY
                    Def Lep, Gunners...
          
                              CASSIDY
                    The Crüe...
          
                              RANDY
                    Then that Cobain pussy had to come
                    around and ruin it all.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Like there's something wrong with
                    having a good time.
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
                               RANDY
                    Fuckin' mopey douchebag.
                        (BEAT)
                    "Ooh, look at me! I wear flannel!
                    I'm all depressed!"
          
                              CASSIDY
                    "I'm from Seattle! I like rain!"
          
          Randy shakes his head sourly.
          
                              RANDY
                    Nineties fuckin' sucked.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    No shit...
          
          Their EYES MEET. A moment of CHEMISTRY. Mutual attraction.
          
          Randy moves closer, his eyes locked on hers. He leans in
          for... a KISS.
          
          They MAKE OUT for a few seconds. Cassidy PULLS BACK.
          
          She gives Randy a playfully scolding FINGER WAG, masking her
          fear and discomfort with what just happened.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    No contact with the customers.
          
                              RANDY
                    You're right. My bad.
          
          He keeps right on dancing, totally unaware of the shift that
          just occurred in her.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Shit.
          
                                 RANDY
                    What's up?
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (glancing at watch)
                    I totally didn't realize the time.
          
                              RANDY
                    We just got here.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I should get home.
          
          She stands up. Randy is very disappointed.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    C'mon. You said one beer!
          
          Randy points toward her ALMOST-FULL BEER on the bar. She
          picks it up and CHUGS the whole thing. She slaps the empty
          bottle on the bar.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Good night.
          
          She gives him an arm pat and walks out of the bar. Randy is
          impressed.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - EMPLOYEE ROOM - MORNING
          
          It's Randy's first day of work. He slips into a DELI COAT.
          Tucks his hair into a hairnet. Pulls a Shop-Rite baseball cap
          over the hairnet.
          
          He walks over to a mirror to see how he looks in his new
          uniform. He feels a little silly.
          
                              WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Here ya go.
          
          He turns and sees Wayne, who hands him something. Randy looks
          at the item in his hand, vaguely bothered.
          
                              RANDY
                    I thought it was gonna say Randy.
          
          ANGLE ON item, a Shop-Rite NAME TAG. The name on it is ROBIN.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Guess they got it off your W-4.
          
                              RANDY
                    Do I really even need to wear one?
          
                              WAYNE
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    Are you gonna be interacting with
                    our valued Shop-Rite customers?
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, but I----
          
                                WAYNE
                    Then yes.
          
                                                                     70.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Could they maybe re-do it?
          
                              WAYNE
                    Just wear the fucking thing.
          
          Wayne walks off. Randy pins the name tag to his apron. He
          takes another look in the mirror, sighing unhappily.
          
          Randy looks up at the employee-room clock. It's 8:59 AM.
          
          He heads toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli
          counter. Standing before the curtain, he pauses a moment,
          gathering himself like before a wrestling match.
          
          He steps through. Showtime.
          
          
          INT. DELI COUNTER - DAY
          
          About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the deli counter with
          Take-A-Number tickets.
          
          Randy, manning the counter, hands an OLD GUY in a WWII
          VETERAN baseball cap a packet of roast beef. The guy shuffles
          off. Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Seventeen.
          
          A WOMAN (60s) steps forward holding a 17 and a SHOP-RITE
          CIRCULAR. She carefully surveys the TURKEY-BREAST SELECTION
          in the case.
          
                              WOMAN
                    The Hudson Acres, are they all on
                    sale or just the regular?
          
          Randy looks clueless.
          
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        (holding up circular)
                    It's a little unclear.
          
          She hands the circular to Randy to take a look.
          
          RANDY'S POV: It says HUDSON ACRES TURKEY BREAST - $5.99/LB.
          
          He still has no idea.
          
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    I'd prefer the maple-glazed, but if
                    it's full price...
          
                                                                     71.
          
          
          Randy briefly catches eyes with another customer, a BIG-
          HAIRED, SEMI-HOT PARTY CHICK in her forties. The kind of
          woman Randy would hit on in a bar. He dodges her eye contact,
          embarrassed by the context.
          
                              RANDY
                        (to circular lady)
                    Hang on, let me...
          
          Randy picks up a phone behind the counter.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                        (into phone, over
                         SPEAKERS)
                    Wayne, please come to the deli
                    counter.
          
          He cringes a bit as his voice booms over the store speakers.
          He hangs up and returns to the customer.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    It'll just be a minute.
          
          The woman, nodding, looks into the deli case again.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Which in your opinion is the best
                    smoked ham?
          
                              RANDY
                    I guess it depends what you like.
          
                               WOMAN
                    I tried the Apple Valley Farms
                    once, and it was very salty. Do you
                    find that?
          
          Randy steals a self-conscious glance at the party chick.
          
          
          INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER
          
          ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 46.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Forty-six.
          
          A WOMAN (35) in workout clothes steps forward with a 46.
          
                              WORKOUT WOMAN
                    Could I get a half-pound of the
                    pesto pasta salad?
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Sure.
          
          Randy grabs a plastic container.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Pesto change-o.
          
          The woman smiles at Randy's little offhand pasta pun. This
          pleases him.
          
          Randy scoops pesto pasta salad into the container. He puts
          the container onto the scale. It reads .51 LB.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Wow. I am good.
          
          This gets Randy a small chuckle from the woman. Randy slaps a
          price tag on the container.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Can I get you anything else?
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Nope. That's it.
          
          He hands her the container.
          
                              RANDY
                    You have yourself a nice day.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                        (friendly smile)
                    I will. You, too.
          
          The woman heads off. Randy's spirits are lifted by the
          exchange.
          
          
          INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER
          
          Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign: NOW SERVING: 57.
          
                              RANDY
                    O-57.
          
          A HOUSEWIFE-TYPE steps forward with the number.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Bingo!
          
          The housewife smiles.
          
                                                                   73.
          
          
                              HOUSEWIFE
                    What's my prize?
          
                              RANDY
                    Anything in the case, sweetheart.
          
                              HOUSEWIFE
                    A pound of chopped liver and a half
                    a pound of egg salad.
          
                              RANDY
                    I think that can be arranged...
          
          He grabs a plastic container and throws it in the air,
          catching it behind his back.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. MIDDLESEX COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE - DAY
          
          Stephanie emerges from the Middlesex County Community College
          building. A look of surprise comes over her face.
          
          STEPHANIE'S POV: Randy is standing there waiting for her by
          his van. Under his arm is a LUMPILY WRAPPED PRESENT, no box.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    What are you, stalking me?
          
                              RANDY
                    Do stalkers bring presents?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    Sometimes.
          
                              RANDY
                    Well, I ain't a stalker. But...
          
          He excitedly hands her the present. She looks at it warily.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Open it.
          
          She opens it. Inside is the green satin jacket. She holds it
          up, trying to process.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    The "S" is for "Stephanie".
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    Oh. Okay.
          
          She looks at the jacket. It's nothing she would ever wear.
          
                                                          74.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    I got it just for you.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I see that. What's it for?
          
                              RANDY
                    No reason. Just because. Do you
                    like it?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I do. It's... shiny.
          
          She looks at Randy. He is excited and proud.
          
                              RANDY
                    I was looking in this store and saw
                    it, and I just said, "That is it."
          
          Stephanie nods, smiling politely.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    So what are you doing now?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    What am I doing?
          
                              RANDY
                    Got any time? I was thinking we
                    could swing by our old favorite
                    spot.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    We have an old favorite spot?
          
                              RANDY
                    You'll remember when you see.
                    Whaddaya say?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Now's not the best time. I've got
                    some things to do.
          
                              RANDY
                    What kinda things?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Stuff.
          
                               RANDY
                    You ain't got stuff!
                        (BEAT)
                    C'mon, give an old man a break.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
          He giver her his biggest, most charming puppy-dog smile.
          
          
          EXT. POINT PLEASANT BOARDWALK - LATER
          
          Randy and Stephanie walk along the boardwalk. It's a charming
          little Jersey-shore boardwalk/beach lined with Skee-Ball
          games, ice-cream parlors, T-shirt shops etc. It's a bit cold
          and not very crowded, still out of season.
          
                              RANDY
                    You really don't remember?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    No.
          
                              RANDY
                    Guess you were pretty young.
          
          They walk for a stretch in silence. He points to a spot.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    There used to be this funhouse.
                        (BEAT)
                    The Monster Motel...
          
          Randy chuckles at the memory.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    They had this cheesy-ass skeleton
                    that popped out of a coffin. You'd
                    get so scared, you'd cry. Then
                    you'd beg to go in again.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                        (chuckles to self)
                    Always was a glutton for
                    punishment.
          
                              RANDY
                    You'd hop on my foot and wrap your
                    arms around my leg. I'd have to
                    walk you the whole way through like
                    that.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I totally don't remember.
          
                              RANDY
                        (looks at her sweetly)
                    I do.
          
                                                                  76.
          
          
          EXT. BOARDWALK - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Stephanie sit on a bench facing the ocean eating
          mint-chocolate chip ice-cream cones. Randy is quiet and
          contemplative, not in his usual "on" mode. He takes a deep
          breath.
          
                              RANDY
                    I accept your apology.
          
          She shoots him an irked look.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Not like that. I just mean... You
                    made amends. I free you.
          
          Her expression softens.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Anything you've ever done or said
                    or thought, I forgive. You've done
                    nothing wrong to me. And anything
                    I've ever done...
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm sorry. Truly.
          
          Stephanie is surprised by his emotion and sincerity.
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    Thank you.
          
                              RANDY
                    I was young. My career was booming.
                    All those lights, the fans, the
                    crazy shit on the road... I wasn't
                    thinking about my kid. Or my wife.
          
          Stephanie nods.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    My priorities were all fucked up. I
                    know that. But now... I wanna try
                    to make things right. I wanna try
                    to get to know you.
                        (lump in throat)
                    I just hope it's not too late.
          
          Randy gazes off at the ocean, filled with fear and love and
          regret. A tear starts to gather in his eye. He wipes it away
          before it has a chance to form.
          
          Stephanie looks at him, moved.
          
                                                                     77.
          
          
          INT. BOARDWALK ARCADE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Stephanie play Skee-Ball side-by-side, father and
          daughter.
          
          
          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy stands with Stephanie in front of her house, dropping
          her off.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hope that wasn't too painful.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    It was okay.
          
                              RANDY
                    Well...
          
          Randy, unsure what to do, extends his hand.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Bye.
          
          They shake. He pulls her in for a brief, mechanical hug.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Bye.
          
          Another pause.
          
                              RANDY
                    So... How about dinner sometime?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Dinner?
          
                              RANDY
                    Maybe Tuesday?
          
          Stephanie thinks it over.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I'm sorry. I don't think so.
          
                              RANDY
                        (nodding, "casual")
                    Or not. That's cool, whatever...
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Wednesday would work better.
          
          Randy is surprised and happy.
          
                                                                  78.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER
          
          Randy sticks the old Christmas photo of Stephanie and himself
          on the fridge.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - DAY
          
          Randy stands at the pay phone, ringing phone to his ear. In
          his hands is his day planner, open to a page marked up with
          upcoming gigs.
          
                               RANDY
                    Yo, Miggy. Ram. How ya doin'?

                        (momentous pause)
                    I'm retiring.
          
          
          EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Another call.
          
                               RANDY
                    Hey, how ya doin', Frank?
                        (BEAT)
                    Good, good. Listen...
          
          
          EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Another call. Randy is holding the Fanfest flyer.
          
                               RANDY
                    Sorry, Volp. You know I'd kill to
                    do it.
                        (BEAT)
                    I realize. I understand.

                    No more. I'm done. I'm retired.
                        (BEAT)
                    Positive. It's time to move on.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT
          
          MUSIC: WARRANT - "CHERRY PIE"
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          Cassidy is up on stage, doing her thing for a sizable crowd.
          She slinks up to a customer who's holding out a dollar bill
          for her. She pulls on her G-string band, snapping it shut on
          the bill.
          
          She moves over to another customer holding out a dollar and
          does the same.
          
                              RANDY (O.S.)
                    Hey. Over here.
          
          She looks toward the voice, coming from another side of the
          stage.
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: Standing there is Randy, holding out a PURPLE
          ENVELOPE. He looks toward her G-string, like he wants to put
          it in like a dollar bill.
          
          She takes it with her hand instead.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Cassidy sit together at a table. Cassidy is holding
          the purple envelope, looking a little uncomfortable.
          
                               RANDY
                    Open it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'll do it later when it's quiet.
          
                              RANDY
                    I wanna watch.
          
          Reluctantly, Cassidy opens it. Inside is a GREETING CARD.
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: On the card's front, a cartoon monkey is
          holding a big bunch of bananas. Across the top, it says
          THANKS A BUNCH!
          
          Randy watches excitedly as she reads the inside. She puts the
          it down after reading it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's very sweet. Thank you.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thank you. I couldn't've done it
                    without you.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'm glad I could help.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    It was fun, right? We had a good
                    time.
          
          She nods politely, reservedly, clearly trying to pull back.

                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you ever been to Mother
                    Kelly's?
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    On 46?
          
                              RANDY
                    They got this kick-ass cover band
                    Tuesday nights. Play anything you
                    can think of. What do you say we----
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Randy.
          
                                 RANDY
                    What?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I can't do this.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Do what?
          
                              CASSIDY
                        ("you and me" gesture)
                    This.
          
          Randy is confused and disappointed.
          
                              RANDY
                    I thought we had a little something
                    going here.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    I think you're awesome. You're a
                    great guy.
          
                                 RANDY
                    But...
          
                                                          81.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You think I'm, like, this stripper,
                    but I'm not. I'm a mom, with
                    responsibilities. I don't think you
                    wanna get with that.
          
                              RANDY
                    What if I do?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I can't go there.
          
                              RANDY
                    What about the other day?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That was a mistake.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Why? How?
          
                               CASSIDY
                    The club and the real world, they
                    can't mix.
          
                              RANDY
                    What if we'd met someplace else?
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    We didn't.
          
                              RANDY
                    But what if we did?
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    We didn't.
          
                              RANDY
                    What if we did?
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    We didn't.
          
                              RANDY
                    You say I don't know you, but you
                    won't let me get to know you.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You're a customer. You're just a
                    fucking customer. That's it. Okay?
                    Got it?
          
          A long, wounded pause from Randy.
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
                                 RANDY
                    Yeah.
                        (BEAT)
                    I got it.
          
          He takes a $20 out of his pocket, holding it out to her.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    What's that for?
          
                              RANDY
                    A lapdance.
          
          He slides it across the bar to her. She slides it back.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're refusing a customer?
          
          He slides the $20 back to her.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Gimme a lapdance.
          
          She slides it back again.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    What? Am I a customer or not?
          
          He waves the $20 tauntingly in her face. She pushes it away.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Stop it.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's the matter?
                        (no answer)
                    Not in the mood?
                        (no answer)
                    So fake it. I'm just a stupid
                    customer.
          
          He tauntingly dangles the $20 in front of her again.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Stop.
          
                              RANDY
                    It doesn't mean anything.
          
          She looks away, trying to ignore him.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, give the customer a
                    lapdance. Shake your tits. Smile.
          
                                                                     83.
          
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Fuck off.
          
                              RANDY
                    Pretend you like him.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Fuck off.
          
                              RANDY
                    I want a lapdance.
          
          She SWATS HIS HAND. The $20 falls to the floor. He picks it
          up and SLAMS IT on the bar.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I WANT A LAPDANCE!
          
          People turn and stare. Randy storms out of the club,
          humiliated.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY
          
          About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the DELI COUNTER
          clutching Take-A-Number tickets. Randy, manning the counter
          with a COWORKER, hands a WOMAN a packet of roast beef.
          
                              RANDY
                    Can I help who's next?
          
          An OLD LADY steps forward.
          
                              OLD LADY
                    Pound of German potato salad,
                    please.
          
          Randy grabs a container and starts scooping potato salad. He
          puts the container on the scale. It reads 1.06 LB.
          
                              OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                    A little less.
          
          Randy scoops out a little and weighs it again. The scale
          reads .96 LB.
          
                              OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                    A little more.
          
          Randy puts a little more in. The scale reads 1.03.
          
                                                                   84.
          
          
                              OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                    A little less.
          
          Randy, trying to contain his aggravation, takes a tiny bit
          out. The scale reads 1.00. The lady nods in approval.
          
          Randy slaps a price sticker on the container and hands it
          across the counter.
          
                              RANDY
                    Have a nice day.
          
          She shuffles off with her potato salad.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Can I help who's next?
          
          A BLUE-COLLAR GUY (40s) steps forward.
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    Yeah, could I get a...
          
          The guy does a DOUBLE-TAKE, noticing Randy's face.
          
                              CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                    Do I know you from somewhere?
          
                              RANDY
                    I don't think so.
          
          The guy studies Randy's face, trying hard to place it.
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    You look so damn familiar.
                        (racking his brain)
                    You Teamsters?
          
                              RANDY
                    Sorry, man. What can I getcha?
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    Half pound of Virginia ham and a
                    half pound of the Jarlsberg.
          
          Randy reaches into the case and pulls out a ham. He brings it
          over to the slicer, his back turned away from the guy.
          
                              CUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    I know we've met someplace.
          
          Slice, slice, slice, slice...
          
                              CUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    You play softball?
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Nah.
          
          Slice, slice, slice, slice...
          
                              CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                    You're not one of Mikey Bosch's
                    buddies, are you?
          
          Randy, shaking his head no, brings the sliced ham over to the
          weigh scale. The guy SNAPS HIS FINGERS.
          
                              CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                    Wait a sec.
          
          He looks at Randy, surprised and amazed.
          
                              CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                    Randy The Ram?
          
          Randy stands there frozen.
          
                              RANDY
                    Huh?
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    The old wrestler. From the '80s.
          
          Randy, shrugging blankly, wraps up the ham and slaps a price
          sticker on.
          
                              CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                        (forms Ram horns)
                    Ram Jam!
          
          Randy grabs the Jarlsberg from the case and brings it over to
          the slicer. He starts slicing.
          
                              CUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Wow, that's freaky. You look just
                    like the dude. Except older.
          
          ANGLE ON the block of cheese as Randy slices. There's only a
          SMALL CHUNK left. The chunk dwindles, getting smaller and
          smaller. The cheese separating Randy's fingers from the blade
          grows thin.
          
          He almost seems tempted.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATE NIGHT
          
          Randy, unable to sleep, sits shirtless on the couch, staring
          blankly at the TV.
          
          
          ON TV:
          
          An NBA HIGHLIGHT CLIP of a FEROCIOUS DUNK. The crowd goes
          wild. The player roars as he runs back up court, full of
          macho swagger.
          
          
          RANDY:
          
          Randy's eyes drift downward toward his chest. He gazes at the
          still-fresh scar. Touches it tenderly.
          
          He takes a big swig of wine, polishing off a bottle. He pops
          a cassette into the BOOMBOX on the floor. GUNS `N' ROSES -
          USE YOUR ILLUSION II.
          
          Randy cranks up the volume and hits PLAY...
          
          MUSIC: GUNS `N' ROSES - "GET IN THE RING"
          
          The song begins with the sound of a ROARING STADIUM CROWD. A
          chant begins:
          
                              CROWD (ON THE SONG)
                    Guns! And! Roses!... Guns! And!
                    Roses!...
          
          Randy starts to prowl the floor like it's a wrestling ring
          before a match. He waves his arms, exhorting the crowd on the
          song as if their cheers are for him.
          
                              RANDY
                        (cups hand to ear)
                    What's that?
          
          Randy works the crowd. He points at a fan in the back row.
          Flexes theatrically. Bangs his head on pretend chairs.
          
          Randy grabs the top rope and gives it a hard shake. Loosening
          up with some neck rolls and trunk twists, he heads to the
          center of the ring.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                        (ANNOUNCER-LIKE)
                    Folks, we are ready to rumble...
          
          The song, which starts with a slow, bluesy guitar intro,
          kicks in. FAST, RAGING HARD ROCK.
          
                                                                     87.
          
          
          Randy stares down his invisible opponent. The opponent SUCKER
          PUNCHES him. Randy drops to the ground.
          
          Randy lies on the floor getting kicked and punched. He knocks
          his opponent down with a LEG SWEEP and pops up.
          
          Randy hits his opponent with a flurry of backhand chops.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I've never seen such determination!
          
          Randy immobilizes his opponent in some sort of headlock.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Sleeper claw!
          
          Randy flips his opponent upside down, his head between his
          knees. He drops him headfirst onto the bed/mat.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Piledriver!
                        (BEAT)
                    Just listen to this place!
          
          Randy scoops up his opponent again and SLAMS HIM TO THE MAT
          with another fancy move.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Powerbomb!
          
          The song reaches its frenzied, chant-like CHORUS:
          
                              GUNS `N' ROSES
                    Get in the ring! Get in the ring!
                    Get in the ring! Get in the ring!
          
          Randy joins in, pumping his fist.
          
                              RANDY
                    Get in the ring! Get in the ring!
                    Get in the ring! Get in the ring!

          A strip-mall sports-card/comic-book shop. Tacked to the wall
          by the entrance are FLYERS for various events----card shows,
          autograph signings, etc.
          
          Behind the counter is promoter Scott Brumberg, scarfing down
          a sloppy Subway sub. The door opens. He looks up, smiling.
          
                                                                    88.

                    Ram!
          
          Randy heads over and gives him a warm hello handclasp.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yo, Brummy.
          
          Brumberg pulls him in for a hug.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    How's tricks? Good to see ya, man.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, good, good.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    So what brings ya by?
          
                              RANDY
                    Well... I was thinking about maybe
                    doing a reffing gig.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    I thought you're retired.
          
                              RANDY
                    No wrestling, just reffing. Thought
                    it might be fun. Shits `n' giggles.
          
          Brumberg, nodding, reaches down and grabs out a beat-up
          SPIRAL NOTEBOOK with old event flyers sticking out.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG

          INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LATER
          
          A high-school cafeteria. Randy is slipping into a REFEREE
          UNIFORM. Along the wall hangs a vinyl banner reading CAPW -
          CONNECTICUT ALL-PRO WRESTLING.
          
                              BOOKER D (O.S.)
                    Randy The Ref!
          
          Randy looks up and sees BOOKER D (30s), a big, black wrestler
          in FULL PIMP REGALIA. Though not a pro like Randy, he's upper-
          tier indie circuit. Randy gives him a grin and handshake.
          
                                 RANDY
                    `Sup, bro?
          
                                                                      89.
          
          
                                BOOKER D
                      Me and McPride was going over
                      spots. We got this dope idea how to
                      work you in.
          
                                RANDY
                      I really ain't lookin' to mix it up
                      tonight.
          
                                BOOKER D
                      You're gonna love this. Check it
                      out. So McPride----
          
                                RANDY
                      That's okay. You guys do your
                      thing.
          
          Booker D looks at him, surprised and puzzled.
          
                                                            HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH H.S. - GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Booker D lands on opponent SHAWN MCPRIDE with a BIG SUPLEX.
          He falls on top of McPride for the pin. Randy The Ref smacks
          the mat, counting.
          
                                RANDY
                      One!... Two!...
          
          McPride kicks out. Booker D lifts up McPride. He hits him
          with a CHEST CHOP, sending him stumbling backwards into the
          ropes. Booker D goes after him.
          
          CAMERA STAYS ON RANDY'S FACE as he watches them wrestle off-
          screen.
          
          Randy's eyes are glued to the action... Punches. Kicks.
          Suplexes. Bodyslams. The crowd is going crazy.
          
          He is tempted. Salivating almost.
          
          More punches. More cheers. Bodies crash loudly against the
          mat. Randy's temptation grows with each shot. He can't resist
          any longer. He...
          
          JUMPS IN.
          
          Randy pushes Booker D out of the way. He's SMASHED IN THE
          FACE by a McPride-swung folding chair meant for Booker D.
          
                                                                     90.
          
          
          Randy goes down. A TRACE OF A SMILE is visible on his face.

                    What a screwjob.
          
                              SHAWN MCPRIDE
                    Crowd was pissed.
          
          McPride gives Randy a "We're not worthy" bow of respect.

                    Just reffing, my ass. I knew you'd
                    get in there.
          
          Randy gives him a "Hey, what can I say?" shrug.
          
                              SHAWN MCPRIDE
                    Y'all feel like grabbing a drink?
          
          McPride and Booker D both look toward Randy. He's the one
          they're interested in hanging with.

          A hotel bar, lively and hopping with a weekend crowd. Randy
          sits at the bar, holding court with Booker D and McPride.
          They're all well on their way to being drunk.
          
                              RANDY
                    By the time Ruckus fixes the tire,

                    Swear to God. Can't make stuff like

                    You never heard that one?
          
          McPride looks at him blankly.

                    shaving when behind me the stall
                    door opens. I turn and there's
                    Chris Columbo on the can taking a
                    dump. He goes, "This is for
                    Petrov", fuckin' wipes his ass,
                    takes the shit-covered toilet paper
                    and rubs it in his armpit. Five
                    minutes later, he's in the ring
                    with Petrov in a headlock, poor
                    Petrov stuck there in CC's pit
                    lookin' like he's gonna puke!

          Booker D spots something intriguing by the bar entrance.
          Randy and McPride follow his gaze there.
          
          RANDY'S POV: TWO WOMEN----late 30s, frosted hair, tight denim
          miniskirts----just walked in the bar. He catches the twosome
          stealing a glance in their direction.

          The wrestlers are dancing with the women, MELISSA and ALYSSA,
          on the bar's dance floor. Melissa is sandwiched between
          Booker D and McPride, shaking her ass for them like a 19-year-
          old spring breaker.
          
          Alyssa is paired off with Randy, grinding her ass against
          him. She turns, facing him. Looks at him with a coy smile.
          
                              ALYSSA
                    I know who you are.
          
          She slowly runs her hands up Randy's sides.

                    My brother used to have your poster

          Randy smiles, pleased.
          
                              RANDY
                    Dude's got taste.
          
          Alyssa notices something intriguing over Randy's shoulder.
          Randy turns to see what she's looking at.
          
          RANDY'S POV: Standing by the bar is a MAN.
          
          He turns back to Alyssa.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Who's that?
          
                              ALYSSA
                    A.J. My old coke dealer.
          
          Randy nods oh. A slightly weird moment between them.
          
                              ALYSSA (CONT'D)
                    I don't do that anymore.
          
                              RANDY
                    Me neither.
          
          They exchange a look.
          
                                                          HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A single-person bathroom. Randy and Alyssa are doing BUMPS OF
          COKE.
          
                                                                    93.
          
          
          INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is FUCKING Alyssa from behind over the bathroom sink.
          Alyssa MOANS LOUDLY.
          
                              ALYSSA
                    Oh, Gawddd...
          
          There's a KNOCK at the door.
          
                              WOMAN (O.S.)
                        (through door)
                    Could you please fuck someplace
                    else? I gotta piss.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          BLACK SCREEN.
          
          RANDY'S POV:   His eyes slowly open. Staring down at him from a
          white stucco   ceiling is a poster of a HUNKY, SHIRTLESS
          FIREMAN with   a pair of suspenders stretched across his oiled-
          up six pack.   Across the bottom it says FIVE-ALARM FIRE.
          
          Randy looks around, disoriented. He is NAKED in a strange bed
          in a strange bedroom. His clothes lie on the floor next to a
          LARGE GLASS BONG.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy, wearing only a pair of bikini briefs, staggers into
          the KITCHEN. A ROOMMATE (23) in a Tweety Bird nightshirt is
          pouring herself a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. She looks at
          Randy with a casual "wassup" head-nod.
          
                              ROOMMATE
                    Alyssa's in the shower.
          
          
          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy emerges from Alyssa's building in the previous night's
          clothes, squinting at the blinding sunlight.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy enters his trailer, chuckling amusedly. He tosses his
          keys on the table.
          
          He heads over to the fridge and grabs a beer. As he closes
          the fridge, his expression changes. A look of DEEP DISMAY
          comes over his face.
          
                                                                     94.
          
          
          RANDY'S POV: The old photo of him and Stephanie on the fridge
          door.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy rings the bell. Stephanie's "friend" answers the door.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hey.
          
          She stares at him coldly and unnervingly.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Is Stephanie home?
          
          She goes into the house, closing the door behind her. Randy
          stands there awkwardly, unsure what that meant.
          
          He thinks about knocking but doesn't. He carefully turns the
          knob, leaning into the house. From somewhere inside, he hears
          the MUFFLED SOUND of Stephanie and The Friend talking.
          
          
          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Stephanie and The Friend are arguing in the living room.
          
                              THE FRIEND
                    You don't have to go out there. You
                    don't owe him shit.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I know that.
          
                               THE FRIEND
                    Then why would you even----
                        (looks up toward front
                         DOOR)
                    Who said you could come in?
          
          THE FRIEND'S/STEPHANIE'S POV: Standing there is Randy, gazing
          guiltily at Stephanie.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Please leave my house.
          
                                RANDY
                    I'm so, so sorry. I completely,
                    TOTALLY----
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
                              THE FRIEND
                    Get the fuck out of here!
          
                              STEPHANIE
                        (to The Friend)
                    I can handle this.
          
                              THE FRIEND
                    Obviously not.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                        (teeth gritted)
                    I can handle this, Jen.
          
          The Friend, disgusted, grabs her coat and STORMS OFF out the
          front door.
          
          Randy and Stephanie are alone. She glares at him for what
          feels like a long time.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    You're such a fucking asshole.
          
                              RANDY
                    I feel horrible.
          
                               STEPHANIE
                    I waited in that restaurant two
                    hours. Two fucking hours. Just in
                    case you showed up late. "Maybe he
                    got stuck in traffic. Maybe I got
                    the time wrong"...
                        (BEAT)
                    Nope.
          
                              RANDY
                    I know I fucked up. I fucked up
                    bad.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    You didn't fuck up. You are a fuck-
                    up. A walking, living, breathing
                    fuck-up.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm trying to change. Really. I
                    can't stand when I----
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Just please shut the fuck up.
                    Because I can't even stand the
                    sound of your voice.
                        (SEETHING)
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                   96.
          
                               STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    I thought about having a drink for
                    the first time in 11 months last
                    night. That's what you do to me.
                        (BEAT)
                    You asshole!
          
          She grabs a SMALL POTTED PLANT off the table and THROWS IT AT
          HIM. It NARROWLY MISSES HIS HEAD, exploding against the wall.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    Fucking piece-of-shit asshole!
          
          She grabs a CAN OF SODA off the same table and THROWS IT. It
          NAILS HIM IN THE THIGH, exploding open on the floor. Soda
          sprays everywhere.
          
                              RANDY
                    Jesus! Stop!
          
          She looks around, half-crazed, searching for something else
          to throw. He rushes toward her, wrapping her up in his arms.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Get off me!
          
                                 RANDY
                    Calm down!
          
          He SQUEEZES TIGHTER. She THRASHES AROUND, fighting it.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    GET THE FUCK OFF ME!
          
                                 RANDY
                    Calm down!
          
                              STEPHANIE
                        (thrashing violently)
                    I HATE YOU!
          
                              RANDY
                    You don't mean that!
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    FUCKING HATE YOU!
          
                              RANDY
                    YOU DON'T MEAN IT!
          
          Suddenly, she STOPS RESISTING. A STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED CALM
          washes over her.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I don't mean it?
          
                                                            97.
          
          
          She is silent and still.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    You're right. I don't.
          
          She shakes her head, placidly gazing off.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't know why I got so
                    hysterical. There's no reason. I
                    don't hate you. I don't love you. I
                    don't like you. I was stupid to
                    think you could change.
          
                              RANDY
                    I can change.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I don't care.
          
                              RANDY
                    I know I can.
          
                               STEPHANIE
                    Doesn't matter. I don't care. I'm
                    done.
                        (BEAT)
                    No more fixing it. It's broke.
                    Permanently. I'm cool with it. It's
                    better that way.
          
          She turns and looks him in the eye.
          
                               STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't want to ever see you again.
                    I don't wanna see you, I don't want
                    to hear you...
                        (BEAT)
                    Done. You understand?
          
          Randy doesn't.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    Actually, I don't care if you
                    understand.
          
          She walks toward the front door. Opens it wide.
          
                               STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye.

          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy steps out the front door. Stephanie's cellphone rings.
          She looks at the caller ID and picks up.
          
                               STEPHANIE
                    You can come home.
                        (BEAT)
                    He's gone.
          
          She closes the door on him, disappearing inside the house.
          
          Randy stands there alone on his daughter's front step. Unsure
          what to do. He starts to CRY.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It reads NOW SERVING: 54
          
          A crowd of AGGRAVATED CUSTOMERS stand waiting at the counter.
          A FAT GUY in a motorized cart clutching a 71 throws a fellow
          customer a "Do you believe these morons?" eye roll.
          
          Behind the counter are Randy and a COWORKER. Randy is putting
          a block of Havarti onto the slicer. He moves lackadaisically,
          distractedly.
          
          Wayne, noticing as he roams past, heads over.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Let's pick it up. Rush hour.
          
          Wayne gives him TWO QUICK CLAPS and walks off. Randy adjusts
          the machine's setting and begins to slice. He isn't moving
          much faster.

          While we're young...             Any year now...
          
          Randy keeps right on slicing at his unhurried pace. He gets
          in a nice, meditative groove.
          
          Slice, slice, slice, slice, slice...
          
          He watches as his thumb inches closer to the spinning blade.
          He stares at his thumb. At the blade. His thumb.
          
          He JAMS HIS THUMB INTO THE BLADE.
          
          Blood squirts everywhere. On his coat. On the deli meat.
          
                                                                     99.
          
          
          Randy stares at the DEEP GASH, watching as blood pulses out
          in crimson surges. He smiles strangely at it.
          
          A customer GASPS. A commotion quickly spreads.
          
                                 WAYNE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Randy!
          
          Randy turns and sees a shocked Wayne rushing toward him.
          Wayne takes Randy's arm and tries to lead him into the back,
          out of view.
          
                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        (conscious of customers
                         WATCHING)
                    Let's get that patched up.
          
          Randy roughly SHOVES him away. Wayne stumbles backwards.
          
          Randy, turning toward the onlookers, raises his thumb to his
          face. He dramatically smears the BLOOD ACROSS HIS MOUTH.
          
          Customers GASP. A woman SHRIEKS.
          
          Randy drags the gash across his cheek. He SMEARS A LINE OF IT
          under each eye like WARPAINT.
          
                              RANDY
                        (striking wrestling pose)
                    Let's get it onnn!
          
                              WAYNE
                    Somebody call the cops!
          
          Randy ROARS at Wayne. Wayne JUMPS BACK, frightened. Randy
          rumbles out of the deli area LAUGHING.
          
          
          SUPERMARKET AISLE:
          
          Randy dashes down an aisle. He dodges a WOMAN PUSHING A
          SHOPPING CART, purposely "over-dodging" her so he CRASHES
          INTO THE SHELVES and sends stuff flying. He dodges ANOTHER
          SHOPPER, dramatically crashing into the shelves again.
          
          
          FRONT REGISTER AREA:
          
          Randy charges past the CASHIERS, out of the supermarket.
          
                                                                 100.
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits in the van in the Shop-Rite parking lot. He gazes
          at himself in the rear-view mirror, dried blood caked on his
          face.
          
          He likes it.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

                    he's there.

          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Randy is digging through a pile of clothes in a closet. He
          pulls out his WRESTLING TIGHTS.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Randy, wearing rubber gloves and a towel around his neck,
          combs PEROXIDE through his hair.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Randy is SHAVING HIS CHEST. The hair has grown in since he
          last wrestled.
          
                                                                 101.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER
          
          Randy stands in the middle of the trailer in just a pair of
          bikini briefs. In his hands is a product called TAN IN A CAN.
          He gives the can a good shake and starts spraying his body.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy puts a snacks-and-soda-filled plastic bag in the front
          of the van. He is surprised to see Cassidy pull up in her
          car. She gets out.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Hi.
          
                              RANDY
                    How'd you find me?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Big Chris. Cheetah's bouncer.
          
          Randy nods oh.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Look, I'm sorry if I came off like
                    a bitch. I didn't mean that stuff I
                    said. You're not just a customer.
          
          Randy nods. He heads toward his trailer. Cassidy follows.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm sure it seems retarded, but I
                    gotta keep that line. It's how I've
                    been able to live with myself the
                    last 12 years.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy enters the trailer, Cassidy close behind.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    There's a place I'm trying to get
                    to in my life. For me and my son.
          
          Randy heads to his wheelie bag, open on the bed.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm leaving that world behind. And
                    I can't bring anybody with me who----
          
                                                                  102.
          
          
                              RANDY
                        (doesn't really care)
                    Good for you. Quitting's hard.
          
          He zips up his bag. Walks outside toward his van. She
          follows.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Where are you going?
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
          
          He gets in the van.
          
                              RANDY
                    Got a match.
          
          He grabs the Fanfest flyer off the passenger seat and hands
          it to her.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    See ya later.
          
          He DRIVES OFF. She watches him go, the van kicking up dust in
          its wake.
          
          She looks at flier. A look of concern comes over her face.
          
          
          INT. VAN - EVENING
          
          MUSIC: SKID ROW - "I REMEMBER YOU"
          
          Randy is driving south on the New Jersey Turnpike.
          
          
          INT. CASSIDY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy grabs her purse and car keys off the kitchen table.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    In bed by 11. Don't let him
                    bargain.
          
          The BABYSITTER (15) nods at the instructions. Cassidy heads
          toward the...
          
          
          LIVING ROOM:
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Bye, monkey...
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          She is struck by what she sees.
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: DANIEL (9) is on the floor, playing with the
          Randy The Ram doll.
          
          She watches as he makes the Randy doll climb up the couch's
          armrest. The doll takes a FLYING LEAP off the couch, onto a
          STAR WARS FIGURE laid out on the floor below. Daniel makes an
          EXPLOSION SOUND as Randy slams down on his foe.
          
          Cassidy looks at the doll, worried.

          Cassidy is dancing onstage. She has a distracted, faraway
          look in her eye.
          
          She abruptly WALKS OFF mid-song.
          
          She heads toward the dressing room, disappearing through the
          curtain.
          
                                CLUB D.J. (O.S.)

          INT. DRESSING AREA - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy unlocks her locker. She throws everything in it into
          a duffel bag. She grabs the MASTER LOCK off the locker door
          and throws it into the bag, too.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy, wearing her coat, steps through the curtain with the

          She cuts across the empty stage, toward the exit.

                    ever again.
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm going back to the ring. You
                    were right about me. Everything you
                    said. Anyway... I just wanted you

          INT. CASSIDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy is driving south on the New Jersey Turnpike. She's on
          her cellphone. On the passenger seat is the Fanfest flyer.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    There's waffles in the freezer and
                    some burritos if he wants for
                    lunch. He knows where.
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm not sure what time I'll be

          Randy's van is pulled over on the side of the interstate.
          
          
          INT. BACK OF VAN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy is catching a nap as 18-wheelers barrel past.
          
                                                                  105.

                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yeah, nah, business is rockin'.
                    Just opened a third dealership.
          
          Randy looks down a row of lockers.
          
          RANDY'S POV: A huge, dark-skinned man in khakis and a BOB
          ZAYID PONTIAC polo is talking to SOME OTHER WRESTLER. This is
          THE AYATOLLAH (52).
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    That makes two in Columbus, one in
                    Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say
                    Cincy's not out of the question.
          
                              OTHER WRESTLER
                        (not too interested)
                    Wow...
          
          The Ayatollah looks up and sees Randy looking at him.
          
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                    Ram-A-Lam.
          
          Randy heads over.

                    Yo, Carl.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think
                    we were gonna do this.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, well, I'm here.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    Thursday night, I get a call, "It's
                    on! He's back in!" I'm like "What?"
          
          The Ayatollah chortles.
          
                                                                 106.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    When you get settled in, we should
                    go over things.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    What things?
          
                              RANDY
                    Y'know, the spots.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    Ah, we can just wing it.
          
                              RANDY
                    You don't wanna hash it out?
          
          The Ayatollah gives him a dismissive, cavalier wave.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    It'll be fine.
          
                              RANDY
                    We should have at least a basic
                    plan.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    How's this: I'm the heel, you're
                    the face. Done.
          
          The Ayatollah chuckles. Randy walks off, highly annoyed.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        (to other wrestler)
                    Anyway, if you're ever in Ohio,
                    swing on by. I'll make you a nice
                    deal on a G6.
          
          
          INT. GAS STATION - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Cassidy pulls into a gas station. She rolls down the window.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Excuse me.
          
          A GAS STATION ATTENDANT looks her way.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Do you know where the Civic
                    Auditorium is?
          
                                                                   107.
          
          
          INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - LATER
          
          The card is underway. Through a wall, we hear the muffled
          sounds of a MATCH IN PROGRESS: cheers, boos, crashes, etc.
          
          Randy, sitting alone on a bench in just his jock strap, tapes
          up his legs. His focus and intensity builds.
          
          
          EXT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME
          LATER
          
          Cassidy pulls into the lot. There's a lot more cars than when
          Randy pulled in.
          
          
          INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - OUTER CONCOURSE - SHORT
          TIME LATER
          
          The building's outer concourse. A handful of fans mill about
          at a CONCESSIONS STAND and a SOUVENIR TABLE.
          
          Cassidy, handing a ticket to an USHER, enters the building.
          She looks around the concourse, not quite sure where to go.
          
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER
          
          Randy, suited up in his tights, paces the floor, gearing
          himself up for the match. The only other wrestler in the
          locker room at the moment is The Ayatollah, doing neck rolls
          nearby. Randy catches his eyes.
          
                              RANDY
                    Ready to do this?
          
          Through the wall, ARABIC MUSIC starts to play.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    Believe so.
          
          The Ayatollah grabs a large IRANIAN FLAG leaning against the
          lockers. He heads toward an ENTRANCE CURTAIN, Randy close
          behind.
          
                               ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        (through curtain)
                    From the Islamic Republic of Iran,
                    weighing in at 252 pounds... The
                    Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The
                    Middle East...
                        (BEAT)
                    The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah!
          
                                                                    108.
          
          
          The Ayatollah steps through the curtain, Iranian flag raised
          high. He is promptly greeted with LUSTY BOOS.
          
          
          INT. OUTER CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy is walking around the concourse with a mounting sense
          urgency. She spots a SECURITY GUY in a yellow windbreaker
          sitting by an UNMARKED DOOR. She heads toward him.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Excuse me.
          
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy is peering through the narrow gap in the curtain,
          watching The Ayatollah make his entrance.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)
                        (faint, amidst the boos)
                    Death to America!
          
                                 CASSIDY (O.S.)
                    Randy.
          
          Randy, turning, is surprised to see Cassidy standing there.
          She looks tired and worried and scared.
          
                              RANDY
                    What are you doing here?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Don't do this. This is dumb.
          
                              RANDY
                    This ain't the best time to talk.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    What about your heart?
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I'll be fine.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I thought the doctor...
          
                              RANDY
                    They always say that. Whatever you
                    got.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You could really hurt yourself.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    I know what I'm doing in there.
                        (turns vaguely sad)
                    Out here's where I get hurt.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Out here's what counts. The real
                    world.
          
                              RANDY
                    Fuck the real world. Nobody gives a
                    shit about me in the real world.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I quit my job, drove 14 hours
                    through the night to get here. What
                    do you call that?
          
          Randy looks away, unable to hold her gaze. Through the
          curtain, we hear the Arabic music DIE DOWN.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        (from auditorium)
                    And his opponent...
          
          A new, familiar song rises on the auditorium speakers.
          
          MUSIC: AC/DC - "IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)"
          
          The crowd roars.
          
                              RANDY
                        (points to curtain)
                    Listen to them! This is where I'm
                    great. This is where I belong.
          
          Randy looks at the curtain. He looks at Cassidy.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    From Elizabeth, New Jersey,
                    weighing in at 219 pounds...
          
                              RANDY
                    I gotta go.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Randy. Please.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'll see you after the show.
          
                                CASSIDY
                          (grabs him)
                    No.
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
          He pulls her off.
          
                              RANDY
                    Enjoy the show.
          
          He turns away from her, toward the curtain.
          
                               ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    A true wrestling immortal, one of
                    the greatest of all time...
                        (BEAT)
                    Randy "The Ram" Robinnnnsonnnnn!
          
          He steps through.
          
          
          INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy bursts through the curtain to HUGE CHEERS. There's
          probably 700 people there in the 2,200-seat facility.
          
          
          INT. COMMENTATORS' TABLE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Seated at a ringside table are the match's COMMENTATORS, a
          pair of wannabe Marv Alberts in their 20s. A sign taped to
          the table reads CAROLINA WRESTLING NETWORK. Next to the table
          is a VIDEOCAMERA on a tripod.
          
                              COMMENTATOR #1
                    There he is, folks! Randy The Ram!
          
          Randy raises a set of ram's horns high in the air. Fans do
          the same in tribute.
          
                              COMMENTATOR #2
                    History about to be made here at
                    the Greenville Civic Auditorium.
          
          Randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after
          chair. His head gets a little bloody. The fans eat it up.
          
          Randy climbs into the ring, where The Ayatollah awaits.
          
          The cheers continue. Loving, appreciative, sustained cheers.
          Randy stands there soaking it in, basking in their love.
          
          He grabs the microphone from the ring announcer. He looks
          around. A hush comes over the crowd.
          
                              RANDY
                    I just got one thing to say to you
                    people...
          
                                                                   111.
          
          
          Randy looks toward Cassidy, standing over by the entrance
          curtain. He looks out at the larger crowd.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
          LOUD CHEERS. Randy takes a contemplative pause.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You take your lumps and bruises in
                    this game. But you know what? It's
                    all worth it. Because of you guys.
                    Your cheers keep me young. They
                    make me feel alive.
                        (BEAT)
                    In 1982, the year I wrestled my
                    first professional match, I was six-
                    foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot-
                    eleven. Three back surgeries in 11
                    years knocked two full inches off
                    my height. I may be down to five-
                    eleven, but performing in front of
                    you people has always made me feel
                    10 feet tall. And that's the way
                    it's always gonna be.
          
          Randy looks toward Cassidy, who's standing over by the
          entrance curtain. Their eyes meet.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Forever.
          
          Randy lowers the mike, finished. The fans CHEER WILDLY, the
          loudest cheers yet.
          
          As Randy nods appreciatively at the crowd, The Ayatollah
          SNEAKS UP BEHIND HIM with a folding chair.
          
          Fans shout, trying to warn Randy about the sneak attack, but
          he doesn't hear them.
          
          The Ayatollah SMASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD. Randy goes down. The
          match is on.
          
          The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.
          Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up
          an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead
          his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up
          and grabs The Ayatollah.
          
          The Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes
          again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for
          Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot.
          
                                                                  112.
          
          
                                RANDY (CONT'D)
                          (under breath)
                      You're workin' pretty light here.
          
          Randy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah's arms. With a nifty
          move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM
          HARD into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing The
          Ayatollah's face into the canvas.
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH
                      Jesus. Relax.
          
          Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his
          shoulder blades. The REF swoops in.
          
                                REFEREE
                      One!... Two!...
          
          The Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs
          toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something
          good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The
          Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock.
          
                                RANDY
                      Anytime you wanna join in.
          
          Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee
          with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits
          the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him
          with a FLYING ELBOW DROP.
          
          The Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment.
          
          Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his
          ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy's legs, sending
          Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The
          Ayatollah falls on Randy's throat with his knee. He grinds
          Randy's face into the canvas as Randy did to him.
          
          
          ENTRANCE CURTAIN:
          
          Cassidy is cringing. It's hard for her to watch this.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH
                      That better?
          
                                RANDY
                      Much.
          
                                                                     113.
          
          
          The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.
          Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The
          Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him
          in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee.
          Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side. The Ayatollah
          falls on top of him.
          
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                       Forgot how much fun this is.
          
          The ref swoops in.
          
                                 REFEREE
                       One!... Two!...
          
          Randy KICKS OUT. As Randy "recovers", The Ayatollah jumps out
          of the ring and grabs a folding chair.
          
          The Ayatollah, climbing back in, props up the chair in a
          corner. He picks Randy off the mat and flings him at the
          chair. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, sailing through the ropes and
          OUT OF THE RING. He hits the concrete floor, CRASHING against
          the metal barricade.
          
          
          ENTRANCE CURTAIN:
          
          Cassidy winces. She starts to tear up a little.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy,
          kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it
          tauntingly at the crowd.
          
                  FAN #1 (O.S.)                      FAN #2 (O.S.)
          Camelfucker!                       Fat piece of shit!
          
          The Ayatollah looks down at Randy.
          
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                       Pathetic.
                           ("spits" on Randy)
                       Pitiful godless infidel!
          
          
          THE CROWD:
          
          Boos rain down on The Ayatollah.
          
                                                                 114.
          
          
          JUST OUTSIDE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and JABS IT
          into Randy's side. Randy grimaces in pain.
          
          The Ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT
          around Randy's neck. He JERKS UPWARD on the flag, lifting
          Randy off the mat by his neck. Randy THRASHES AROUND,
          fighting for breath.
          
          The Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy crumples
          to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up Randy
          by his hair and flings him back in the ring.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He
          SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is
          BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at
          the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat.
          
          
          ENTRANCE CURTAIN:
          
          Cassidy, alarmed, instinctively goes halfway toward the ring.
          
                                   CASSIDY
                      Randy!
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah scoops up Randy and BODYSLAMS him. He falls on
          Randy knee-first and starts punching him repeatedly.
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH
                          (under breath)
                      Wanna take it home?
          
          Randy's eyes drift in Cassidy's direction.
          
          RANDY'S POV: Cassidy is CRYING.
          
                                CASSIDY
                      Stop it! Stop it, Randy!
          
          Randy turns back to The Ayatollah.
          
                                   RANDY
                      It's time.
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH
                      All you, bro. Lead the way.
          
                                                                 115.
          
          
          Randy flips The Ayatollah over. Randy struggles to his feet.
          He picks up The Ayatollah and levels him with a dropkick.
          
                              COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                    Dropkick!
                        (a second one)
                    And another!
                        (a third one)
                    And another!
          
          His heart is POUNDING. The fans sense it's near the end. A
          chant rises:
          
                              CROWD (O.S.)
                    Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
          Randy falls on top of The Ayatollah, putting him in a rest-
          move headlock.
          
                              CROWD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
                              COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
                    Just listen to this crowd!
          
          The Ayatollah can hear how labored Randy's breathing is.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    If you ain't up to it...
          
                              CROWD (O.S.)
                    Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
          Randy looks around at the crowd, chanting, hungry for the Ram
          Jam. He looks The Ayatollah in the eye.
          
                              RANDY
                    Let's do this.
          
          Randy gets up. He lifts The Ayatollah off the mat, locking up
          with him chest-to-chest. He arches his back and thrusts his
          hips. The Ayatollah's feet fly off the canvas as his legs
          whip into the air. His body does a COMPLETE FLIP as he slams
          onto his back. Randy stays with him, his body contorting in a
          tight BACK FLIP as he CRASHES DOWN on top of him.
          
                              COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                    Lateral drop!
          
          Randy gets up. His HEART LURCHES.
          
          He lowers himself back down to his knees. Puts his hand to
          his chest. Something just happened.
          
                                                                    116.
          
          
          Randy looks out at the crowd. The whole place is on its feet.
          
                                CROWD (O.S.)
                      Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
          Randy's heart LURCHES AGAIN.
          
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                      Y'okay?
          
          The Ayatollah sees he's clearly not.
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH (CONT'D)
                      Just pin me.
          
          Randy looks out at the crowd again. The fans are in a frenzy.
          
                                CROWD (O.S.)
                      RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)
                      Finish it. Pin me.
          
          Randy is torn. He...
          
          GETS UP.
          
          Randy STAGGERS to the corner. His heartbeat is UNNATURAL AND
          DEAFENING.
          
          BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...
          
          
          ON CASSIDY:
          
          Cassidy can't take any more. She turns and WALKS.
          
          
          ON RANDY:
          
          Randy plants a foot on the bottom rope. He looks toward
          Cassidy.
          
          RANDY'S POV: He catches a glimpse of Cassidy disappearing
          through the curtain into the locker room.
          
          Randy looks out on the crowd. Chanting, cheering. He starts
          to climb. Standing on the top rope, he looks again at the
          curtain. She's gone.
          
          
          HALLWAY:
          
          Cassidy exits the arena sobbing.
          
                                                                 117.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah lies on the ground in pain.
          
          
          ON RANDY:
          
          Randy raises his arms and sticks his elbows out, pressing his
          fists to the sides of his head to form a set of RAM'S HORNS.
          
                                 COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
                       Uh-oh, the horns are out...
          
          Randy takes a long look around the auditorium, lingering on
          the fans' faces, savoring their cheers.
          
          He SMILES.
          
                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                       Here we go...
          
          BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...
          
          He LEAPS.
          
          FREEZE on Randy in mid-air, glorious and immortal.
          
                                                               THE END

          FROM BLACK, VOICES EMERGE--
          We hear the actual recorded emergency calls made by World
          Trade Center office workers to police and fire departments
          after the planes struck on 9/11, just before the buildings
          collapsed.

          TITLE OVER: SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
          We listen to fragments from a number of these calls...starting
          with pleas for help, building to a panic, ending with the
          caller's grim acceptance that help will not arrive, that the
          situation is hopeless, that they are about to die.

          INT. BLACK SITE - INTERROGATION ROOM


                         DANIEL
          I own you, Ammar. You belong to me.
          Look at me.
          This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA's man in Islamabad - a big
          American, late 30's, with a long, anarchical beard snaking
          down to his tattooed neck. He looks like a paramilitary
          hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          (explaining the rules)
          If you don't look at me when I talk
          to you, I hurt you. If you step off
          this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to
          me, I'm gonna hurt you. Now, Look
          at me.
          His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded
          by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks.
          Ammar looks down. Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching
          and kicking.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Look at me, Ammar.
          Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take
          part in the beating.

          EXT. BLACK SITE - LATER

          Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation
          room into the light of day. They remove their masks and we
          see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties.
          She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin
          and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core
          that we will come to realize is off-the-charts. This is
          MAYA, a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first
          overseas assignment.

                         DANIEL
          (to the guard)
          Are we gonna board up these windows
          or what?

                         (TO MAYA)
          Just off the plane from Washington,
          you're rocking your best suit for
          your first interrogation, and then
          you get this guy. It's not always
          this intense.

                         MAYA
          I'm fine.
          She's not.

                         DANIEL
          Just so you know, it's going to take
          awhile. He has to learn how helpless
          he is. Let's get a coffee.

                         MAYA
          No, we should go back in.
          Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes
          Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation
          room.

                         DANIEL
          You know, there's no shame if you
          wanna watch from the monitor.
          She shakes her head.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Alright.
          At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          You might want to put this on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         MAYA
          You're not wearing one. Is he ever
          getting out?

                         DANIEL
          Never.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER


          SUPERIMPOSE: CIA BLACK SITE - UNDISCLOSED LOCATION
          Ammar, bruised from the beating, is restrained with ropes.
          Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of
          what is to come. This is her first interrogation and she is
          on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room. She
          looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water
          on the floor.

                         DANIEL
          Right now, this is about you coming
          to terms with your situation. It's
          you and me, bro. I want you to
          understand that I know you, that
          I've been studying you for a very
          long time. I could have had you
          killed Karachi. But I let you live
          so you and I could talk.

                         AMMAR

                         (RESISTANT)
          You beat me when my hands are tied.
          I won't talk to you.

                         DANIEL
          Life isn't always fair, my friend.
          Did you really think that when we
          got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy?

                         AMMAR
          You're a mid-level guy. You're a
          garbage man in a corporation. Why
          should I respect you?

                         DANIEL
          And you're a money man. A paperboy!
          Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          A disgrace to humanity!

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          You and your uncle murdered three
          thousand innocent people. I have
          your name on a five-thousand dollar
          transfer via Western Union to a 9/11
          hijacker.
          He leans into Ammar's ear. Uncomfortably close.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          And you got popped with 150 kilograms
          of high explosives in your house!

          AND THEN YOU DARE QUESTION ME?!
          And then Daniel smiles, laughs. Mercurial.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I'm just fucking with you.
          Beat. He laughs again.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I don't want to talk about 9/11.
          What I want to focus on is the Saudi
          group.
          Daniel shows him a photo.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri.
          And I know this dude is up to some
          serious shit, and what I want from
          you is his Saudi email.

                         (PAUSE)
          Feel free to jump in.

                         (PAUSE)
          Ammar, bro, I know that you know
          this dude, just give me his
          email...and I will give you a blanket.
          I will give you a blanket and some
          solid food.
          No response from Ammar. Daniel starts putting on his gloves.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I know that you know him.

                         AMMAR
          I told you before, I won't talk to
          you.

                         DANIEL
          Have it your way.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          (to the masks)
          Let's go.
          It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes
          Ammar to the floor, the guards pin his limbs, and Daniel
          smothers Ammar's face with a towel.
          Ammar thrashes. Daniel considers his next move.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)

                         (TO MAYA)
          Grab the bucket.
          Maya follows Daniel's gesture to the corner of the room,
          where there's an ICE CHEST filled with WATER and a PLASTIC

          PITCHER.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Put some water in it.
          She dips the pitcher in the water, hands shaking.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          C'mon, let's go.
          The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings
          the bucket back to Daniel.
          Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar's face, which is
          now covered by a towel. Ammar thrashes with rising panic.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef,
          you guys met in Tunisia back in the
          70s.

                         AMMAR
          (gasping for breath)
          I don't know, you asshole.
          Maya shakes her head "no."

                         MAYA
          That's not credible.

                         AMMAR

                         (SCREAMING)
          Why are you doing this to me?

                         DANIEL
          You're a terrorist, that's why I'm
          doing it to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         AMMAR
          Fuck you.
          Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar's nose.

                         DANIEL
          I want emails of the rest of the
          Saudi group. Give me emails of the
          rest of the Saudi group! Give me
          one email, and I will stop this!
          Ammar doesn't speak. He can't.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Who's in the Saudi group, and what's
          the target? Where was the last time
          you saw bin Laden? WHERE WAS THE

          LAST TIME YOU SAW BIN LADEN?
          Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar's mouth:
          and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned. He gasps for
          air.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          This is what defeat looks like, bro.
          Your jihad is over.
          Daniel stands.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Get him up.
          The guards bring Ammar to his feet.
          Daniel, shifting his persona yet again, touches Ammar's face
          and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Try to understand the concept here.
          I have time, you don't. I have other
          things to do, you don't.

                         (BEAT)
          It's cool that you're strong. I
          respect it, I do. But in the end,
          everybody breaks, bro. It's biology.
          Dan and Maya exit.
          They've learned nothing.

          That's me, man. No job too small.

                         JACK
          That's why I have a gift for you, my
          friend.
          Jack hands Jeremy a piece of paper. Daniel and Maya enter,
          a little late.

                         DANIEL
          Everyone, this is Maya. Maya,
          everyone.

          11.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Please don't ask how it's going with
          Ammar because she's not going to
          fucking tell you.

                         JESSICA
          Ammar is withholding?
          Daniel nods.

                         JESSICA (CONT'D)
          (reading from her

                         FILE)
          Washington assesses that Abu Faraj
          is officially our new number three -
          JESSICA moves to a wall chart of AQ leadership and repositions
          Abu Faraj's mugshot to number three in the line, two down
          from Usama bin Laden. Meanwhile, in the background, the
          riffs continue -

                         DANIEL
          - Best man for it.

          JACK (O.S.)
          London station is already asking if
          we think he's in contact with anyone
          in the U.K.

                         JEREMY
          Like we're just keeping it from them.
          Jessica sits back down and gets down to business.

                         JESSICA
          The Jordanians are being really
          helpful with Ammar's transit papers.
          Jessica passes Daniel a file.

                         DANIEL
          Any imminent threats in here?

                         JESSICA
          They want the Consulate, the Marriott,
          it's low security. And they've got
          Majid Kahn talking about gas stations
          in the US.

                         DANIEL
          And that's a conversation?
          Jessica shrugs. At this point, she believes that it is merely
          a conversation - not a fully realized plot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         JESSICA
          Honestly? There are six hundred
          questions in there. I'd concentrate
          on Heathrow. The Saudis. Does it
          matter what Faraj thinks about
          Heathrow? How much latitude does he
          get to pick targets?

                         DANIEL
          I think he'll give up the Saudis.
          But Heathrow is gonna be tough.
          Anyway. Anything from last night?

          J.J.
          Quetta base thinks they have a bead
          on the Arabs that escaped, and they're
          going to meet with the ISI this
          afternoon, hopefully to set up a
          raid down there.

                         DANIEL
          Great.

                         JEREMY
          And Lahore reporting ISI down there
          was painfully slow last night. Again.
          I'm beginning to think it's not
          incompetence.

                         DANIEL
          I agree, I spoke to the Chief about
          that. Anything on bin Laden?

                         JESSICA
          (reading from a cable)
          A farmer on the Afghan border near
          Tora Bora reports: a diamond shaped
          pattern in the hills, tall male in
          the center of the diamond, flanked
          by four guards. It's consistent
          with UBL's movements.

                         JEREMY
          That's supposed to be his royal guard?

                         MAYA
          That's pre-9/11 behavior.
          Jessica doesn't appreciate the challenge.

                         JESSICA

                         (CHILLY)
          We don't have reason to believe he's
          changed security tactics.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         MAYA
          We invaded Afghanistan. That's a
          reason.
          And so the rivalry begins.

          J.J.
          Hey, boss, I got a guy for five
          thousand bucks, he can set up a taxi
          stand and snoop around a bit.

                         DANIEL
          No, don't need him, the diamond
          sighting is bullshit. See if the
          Paks will send someone to talk to
          the farmer. Anything else? We need
          to be putting runs on the board
          against Faraj. Speak to the case
          officers who didn't see fit to make
          it today. And thank them.

          INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - ISLAMABAD

          The loud WAILING of the early morning call to prayer from
          the loudspeakers of a nearby mosque wakes Maya on the couch.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BLACK SITE - AFTERNOON

          Daniel and the guards enter Ammar's cell with Maya. Daniel
          switches on a floodlight, awakening Ammar.

                         DANIEL
          Let's take it easy today, huh?
          Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of
          falafel.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Hungry? The food in here sucks so I
          got you some of this.
          Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Richard Reid, wow. I was thinking
          about him. The guy gets a bomb in
          his shoe on a plane. Unbelievable.
          You know him, don't you?
          Slowly, Ammar nods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         AMMAR
          Yes.

                         DANIEL
          I'm glad you said that. I have an
          email from you to him. I've had all
          your coms for years, bro. Who else
          is in your Saudi group?

                         AMMAR
          I just handed out some cash for them.
          I didn't know who the guys were.

                         DANIEL
          When you lie to me, I hurt you.

                         AMMAR
          Please.

                         DANIEL
          I believe you. I do, I believe you.
          Beat.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Do you want the water again, or do
          you want something else?

                         AMMAR
          Please.

                         DANIEL
          Just give me a name.

                         AMMAR

                         I DON'T--
          Daniel jumps up.

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          I don't know.
          Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar. The masked
          guards walk to the rope pulleys.

                         DANIEL
          You see how this works? You don't
          mind if my female colleague sees
          your junk, do you?
          Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants. Maya flinches at the bare
          nakedness.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Dude, you shit your pants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.
          Daniel turns to Maya -

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          You stay here, I'll be back.
          Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the
          naked, chained man.
          Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his
          eyes.

                         AMMAR
          Your friend is an animal. Please,
          help me. Please.
          A long beat.

                         MAYA
          You can help yourself by being
          truthful.
          The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel
          was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a
          DOG COLLAR in his hand.

                         DANIEL
          This is a dog collar.
          Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his
          neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation.
          Maya flinches. Daniel is relentless:

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          You determine how I treat you.
          Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I'm going to walk you.
          Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner
          of the room, then leans down to address his victim:

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          What the fuck do you think is going
          on, Ammar? Wahleed has already told
          me that you know.
          At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a
          large wooden box resting on a platform.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          This box sucks. I'm going to put
          you in it.
          Ammar tries to speak but can't get a word out.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          When is the attack?

                         AMMAR

                         (VERY SOFTLY)
          Sunday.

                         DANIEL
          Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday
          or next Sunday?
          Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly.

                         AMMAR
          Monday.

                         DANIEL
          Is it Sunday or Monday?
          Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Which day is it? Partial information
          is treated as a lie.

                         AMMAR
          Saturday.
          Beat. The masked men open the box.

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          Sunday!
          The guards grab Ammar and carry him to his wooden tomb. He
          shouts with his last reserve of energy:

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          Monday!

                         DANIEL
          Ammar, which day?

                         AMMAR

                         (MUMBLING)
          Monday, Tuesday,
          Beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          Thursday.
          Beat.

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          Friday.
          Daniel slams the box shut. Once again, he's learned nothing.

          clothes, rises to shoulder height.

          INT. KHOBAR TOWERS - DAY

          - The man enters the hallway of the KHOBAR RESIDENTIAL TOWERS

          to find inside, killing them both.

          TITLE OVER: MAY 29, 2004
          - The CRACK of the shots sends the rest of the residents
          into a panicky, screaming dash for cover

          attack they tried to prevent by pressuring Ammar has occurred.

                         (TO DANIEL)
          Don't worry about the Saudis, they'll
          take care of business.

                         DANIEL

          It's not on you.

                         DANIEL
          Who said that? Zied? Fuck him.
          This is on me. Ammar is on me!!

          No, no, no. You had - what - days -
          brief custody - and an unresponsive
          ally. The way you do this is you
          look ahead. London. Heathrow. Mass
          casualties. That plan is still
          active.

                         MAYA
          Ammar doesn't have a clue about what
          happened.

                         JESSICA
          He knows.

                         MAYA
          How?

                         JESSICA
          You have to be really careful with
          people in KSM's circle - they're
          devious.

                         MAYA
          He's not going to talk about attacks
          on the homeland. He's going to
          withhold operational details on the
          KSM network and probably on bin Laden.
          (flipping her argument)
          But he's been in complete isolation,
          he doesn't know we failed. We can
          tell him anything.

                         DANIEL
          Bluff him?

                         MAYA

          You don't remember, do you? You -
          me: same same. Bad memory.
          While GUARDS move in the deep b.g., Daniel and Maya are seated
          at a picnic table with an appetizing spread of Arabic food.

          DANIEL (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
          Short term memory loss is a side
          effect of sleep deprivation. It
          should come back to you.
          The Guards bring a prisoner to the table and remove his hood:
          Ammar. He stares weakly at the table.

                         AMMAR

                         (CAREFULLY)
          I don't know. How can I remember?

                         MAYA
          After we kept you awake for 96 hours,
          you gave us names of some of your
          brothers and saved the lives of a
          lot of innocent people.

                         DANIEL
          Which is the smart thing to do, you're
          starting to think for yourself.
          Ammar is lost. But the food is tempting.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Eat up! You earned it.
          Ammar eats.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          So you flew via Amman to Kabul to
          hang out with your uncle? Mukhtar.

                         AMMAR
          How did you know that?

                         DANIEL
          I told you man, I know you. Alright,
          you got me - flight manifests. It
          must've been pretty fucked up for
          you guys after 9/11. What did you
          do after the invasion and before you
          went back to Pesh?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         AMMAR
          After 9/11 I had to choose: fight,
          to protect our turf - or run.

                         DANIEL

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          You chose to fight.
          Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes.

                         AMMAR
          I wanted to kill Americans. We tried
          to get into Tora Bora but the bombing
          was too high. We couldn't cross.

                         MAYA
          Sorry, who is the "we" in that
          sentence?

                         AMMAR
          Me and some guys who were hanging
          around at that time.

                         DANIEL

                         (CASUALLY)
          I can eat with some other dude and
          hook you back up to the ceiling?

                         AMMAR
          Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and
          Abu Ahmed.
          Maya makes notes on her pad.

                         MAYA
          Who's Abu Ahmed? I've heard of the
          other guys.

                         AMMAR
          He was a computer guy with us at the
          time. After Tora Bora, I went back
          to Pesh - as you know - and he went
          North, I think, to Kunar.

                         MAYA
          What's his family name?

                         AMMAR
          Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

                         MAYA
          Abu Ahmed means "father of Ahmed",
          it's a kunya.

                         MAYA (CONT'D)
          Ammar, I know the difference between
          a war name and an Arabic name.

                         DANIEL
          She got you there, dude.

                         AMMAR
          I swear to you both: I don't know
          his family name. I would have never
          asked him something like that. It's
          not how my uncle worked. My uncle
          told me he worked for bin Laden. I
          did see him, once, about a year ago,
          in Karachi. He read us all a letter
          from the Sheikh.

                         MAYA
          A letter?

                         DANIEL
          What did it say?
          Daniel offers Ammar a smoke.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Cigarette?
          Ammar accepts. Daniel's lights it.

                         AMMAR
          It said "Continue the jihad. The
          work will go on for a hundred years."

          watching interrogation video recordings on an array of
          monitors. Some of the videos are rough; but most simply
          depict two people talking. The video she's watching now shows
          a hooded prisoner sitting in a filthy room, the walls smeared

          Some of these brothers have done
          some bad things, and what I want to
          do is I want to separate them from
          the people like you.

          outside of the network - part of a
          series of cutouts and dead drops -
          or if he has a direct connection to
          bin Laden. Does bin Laden invite
          him into the living room and hand
          him a letter directly? Or is Abu
          just the last guy in a long line of
          couriers, so that's why everybody
          knows him?

                         BRADLEY
          That's not all you don't know. You
          don't have his true name, and you
          don't have a clue of where he is.

                         MAYA
          We know that he's important. The
          fact that everybody's heard of Abu
          Ahmed but nobody will tell me where
          he is suggests that.

                         BRADLEY
          Maybe. Detainees could withhold his
          location for any number of reasons.
          Perhaps they don't know; perhaps
          this Abu is just a cover story and
          he's really a fucking unicorn. The
          withholding doesn't reveal what you
          want it to - does it?

                         MAYA
          No.

                         BRADLEY
          And if you did find him, you don't
          know that he'd be with bin Laden.

                         DANIEL
          We don't know what we don't know.

          What the fuck is that supposed to
          mean?

                         DANIEL
          It's a tautology.

          Listen, not one single detainee has
          said that he's located with the big
          guy, just that he delivers messages.
          Am I wrong?

          No.

          EXT. BLACK SITE - PRE-DAWN

          Maya walks around the facility, quiet at this hour, and finds
          another insomniac, Daniel, by the monkey cage. The cage is
          empty.

                         MAYA
          Faraj is completely denying knowing
          Abu Ahmed, and that's using every
          measure we have.

                         DANIEL
          He's either going to withhold or die
          from the pressure you're putting on
          him.

                         MAYA
          Do you want to take a run at him?

                         DANIEL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         MAYA
          No? Since when?

                         DANIEL
          You know, I've been meaning to tell
          you: I'm getting outta here.

                         MAYA
          What? You okay?

                         DANIEL
          I'm fine. I've just seen too many
          guys naked. It's gotta be over a
          hundred at this point. I need to go
          do something normal for awhile.

                         MAYA
          Like what?

                         DANIEL
          Go to Washington, do the dance, see
          how that environment works.

                         (BEAT)
          You should come with me. Be my number
          two. You're looking a little strung
          out yourself.
          Maya looks at Dan. No longer the man he once was. She
          doesn't hide her disappointment.

                         MAYA
          I'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from

          D.C.
          They both look at the empty cage, clocking the irony.

                         DANIEL
          They killed my monkeys.
          Something about an escape. Can you
          fucking believe that?

                         MAYA
          Sorry, Dan.

                         DANIEL
          Look, Maya, you gotta be really
          careful with detainees now. The
          politics are changing and you don't
          want to be the last one holding a
          dog collar when the oversight
          committee comes.

                         MAYA
          I know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         DANIEL
          And watch your back when you get
          back to Pakistan. Everyone knows
          you there now.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. ISLAMABAD - NIGHT

          Back in Pakistan, the country has indeed changed to a more
          militarized police state, and as we establish the new
          environment, we find Maya's grey sedan...

          EXT. ISLAMABAD - NEAR THE MARRIOTT HOTEL - NIGHT

          The car pulls up to a checkpoint manned by PAKISTANI POLICE.
          The Policeman look at the car - look at the plate - the plate
          is diplomatic - they walk around the car and stop at the
          window - shine their bright light right into Maya's eyes.
          A POLICEMAN motions for her to roll down her window.

                         POLICEMAN
          Where are you going?

                         MAYA
          To the Marriott. I assume you noticed
          the dip plates.

                         POLICEMAN
          But you have a bag -
          The policeman motions to a DUFFEL BAG resting on the rear
          seat.

                         MAYA
          It's a gym bag.
          Maya does not get out of the car. She stares at him
          defiantly. He advances forward a bit. She rolls up her
          window, flicks the door lock, and starts dialing her cell
          phone.
          The policeman walks away to rejoin his group. The police
          confer. The original policeman returns, this time with
          several other cops. They knock on the glass. Hard.
          Maya stares straight ahead.

          Maya sits down, absorbed in her Blackberry.

                         JESSICA
          Maya?

                         MAYA
          Yeah.

                         JESSICA
          We're socializing. Be social.
          Maya puts away her blackberry.

                         (HALFHEARTEDLY)
          Okay.

                         JESSICA
          Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby,
          but it's time to cut the umbilical
          cord.

                         MAYA
          No, it's not.

                         JESSICA
          So Faraj went south on you - it
          happens. There are still cells in
          London and Spain planning the next
          round of attacks.

                         MAYA
          I can work on it at the same time -
          plus I think it's a good thing that
          he lied.

                         JESSICA
          No, not at the expense of protecting
          the homeland, you can't. Wait a
          minute, why is it a good thing?

                         MAYA
          You sound just like Bradley. He
          doesn't believe in my lead either.

                         (BEAT)
          It's a good thing because the fact
          that Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed is
          revealing. The only other thing he
          lied about was the location of bin
          Laden himself. That means Faraj
          thinks Abu Ahmed in as important to
          protect as bin Laden. That confirms
          my lead.

                         JESSICA
          Or it's confirmation bias.

                         (BEAT)
          We're all just worried about you,
          okay? Is that okay to say?
          Maya rubs her eyes, not liking where the conversation is
          going. She forces a smile.

                         JESSICA (CONT'D)

          This may be going overboard, but I
          baked him a cake!

          MAYA O.S.
          Muslim's don't celebrate with cake.

                         JESSICA
          Don't be so literal. Everyone likes
          cake. It's not too late for you to
          come, you know. It will be fun.

          I don't want to be a straphangar.
          It's your show. You were the first
          to see the potential in this.

          JESSICA (O.S.)
          Come on! We've got lots of wine!
          The target on Maya's monitor disappears in a puff of smoke.

          Not to get technical, but this guy
          is actually the first big break we've
          had since 9/11. To big breaks and
          the little people that make them

          So far, everything he's said we've
          cross checked and it's proved legit...
          and I think the money is persuasive.
          25 million dollars?! That buys a
          new life.

                         JOHN
          Do you think he might be exaggerating
          his access?

                         JESSICA
          Possibly. But Al Qaeda needs doctors
          and they are short staffed and that
          could explain his rise. In six months
          to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he
          could be called in to treat bin Laden.
          And at that moment, with 25 mil on
          the table, I think he gives up the
          Big Man. And if he doesn't, we kill
          him.

          EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN CIA COMPOUND - AFTERNOON

          The same gathering as the day before, waiting under the
          merciless sun.

          SUPERIMPOSE: DECEMBER 30, 2009
          Jessica turns to her crew, which includes LAUREN, a young
          operative, ZIED, a Jordanian intelligence agent, and the
          base's CIA SECURITY GUARD, among others. They rehearse the
          impending meeting.

                         JESSICA
          So John?
          (John turns to her)
          When he arrives, I'll set the tone,
          and then I'll flip it to you - and
          you'll talk about asset protection.

                         JOHN
          Roger that.

                         JESSICA
          Then Lauren, I know you want to get
          some questions in there - but give
          Balawi time after John speaks. We'll
          cover the basics and have his birthday
          cake, then we'll get to the nitty
          gritty.

          Jessica turns to Zied.

          Is that order okay, or do you want
          to introduce everyone?

                         ZIED
          I'll introduce you, and you introduce
          your team. He knows this is a high
          level meeting.

                         SECURTY GUARD
          Quick question: all is taking place
          inside our main building?

                         JESSICA
          Right. And Lauren? Washington will
          want real time updates so please
          stay on top of that. Be concise.
          The Director is in the loop. And I
          wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't
          update the President.

                         LAUREN
          Yeah, I'm on it.
          They take in the possibilities.

                         JESSICA
          Now, I just need to get Balawi's ass
          down here.

                         LATER -
          Waiting and waiting. No cars approach. The sun beats down.

          EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN - ROAD TO SOUTH GATE

          Several hundred yards before the Camp entrance is a beat-up
          SEDAN. The car pulls up to the checkpoint but doesn't
          proceed.

                         JESSICA
          (to the Security Gyard)
          Why are there gate guards there? We
          talked about this, no one is supposed
          to be there when my source arrives.
          You might have spooked him already!

          This time is different - I'm sorry I
          can't explain, but it's for a good
          cause.

                         SECURTY GUARD
          Look, I'm responsible for everyone's
          safety, okay? It's not just about
          you.

                         JESSICA
          I just need them to go away for a
          minute. You can search him as soon
          as he gets here.
          The Security Guard pauses, then into his radio:

          The guards move away from their post. The sedan drives past
          the gate into a maze of barriers. We follow the car as it
          navigates the maze of HESCO barriers, kicking up a cloud of
          dust.

          Jessica runs back to her team and flashes a thumbs up.
          She smiles and pulls out her phone, sending a text.

                         SECURTY GUARD
          Okay, he's coming. We're gonna search
          him when he gets here.
          Everyone prepares. The car gets closer and closer, a driver
          in front and a passenger in back.

          Maya texts again:

          The sedan pulls to a stop. A BLACKWATER GUARD taps on the
          backseat window. Balawi exits on the passenger side. His
          free hand is in his pocket.

                         BLACKWATER GUARD
          (to the other guard)
          Is he supposed to limp like that?

          Jessica's smile fades
          And Balawi detonates a suicide vest hidden under this jacket
          and the resulting shrapnel storm pulps the crowd, massacring
          them all -

          The office has thinned out, and most people have gone home
          for the day. Maya is crouched in the corner. A wounded
          animal. Jeremy, the case officer from the conference room,
          approaches and gives Maya a computer disc.

          Maya still fighting to contain her grief, takes the file as

          desk of a young woman who reminds us in her idealistic
          enthusiasm of the way Maya was six years ago. This is DEBBIE.

                         DEBBIE
          Hi. I painstakingly combed through
          everything in the system and found

          It's him. He was one of ten names
          on a watch list sent to us by the
          Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed.
          They told us to watch out for him,
          apparently they think his whole family
          and extended family is bad and has
          ties to KSM.

                         (BEAT)
          He was picked up for fake papers and
          a doctored exit visa leaving

          en route to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al-

          African or are distinctive looking for other reasons, most
          of them look fairly similar in that they're all wearing the

          The family name is Sayeed.

                         DANIEL
          Ok, but he's dead. So doesn't that
          make him a little less interesting
          to you?

          MAYA O.S.
          He may not be. We now know that Abu
          Ahmed is one of eight brothers. All
          the brothers in the family look alike.
          Three of them went to Afghanistan.
          Isn't it possible that when the three
          eldest brothers grew beards in
          Afghanistan, they started to look
          alike? I think the one calling
          himself Abu Ahmed is still alive.
          The picture we've been using is wrong.
          It's of his older brother, Habeeb.
          He's the one that's is dead.

          We just have a detainee who buried
          somebody who looked like Abu Ahmed.
          But if somebody as important as Abu
          Ahmed had died, they'd be talking
          about it online in chat rooms all
          over the place. Plus, the detainee
          said that Habeeb died in 2001. We
          know that Abu Ahmed was alive then,
          trying to get into Tora Bora with
          Ammar. That means it's probably one
          of the other brothers that's dead.

          pictures like this of the explosive-
          laden vehicle just moments before it
          was parked, that police hope to find
          the man who wanted so badly last
          night to leave a body count in Times

          INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION CUBICLE HALLWAY

          The TV news report continues playing in the bg.
          Bradley is moving as fast down a hallway. Coming towards
          him like a shark from the other end of the hallway: Maya.
          Bradley looks determined not to deal with her right now, and
          lowers his head, but she spreads her arms slightly and
          basically blocks his passage through the hallway

                         MAYA
          I really need to talk to you about
          beefing up our surveillance operation
          on the caller.

                         BRADLEY
          We don't have a surveillance operation
          on the caller.
          (turning to Maya)
          Someone just tried to blow up Times
          Square and you're talking to me about
          some facilitator who some detainee
          seven years ago said might have been
          working with Al Qaeda?
          Maya is practically shaking with zealous rage at her inability
          to bend Bradley to her will.

                         MAYA
          He's the key to bin Laden.

                         BRADLEY
          I don't fucking care about bin Laden.
          I care about the next attack. You're
          going to start working on American
          Al Qaeda cells. Protect the homeland.

                         MAYA
          bin Laden is the one who keeps telling
          them to attack the homeland.

          If it wasn't for him, Al Qaeda would
          still be focused on overseas targets.
          If you really want to protect the
          homeland, you need to get bin Laden.

                         BRADLEY

                         (ANGRY)
          This guy never met bin Laden.
          This guy is a free lancer working
          off the fucking internet. No one
          has even talked to bin Laden in four
          years: he's out of the game, he may
          well even be dead but you know what
          you're doing? You're chasing a ghost
          while the whole fucking network grows
          all around you!
          For a moment she is silenced by Bradley's reprimand but then
          Maya's obsession speaks for her - and like a woman possessed
          she recklessly goes at him:

                         MAYA
          You just want me to nail some low
          level Mullah-crack-a-dulla so that
          you can check that box on your resume
          that says while you were in Pakistan
          you got a real terrorist. But the
          truth is you don't understand
          Pakistan, and you don't know Al Qaeda.
          Either give me the team I need to
          follow this lead, or the other thing
          you're gonna have on your resume is
          being the first Station Chief to be
          called before a congressional
          committee for subverting the efforts
          to capture or kill bin Laden.

                         BRADLEY
          You're fucking out of your mind.

                         MAYA
          I need four techs in a safe house in
          Rawalpindi and four techs in a safe
          house in Peshawar. Either send them
          out or send me back to DC and explain

          The question is, 'would he allow
          himself to be protected by the Paks?'
          I mean, why would he trust them? He
          tried to kill Musharaf.
          Steve considers a reply, but the meeting principals are filing
          in, including Daniel, and when Steve sees the CIA DIRECTOR
          enter the room, he clears the head of the table.

          and drive about forty-five minutes
          North, you'll find yourself here in
          Abbottabad. A middle class community -
          some ex-military - not particularly
          interesting to us. Except we did
          find this compound, which is unique.
          We got a sixteen foot wall around
          the entire perimeter, the windows
          are blacked out. It's a fortress.

          Can't you put a camera somewhere -
          in the trees - to get a look into
          the main house?

                         GEORGE
          It will probably be discovered.

          We have to get a look into the house.
          The Director moves to the satellite image.

          Another FIGURE comes out of the house and moves to the clothes-

          If there are three females, there
          ought to be three males. Observant
          Muslim women either live with parents
          or with their husbands. We think
          there's a third family living in the
          house.

          SUPERIMPOSE: SITUATION ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          So this third male that you've
          identified as possibly being bin
          Laden, do I just give up all hope of
          ever seeing a photograph of him?

                         GEORGE
          Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer.
          You give up your hope right now. We
          scanned for heat signatures, but we
          can't validate if it's a man or a
          woman up there. We found a safe
          house, but we can't get a vantage
          point to fire a telescope over the
          balcony wall.

          EXT. COMPOUND - ABBOTTABAD - MORNING

          A DOCTOR comes to the compound offering immunizations. One
          of the women let's him in, and he offers polio vaccines to
          the children.

                         GEORGE
          We talked about burrowing a pin hole
          camera but there's a high risk of
          discovery.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
          We have explored the possibility of
          digging tunnels, of sending hot air
          balloons, of re-routing supply C-
          130's to take a peek, but that might
          be too alerting. We've looked for
          ways of collecting available DNA
          from his trash - you know, looking
          for his toothbrush, but they burn
          the trash. We started a vaccination
          program, we sent a doctor to the
          house, to see if he could pull blood.
          A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the
          doctor away.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
          That didn't work out. We thought
          about sending a guy with a bucket to
          pull a sample from the sewer to
          analyze his fecal matter.

          SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR
          What was wrong with that, exactly?
          He looks up.

                         GEORGE
          What was wrong with that? The sample
          would be too diluted.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          And it's asking too much to get a
          voice confirmation with him on the
          phone?

                         GEORGE
          They don't make telephone calls from
          the compound. We pulled the cell
          tower nearby.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          And I'm also going to give up hope
          that he might ever get in that white
          SUV and drive around a bit and we
          could see him? Don't they get
          groceries.

                         GEORGE
          The unidentified third male does not
          get groceries. He does not leave
          the compound. He does not present
          himself for photographs.

          81.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
          When he needs fresh air, he paces
          around beneath a grape arbor, but
          the leaves are so thick they obscure
          our satellite views. This is a
          professional attempt to avoid
          detection - real tradecraft. The
          only people we've seen behave this
          way are other top level Al Qaeda
          operatives.
          The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant
          who slides a big folder across his desk to George.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          We did a Red Team on your analysis.
          According to them, this behavior
          could belong to someone other than
          Al Qaeda.

          DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          They did give a forty percent chance
          that the unidentified third man is a
          senior Al Qaeda operative. But they
          also said there's a thirty-five
          percent chance he's a Saudi drug

                         DEALER
          (reading from the

                         BINDER)
          A fifteen percent chance that he's a
          Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent
          chance that he's one of the relatives
          of the brothers.

          SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR
          Basically, we agree with you, the
          house screams security, it screams
          someone who wants privacy, it even
          screams 'bad guy', but it does not
          scream bin Laden.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          You get the point.

                         (BEAT)
          If you can't prove it's bin Laden,
          at least prove it's not somebody
          else, like a drug dealer.
          Beat.
          The meeting is adjourned.
          As they walk out --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         GEORGE
          You know we lost our ability to prove
          that when we lost the detainee
          program.

                         (BEAT)
          Who the hell am I supposed to ask?
          Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered
          up? He'll just tell his lawyer to
          warn bin Laden.

          He'd be the first successful drug
          dealer never to have dealt drugs.
          He has no internet access to the
          house. He makes no phone calls either
          in or out. Who's he selling to,
          who's he buying from, how's he making
          his money? And if you're going to
          say he's retired, I'd say where's
          his swimming pool, where's the gold
          cage with the falcons? And why does
          he send his courier to the two cities
          in Pakistan we most associate with
          Al Qaeda, that have nothing
          particularly to do with heroin

                         GEORGE
          I have to admit, I just don't get
          the rhythms of politics.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          You think this is political? If
          this was political we'd be having
          this conversation in October when
          there's an election bump. This is
          pure risk. Based on deductive
          reasoning, inference, supposition
          and the only human reporting you
          have is six years old, from detainees
          who are questioned under duress.
          The political move here is to tell
          you to go fuck yourself, and remind
          you that I was in the room when your
          old boss pitched WMD Iraq...at least
          there you guys brought photographs.

                         GEORGE
          You know, you're right, I agree with
          everything you just said. What I
          meant was, a man in your position,
          how do you evaluate the risk of not
          doing something, the risk of
          potentially letting bin Laden slip
          through your fingers?
          George shakes his head with an "aww shucks" kind of shake.

                         GENERAL
          I actually tried to kill this program
          a couple of times. They've gone
          through an initial round of testing,
          and they have excellent radar defeat -
          we just haven't tested them with
          people in them yet.

          - The rotors have been muffled with
          decibel killers - it's slower than a
          Blackhawk and lacks the offense.

          Excuse me. Can I ask a question?
          What do we need this for in Libya?
          Gaddafi's anti-air is virtually non-

                         MAYA
          There are two narratives about the
          location of Osama bin Laden.
          This registers on the SEALs.

                         MAYA (CONT'D)
          The one that you're most familiar
          with is that UBL is hiding in a cave
          in the Tribal Areas, that he's
          surrounded by a large contingent of
          loyal fighters.
          Beat.

                         MAYA (CONT'D)
          But that narrative is pre- 9/11
          understanding of UBL.
          The second narrative is that he's
          living in a city - living in a city
          with multiple points of egress and
          entries and with access to
          communications so that he can keep
          in touch with the organization. You
          can't run a global network of inter-
          connected cells from a cave.
          Beat.

                         MAYA (CONT'D)
          We've located an individual we believe
          based on detainee reporting is bin
          Laden's courier. He's living in a
          house in Abbottabod, Pakistan. And
          we assess that one of the other
          occupants of the house is UBL.

                         JUSTIN
          Excuse me. You got an intel source
          on the ground?

                         MAYA
          No.

          bin Laden? We've been on this op
          before, you know.

                         MAYA
          Bin Laden uses a courier to interact
          with the outside world. By locating
          the courier, we've located bin Laden.

                         PATRICK

          use you guys, with your dip and your
          velcro and all your gear bullshit.
          I wanted to drop a bomb but people
          didn't believe in this lead enough
          to drop a bomb, so they're using you
          guys as canaries on the theory that
          if bin Laden isn't there, you can
          sneak away and no one will be the
          wiser.

          I'm about to go look the President
          in the eye and what I'd like to know,
          no fucking bullshit, is where everyone
          stands on this thing. Now, very
          simply. Is he there or is he not
          fucking there?
          He looks to the Deputy Director.

                         DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          We all come at this through the filter
          of our own past experiences. I
          remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I
          fronted that and I can tell you the
          case for that was much stronger than
          this case.

          Yes or no.

                         DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          We don't deal in certainty, we deal
          in probability. I'd say there's a
          sixty percent probability he's there.
          The CIA Director points to Wolf.

                         WOLF
          I concur. Sixty percent.

                         GEORGE
          I'm at eighty percent. Their OPSEC
          is what convinces me.

                         CIA DIRECTOR
          You guys ever agree on anything?

                         DANIEL
          Well, I agree with sixty, we're basing
          this mostly on detainee reporting
          and I spent a bunch of time in those
          rooms - who knows?
          Maya shoots Daniel a look. What a traitor.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I'd say it's a soft sixty, sir. I'm
          virtually certain there's some high
          value target there, I'm just not
          sure it's bin Laden.
          The CIA Director leans back in his chair.

                         CIA DIRECTOR
          This is a cluster-fuck, isn't it?

                         JEREMY
          I'd like to know what Maya thinks.

                         DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          We're all incorporating her assessment
          into ours.
          Maya can't take it anymore:

                         MAYA
          One hundred percent, he's there -
          okay, fine, ninety-five percent
          because I know certainty freaks you
          guys out - but it's a hundred!

          of the girl?

          As the door closes.

          Maya is eating lunch by herself when she's startled to see
          the CIA Director standing by her table.

          May I join you?

          Twelve years. I was recruited out
          of high school.

                         CIA DIRECTOR
          Do you know why we did that?

                         MAYA
          I don't think I can answer that
          question, sir. I don't think I'm
          allowed to answer.

                         CIA DIRECTOR
          What else have you done for us besides
          bin Laden?

          Nothing. I've done nothing else.

          Maya smiles, laughs.

          Really? Okay. That's the kind of
          concrete data point I'm looking for.
          He shakes his head.

          that's keeping me from getting ass-

          The dust settles to reveal...a twisted wreck.
          PRINCE 51 has crash landed into a precarious position, with
          the back half of the helicopter wedged into the top of the
          wall and the front of it in the ground, leaving the passengers
          inside suspended more then ten feet off the ground.

          Patrick, Justin and SIX other SEALs cluster near the First
          Gate in the animal pen. One of the SEALs places a charge on
          the gate, while others check the Prayer Room.
          Boom! The charge partially blows open the metal swing doors
          of the gate, leaving a very narrow gap. Not ideal. The
          SEALs muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening
          in the jagged metal as the SNIPER climbs up on the roof of
          the prayer room.

          EXT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

          Patrick and Jared arrive at the guest house but can't see
          inside - the windows and doors are covered with sheets.
          Patrick kneels down to place a charge at the front door handle
          when the door erupts with gunfire
          - Bullets fly out of the wooden door. One skims Patrick's
          shoulder as he kneels lower. Patrick fires back at the house,
          putting a dozen rounds inside.
          A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle
          unlocks. ABU AHMED'S WIFE appears at the doorway and walks
          out.

          The Commanding Officer opens the gate and the other SEALs
          walk inside. As a group, they move towards the main house,
          arriving at the South side front door. The door is open and
          they enter -

          INT. MAIN HOUSE FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

          Piercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights,
          the SEALs advance slowly into the first floor hallway.
          Piles of household clutter, stacked high in bizarre shapes,
          greet them like the innards of a haunted house. One of the
          SEAL's catches movement: A figure with an AK-47 scrambling
          through clutter, then disappearing around a corner.

                         JUSTIN
          Abrar!
          The figure, Abu Ahmed's brother, ABRAR, re-appears at the
          end of the hallway. He pokes his head out -

          her body.
          - Justin shoots her. She falls...Abrar is underneath her -
          he is still breathing, gasping and
          - Justin shoots him again, silencing him
          - Then looks to his wife and assesses her condition
          - Badly wounded, faint breathing, life fading from her eyes...

          Justin and a BREACHER proceed down the hall to the heavy
          gate that blocks access to the stairway while another SEAL
          stays behind. Somewhere, children are screaming.

                         JUSTIN
          Shut those fucking kids up.
          O.S. the kids quiet down.

          Saber waits with his carbine raised. Anxiety crosses his

          Khaled hears his name being called from below. A few feet
          away from him in the dimly lit hall is a loaded AK-47. He
          goes to the gun and picks it up.
          He hears his name again, "Khaled!" And the voice sounds
          friendly, urgent.
          Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled
          puts the gun down, resting it against a wall, and turns and
          heads back to the sound of his name.
          Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the
          stairway and fires - killing him instantly.
          Saber pushes past the body, Patrick following, and they climb

          on the tail of the helicopter, when suddenly his foot slips,
          piercing the tail's thin skin, and he nearly falls off.
          He manages to place a last charge - but the remainder of the
          tail piece will not be detonated.
