               FADE IN:

               EXT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT

               Framed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER, 
               alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy 
               satin curtains close, wiping him from view.

               INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One 
               pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the 
               opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some 
               anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual 
               orgy. 

               GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, 
               is curled up beside him. 

               SID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control, 
               has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother. 

               Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair. 

               Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting 
               turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged 
               leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his 
               touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand.

                                     GERALD
                              (removing the cigar 
                              from his mouth)
                         Bollock naked with his socks still 
                         on?

                                     SID
                              (thoughtfully)
                         They do that up North.

                                     GERALD
                         What for? Protective purposes?

               He laughs.

                                     SID
                         Ask me?

                                     GERALD
                         Ask Jack. It's his old stamping 
                         ground.

               Carter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet. Lights 
               and sweet music happen when he opens it. 

               Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     SID
                         Must be a bloody contortionist

               Still looking at the screen, Gerald continues.

                                     GERALD
                         We don't want you to go up the 
                         North, Jack.

               Jack and Anna look at each other momentarily. There is 
               definitely something between them. 

                                     JACK
                         No.  

               Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     GERALD
                              (groans)
                         Not suede boots!  

                                     SID
                         Knock it off, Gerald.

                                     GERALD
                         What? And get the clap?  

               Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     GERALD
                         You work for us, Jack. We have 
                         connections in those parts.  I'd 
                         hate you to screw 'em up.  

               Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     GERALD
                         What's that? A python.  

               Sid laughs raucously.  Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     GERALD
                         What are you going for?  

                                     JACK 
                         To find out what happened.  

               Clunk. The slide changes. 

                                     GERALD
                         Some hard nuts operate up there, 
                         Jack. They won't take kindly to 
                         someone from London poking his 
                         bugle in. 

                                     JACK
                         Too bad. 

                                     GERALD
                         I smell trouble, boy.  

               Clunk. The slide changes. 

                                     SID
                         The law was satisfied. 

                                     JACK
                         Since when was that good enough?  

               Clunk. The slide changes. 

                                     GERALD
                         Think again, Jack.

                                     JACK
                         I will.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY

               Express train plunges into a tunnel Blackness. 

               BEGIN TITLES:

               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

               The compartment is full. Jack Carter sits in one corner, 
               reading a Raymond Chandler paperback, Farewell My Lovely.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY

               The train speeds northwards. In the distance the stacks of 
               a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown 
               smoke.

               INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - DAY

               Carter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY

               A massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past. Its 
               mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect.

               INT. TRAIN TOILET - DAY

               Carter tips his head back and dispenses drops into his 
               nose.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - EVENING

               The train breaks from another tunnel. Evening light cuts 
               across the track as the train hurtles on.

               INT. TRAIN RESTAURANT CAR - EVENING

               Carter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small 
               phial of brown pills. He swallows one.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - NIGHT

               A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the 
               outskirts of the city appear.

               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               The train moves slowly along the platform and stops. Carter 
               collects his coat and briefcase from the rack.

               EXT. NEWCASTLE STATION - NIGHT

               The street is fairly deserted.  

               Carter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses 
               and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite.

               INT. THE LONG BAR - NIGHT

               A couple of youths are playing records on the juke box. An 
               old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper.  

               Carter enters through the swing door and a weedy BARMAN 
               comes to serve him.

                                     CARTER
                         Pint of bitter.

               The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the 
               beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him.

                                     CARTER
                         In a thin glass.  

               The barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a 
               thin glass and puts it on the counter.

               A telephone rings. The second barman answers it. 

                                     BARMAN
                         Is there a Mr Carter in the room? 

                                     CARTER
                         Yes.

               Carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the 
               receiver.

                                     CARTER
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Margaret?
                              (pause)
                         Why the hell aren't you here?
                              (he lights a 
                              cigarette.)
                         What time?
                              (pause)
                         Is Doreen at the house?
                              (pause)
                         Who's with him then?
                              (pause)
                         When can I see you? Will you be 
                         there tomorrow?
                              (pause)
                         Now listen, Margaret...  

               The line goes dead. Carter hangs up.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

               A key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards 
               and out through the flap. A moment later, the door opens. 
               Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in 
               a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs 
               the stairs.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT 

               Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling 
               wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits 
               an unseen bucket with depressing regularity.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a 
               dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a 
               vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the 
               ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking 
               up. They see him and quickly drive off.

               Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's 
               an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories 
               flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of 
               cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He 
               leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Pitch black.

               An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK 
               CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his 
               skin made-up, like porcelain.

               Carter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his 
               brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. 
               He exits, turning out the light and closing the door. 

               Darkness returns.

               INT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

               The landlady, EDNA GARFOOT, is climbing the stairs. She's 
               well built, sexy, experienced. Carter follows with his 
               baggage. He watches her appreciatively from behind.

                                     CARTER
                         I won't be using the room tonight.

                                     EDNA
                              (stops and turns)
                         I see.

                                     CARTER
                         I'm staying with a friend.

                                     EDNA
                              (continuing up the 
                              stairs)
                         Her husband docks tomorrow, does 
                         he?  

                                     CARTER
                              (smiles)
                         It's not like that, luv.

                                     EDNA
                         It never is.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The door opens and the light goes on. It's a big room 
               overlooking the road, furnished cheaply but comfortably. 

               Edna and Carter enter, talking. 

                                     EDNA
                         Are you a traveller?  

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         Definitely.

                                     EDNA
                              (surveying the room)
                         Will this do?  

                                     CARTER
                              (looking around)
                         Very nice. (He takes his wallet 
                         out.) I'll pay you for tonight as 
                         well.

                                     EDNA
                         Don't be bloody silly. You're the 
                         first since Monday.

                                     CARTER
                         You sure?  

               Carter gives her the money.

                                     EDNA
                         Ta.

                                     CARTER
                              (feeling the mattress)
                         I'll bet this one's seen some 
                         action.

               Carter smiles and looks straight at her. Edna returns his 
               look, dead pan.

                                     EDNA
                         I'll give you the key when you 
                         come down.

               She closes the door.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Carter moves around the coffin as he shaves. His electric 
               razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The coffin lid is being screwed down.  

               Carter stirs a cup of instant coffee while watching the 
               undertakers at work.  

                                     CARTER
                         Was he in bad shape?  

                                     UNDERTAKER
                         They come worse.

               INT. HEARSE - DAY

               The hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses. A 
               youthful UNDERTAKER is minding it. He turns and looks 
               through the back window as a young girl walks up the street. 

               DOREEN CARTER is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, 
               tries to look older. She wears all the right gear but it's 
               cheap and doesn't fit properly. Her long hair is lank.  
               There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance. 
               The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The door opens slowly. Doreen stands there looking at the 
               coffin. Carter sees her.

                                     CARTER
                         Doreen?  

               She seems mesmerized by what's going on.

                                     CARTER
                         All right, are you?  

               Doreen doesn 't answer.

                                     CARTER
                         Been staying with a friend?  

               Doreen nods. The undertaker coughs and thrusts another 
               screw into the coffin.

                                     CARTER
                         Sorry about your father.

                                     DOREEN
                              (pause)
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         Tell me, Doreen, did the police 
                         say anything?

                                     DOREEN
                              (dazed)
                         They said he was drunk.

               INT. HEARSE - DAY

               The young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to 
               the radio. In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover 
               moving slowly tip the road. It stops by the house. Two men 
               suss the scene and drive off.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                     CARTER
                         How's school?  

                                     DOREEN
                         I left last year.

                                     CARTER
                         Oh, what you doing now?  

                                     DOREEN
                         Working at Woolworths. 

                                     CARTER
                         That must be interesting.

                                     DOREEN
                         Yes.

               Carter and Doreen look at each other awkwardly.

                                     CARTER
                         What you going to do? Live with 
                         Margaret? 

               Doreen looks at him nervously, shakes her head and fumbles 
               in her bag for a cigarette.

               Carter continues, slightly indignant.

                                     CARTER
                         Well, why won't you come with us 
                         to South America? My fiancee won't 
                         mind,
                              (pause)
                         Your dad would have wanted it.  

               The undertaker puts the final screw in.

                                     UNDERTAKER
                              (to colleague)
                         Get Hughbert up, will you?
                              (to Carter)
                         We're ready now, sir.

               EXT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - DAY

               The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow 
               staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait 
               with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing 
               a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a 
               young barman who worked with Frank.

                                     EDDIE
                         We weren't sure where it was taking 
                         place, like.

                                     CARTER
                         Nice of you to come.

                                     EDDIE
                         No. Frank was a good bloke.

                                     KEITH
                         He was that.

                                     EDDIE
                         One of the best.

               INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

               Through the windscreen of the following limousine Carter 
               can see his brother's coffin in the hearse as it moves 
               slowly through the streets of the city. Sitting in front 
               on fold-out seats are Eddie and Keith.

                                     KEITH
                         I couldn't believe it when I heard.  
                         Carter is suddenly attentive.

                                     CARTER
                         What?  

                                     KEITH
                         I mean, I was surprised when he 
                         didn't turn up for work.  He was 
                         always on time.

                                     CARTER
                         Did you work with him, Keith?  

                                     KEITH
                         At the Half Moon.

                                     EDDIE
                              (not to be left out)
                         It's a bloody funny thing. You 
                         know a bloke for six bloody years 
                         and all the time he's as calm as 
                         gentle Jesus...
                              (pause)
                         ...then he goes and does a thing 
                         like that.
                              (he shakes his head.)
                         It's a bloody funny thing.

                                     CARTER
                              (quietly)
                         Yeah. A bloody funny thing!

               EXT. CREMATORIUM GATES - DAY

               As the cortege drives into the crematorium, it passes the 
               Land Rover parked outside. The same two men who passed 
               Frank's house are in it. A long and expensive-looking 
               funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway.

               INT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

               Carter, Doreen, Eddie and Keith are in the front pews facing 
               the catafalque on which Frank's coffin rests. The vicar is 
               already midway through the solemn words of the 'committal' 
               when a woman enters. The clunk of her high heels cuts 
               through the silence. Everybody looks round.

                                     CARTER
                              (whispering to Doreen)
                         Is that Margaret?  

               Doreen nods. Frank's coffin sinks out of sight.

               INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY

               Two men in long grey coats wait in silence. The coffin 
               appears. Expertly, they take it and swing it on to a 
               trolley. They push it up the wide corridor towards the 
               furnace. One of the men starts whistling cheerfully.

               EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

               MARGARET is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind 
               of way.  Her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap 
               pair of sunglasses. She walks quickly away, down the 
               cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns.  

               Carter comes out of the chapel and sees her.

                                     CARTER
                         Margaret.

               Margaret stops and looks round. Carter joins her.  I thought 
               you weren't coming.

                                     MARGARET
                         Changed me mind.

               They face each other in silence. Margaret looks past Carter 
               and sees Doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters. 
               She turns away and starts walking slowly. Carter moves 
               with her.  Margaret continues nervously.

                                     MARGARET
                         Everyhing go off all right? 

                                     CARTER
                         Fine...
                              (pause)
                         I want to talk to you. 

                                     MARGARET
                         What about?

                                     CARTER
                         Doreen. 

               Margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at Doreen. 
               She's still watching them.

                                     MARGARET
                              (adamantly)
                         She's nothing to do with me. 

                                     CARTER
                              (puzzled)
                         What do you mean? You've been 
                         Frank's bird ever since her mother 
                         cleared off. You're closer to her 
                         than anyone.

                                     MARGARET
                              (shaking her head)
                         No. No. It's not like that. I've 
                         got a husband, you know.

               Margaret starts walking again, fast.  

               Carter catches hold of her arm and stops her.

                                     CARTER
                         Hold it!   Hold it!
                              (looking her in the 
                              eye)
                         Who killed Frank, Margaret?

                                     MARGARET
                              (nervously)
                         Killed?  I don't know anything 
                         about it.

               She moves off rapidly. Carter catches up with her.

                                     CARTER
                         Really.

                                     MARGARET
                         I must go. I'm in a hurry.

                                     CARTER
                         I want to talk to you later.

                                     MARGARET
                         I can't.

                                     CARTER
                         Tomorrow morning, then?  

               Margaret dithers.

                                     MARGARET
                         Well, all right then. Twelve o'clock 
                         on the Iron Bridge.

               Margaret walks off as calmly as she can, her high heels 
               clicking as she goes. Carter watches her disappear. Doreen 
               watches too.

               INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY

               Frank's coffin is slid inside the furnace. Flames start to 
               lick it as the steel trap closes.

               INT. THE HALF MOON PUB - DAY

               It's a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre, a 
               real boozer.  A handful of hard drinkers are already in 
               position.

               Carter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone. Their 
               table is already covered with glasses. Doreen appears to 
               be slightly drunk on Babycham, Eddie on whisky and Keith 
               on beer. Carter is stone-cold sober.

                                     EDDIE
                         Absent friends.
                              (He raises his glass 
                              and drinks, then 
                              continues 
                              thoughtfully.)
                         You don't think he might have done 
                         it on purpose?

                                     KEITH
                         What? You mean, like, kill himself?  

               Eddie and Keith look at each other.

               Doreen watches them. She is getting very upset by the 
               conversation.

                                     KEITH
                         Naw. Frank? Kill himself? You what?  

               Carter stares at Keith, who is getting uncomfortable.

                                     KEITH
                         I mean, what for?  

                                     CARTER
                         That's what I was wondering.

                                     KEITH
                         Come off it. Frank was... well... 
                         straight. He had no worries I know. 
                         Hell, we worked together every day 
                         for a year. It would have showed.

                                     CARTER
                         Why would it?  

                                     KEITH
                         It just would. He was always the 
                         same.

                                     CARTER
                         Since when did he drink whisky?  

                                     KEITH
                         Don't know.

                                     CARTER
                         Nobody seems to know.

               Doreen is now crying openly.

                                     EDDIE
                              (finishing off his 
                              drink)
                         Bloody good bloke. One of the best.

                                     DOREEN
                              (blurts out)
                         How would you know?
                              (She suddenly jumps 
                              up and empties her 
                              glass in Eddie's 
                              face.)
                         Or you?  Or you? None of you knew.  
                         I knew. He was me dad.

               She runs off out of the door crying. Keith goes to follow.  
               Carter puts his hand out to restrain him.

                                     CARTER
                         Let her go. She'll be OK.
                              (to Eddie)
                         Sorry about that.

                                     EDDIE
                              (wiping his face 
                              with a handkerchief)
                         Don't worry. She's bound to be 
                         upset.

                                     CARTER
                              (to Eddie)
                         Have another?  

                                     EDDIE
                         No. I'll be off now. I should be 
                         at work.

               Eddie stands up, cap in hand. Carter pulls out a wad of 
               money.

                                     CARTER
                         Look, look.
                              (He peels off a 
                              note.)
                         Get your suit cleaned.

                                     EDDIE
                         No. It's all right.

                                     CARTER
                              (standing, pushes 
                              the note in his 
                              top pocket)
                         Thanks for coming.

                                     EDDIE
                         Frank was a good bloke. It's the 
                         least I could have done.

               Eddie leaves.

                                     CARTER
                         You work here, Keith?  

                                     KEITH
                         Yes.

               Carter thinks for a moment, then leans forward to Keith. 

                                     CARTER
                         Keith, if anybody comes in here 
                         and asks for me, you let me know. 
                         Right?  

                                     KEITH
                         Right.

                                     CARTER
                         I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the 
                         dance hall.
                              (He casts an eye 
                              around the bar.)
                         Do you know a man called Albert 
                         Swift?

                                     KEITH
                         Yeah. He comes in here a bit.

                                     CARTER
                         Where would I find him?

                                     KEITH
                         Today? At the races. He always 
                         goes.

               Carter takes out his phial of pills.

                                     KEITH
                         How'd you know Albert?

                                     CARTER
                         Went to school with him.
                              (smiles)
                         He was leader of our gang. He'll 
                         know what's going on in this town.

               EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY

               The rain has just stopped. Bookies and punters lower their 
               umbrellas. Horses thunder towards the finishing post. Turf 
               flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts 
               in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars.

               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY

               Albert Swift is standing by a bookmaker's marking bis race 
               card with a biro. A hot dog is sticking out of his mouth, 
               like a cigar. A man of about thirty-five, be appears much 
               older, probably from an excess of booze and women. He looks 
               up, and his mouth drops open, the hot dog falling to the 
               ground. He has seen Carter.

               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY

               Carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies, all 
               the time looking about him. The track loudspeaker announces 
               the winner of the last race.

               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY

               Albert pales. He holds his race card in front of his face 
               and disappears into the crowd. As he moves off, his foot 
               steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out.

               EXT. TRACK SADDLING ENCLOSURE - DAY

               Carter stands alone, casting an eye over the punters. His 
               eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring 
               ERIC PAICE.  Dressed in a grey chauffeur's uniform, cap, 
               dark glasses and gloves, he is standing close to three 
               well-heeled-looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks.

               Horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure.  
               Carter approaches from behind. He looks at Eric closely 
               before speaking.

                                     CARTER
                         Grey suits you, Eric.

               Eric swings round, startled.

                                     ERIC
                         Good God!

               Carter smiles.

                                     CARTER
                         Is he?

                                     ERIC
                         Jack Carter.

                                     CARTER
                              (amused)
                         Eric. Eric Paice.

                                     ERIC
                         What you doing around here then?

                                     CARTER
                         Didn't you know this is my home 
                         town?

                                     ERIC
                         No, I didn't know that.

                                     CARTER
                         Funny, that.

               Carter takes out his cigarettes. Eric takes one.

                                     ERIC
                         Thanks. So what're you doing? On 
                         your holidays?

                                     CARTER
                         No. I'm visiting relatives.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, that's nice.

                                     CARTER
                         It would be. If they were still 
                         living.

                                     ERIC
                         Meaning what?  

                                     CARTER
                         A bereavement. A death in the 
                         family.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

                                     CARTER
                         That's all right, Eric.

               Carter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light.

                                     ERIC
                         Well, well. Small world, isn't it?

                                     CARTER
                         Very...
                              (pause)
                         So, who you working for these days 
                         Eric?

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, I'm straight.
                              (indicating uniform)
                         Respectable.

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         What are you doing? Advertising 
                         Martini?

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, you've been watching television.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah,
                              (pause)
                         Come off it, Eric. Who is it?

               Eric smiles back.  

                                     CARTER
                         Brumby?

               Eric shakes his head.

                                     CARTER
                         Kinnear?

               Eric shakes his head

                                     ERIC
                         What's it to you anyway? 

                                     CARTER
                         I've always ad your welfare at 
                         heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm 
                         nosy.

                                     ERIC
                         That's not always a healthy way to 
                         be...

                                     CARTER
                         And you should know, if I remember 
                         rightly.

               A track announcement interrupts them.

                                     CARTER
                         So you're doing all right then, 
                         Eric. You're making good. 

                                     ERIC
                         Making a living.

                                     CARTER
                         Good prospects for advancement, is 
                         there? A pension?
                              (He can't resist it 
                              any longer. He 
                              lifts the sunglasses 
                              off Eric's nose 
                              and looks into his 
                              eyes.)
                         Do you know, I'd almost forgotten 
                         what your eyes looked like.

               Eric stares back.

                                     CARTER
                         They're still the same. Piss holes 
                         in the snow.

                                     ERIC
                         Still got a sense of humour?

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, I retained that, Eric.
                              (He moves towards 
                              the saddling ring 
                              and turns to Eric.)
                         Do you know a man called Albert 
                         Swift, Eric?

                                     ERIC
                         Can't say I do.

               Carter looks across at the track.

                                     CARTER
                         Don't miss the start on my account.

               EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY

               Starting gates slam open and the horses leap out.

               INT. HIRE CAR - AFTERNOON

               Carter is driving along a country road. Ahead, two cars 
               are between him and a Cadillac with dark-tinted windows. 
               The Cadillac turns on to a minor road. Carter follows.

               INT. CADILLAC - LATE AFTERNOON

               Eric Paice is driving. In the back sit the three men seen 
               with him at the race track. The drinks compartment is open 
               and they are helping themselves to champagne. Racing results 
               come over the car radio.

               INT. HIRE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

               Carter follows the Cadillac at a safe distance. It turns 
               into a driveway. Carter slows down and reads a sign by the 
               entrance: The Heights. 

               He drives on and parks.

               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON

               Carter comes through a wooded area. He pauses by a lake, 
               now overgrown with weeds. A big man stands tossing stones 
               into the water. Carter silently picks up a dead branch 
               then runs at the man. Carter whacks him on the head and he 
               collapses unconscious into the lake. Carter moves on towards 
               the house. MARTY and RAY the two men previously seen in 
               the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious 
               lawn fronting the house. It's a Victorian building 
               surrounded by acres of woodland.

               Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door. 
               One of the men notices and shouts after him.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON

               Carter runs into the house and slips into a small service 
               room. Ray and then Marty charge inside but miss seeing 
               Carter.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               A game of poker is in progress. Seated around the table 
               are the three men with Eric at the race track. With them 
               is an elegant man, CYRIL KINNEAR. On the sofa are GLENDA, 
               a sexy-looking young woman, and Eric Paice.

               Ray bursts in. 

                                     RAY
                         Carter's here.

               Eric jumps up.

                                     ERIC
                         Where? 

                                     RAY
                         I don't know.

                                     ERIC
                         You stupid shit! 

               Carter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss.

               Kinnear watches with some amusement.

                                     KINNEAR
                         You see what it's like these days, 
                         Jack.  You can't get the material.

               Carter looks at Eric.

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, I can see your problem, Mr 
                         Kinnear.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Sit down, Jack,
                              (pause)
                         I could weep. I really could.  
                         Sometimes I think I'll retire. 
                         Just piss off to the Bahamas and 
                         let somebody else employ them,
                              (to girl)
                         Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is 
                         it, Jack?

                                     CARTER
                              (to Glenda)
                         Scotch, please.

                                     KINNEAR
                              (to bouncer)
                         Piss off, Ray.

               Ray closes the door behind him.

               Glenda brings Carter his Scotch. He looks at her as she 
               sits beside him.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Eric told me of your bereavement.

                                     CARTER
                         Yep.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Do you know, I never knew he worked 
                         in one of my places!

                                     CARTER
                         No? Funny that. Neither did I.

                                     KINNEAR
                         If I'd known, I'd have fixed him 
                         up with something better.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Nasty way to go.

                                     CARTER
                         Yes.

               One of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear 
               gets impatient. PETER, LES AND HARRY are well-heeled, middle-
               aged, northern businessmen.

                                     HARRY
                         Are we here to play cards or talk 
                         about the old days? 

                                     KINNEAR
                         Harry! Jack, I don't want to be 
                         rude, but these men have brought a 
                         lot of money with them. Glenda, 
                         you don't offer a man like Jack a 
                         drink in those piddling little 
                         glasses.  Give him the bloody 
                         bottle.
                              (He picks up his 
                              cards.)
                         Now, where are we?

               Harry keeps a cold, wary eye on him.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.

                                     HARRY
                              (shaken)
                         You're bluffing, you bastard!

                                     KINNEAR
                         That's what you pay to find out. 
                         Right, Jack?

                                     CARTER
                         Right. If you can afford it.

                                     HARRY
                              (to Carter)
                         Thought you were going soon.

                                     CARTER
                         Soon. When you've lost your money. 
                         Won't take long. 

                                     HARRY
                         Clever sod, aren't you?  

                                     CARTER
                         Only comparatively.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Harry, I don't like to push, but 
                         could you let us know how much 
                         your hand's worth?

               Harry looks at his cards. Glenda tucks her legs up, making 
               sure that Carter gets an eyeful.

                                     GLENDA
                         You know Sid Fletcher?

                                     CARTER
                         What?  

                                     GLENDA
                         You know Sid Fletcher? 

                                     CARTER
                         I work for him.

                                     GLENDA
                         Do you?

                                     CARTER
                              (amused)
                         Yes, I do.

               Carter looks back at the table. Kinnear pushes in some 
               money.

                                     HARRY
                         What's that? A hundred?

                                     KINNEAR
                         That's right, Harry.

                                     HARRY
                         Your hundred, and another hundred.

               Kinnear lays more cash on the table.

                                     HARRY
                         What's that?

                                     KINNEAR
                         That, Harry? That's another hundred - 
                         twenty-five pounds notes of the 
                         realm.

                                     HARRY
                         Three hundred altogether?

                                     KINNEAR
                         Three hundred altogether, Harry.

               Glenda attracts Carter's attention again.

                                     GLENDA
                         I know him too.

                                     CARTER
                         Who? 

                                     GLENDA
                         Sid Fletcher.

                                     CARTER
                              (sending her up)
                         Oh, do you?

                                     GLENDA
                              (dumb)
                         Yes.

                                     CARTER
                         No, do you really? 

               Carter turns to the table yet again.

               Harry nervously puts another hundred on the table. Kinnear 
               purses his lips. 

                                     KINNEAR
                         I'll follow that and go two hundred.

               Harry looks sick.

                                     KINNEAR
                         You can always see me, Harry.

               Harry sweats and then smiles nervously.

                                     HARRY
                         All right. Two hundred.

                                     KINNEAR
                              (raises an eyebrow)
                         Ha.

               Kinnear takes a wad of notes out of his pocket. Glenda, 
               shifts herself on the sofa.

                                     GLENDA
                         Yes. I met him last year.

                                     CARTER
                         Go on.

                                     GLENDA
                         Oh yes. When he came up on business.

                                     CARTER
                         Really?

                                     GLENDA
                         He came to see Mr Kinnear.

                                     CARTER
                         No.

               Carter, getting bored, looks back at the game.

                                     HARRY
                              (panicking)
                         What's that?

                                     KINNEAR
                         That's six hundred pounds, Harry. 
                         Two hundred to follow you, and 
                         I've raised it four hundred.

               Harry sweats some more.

                                     HARRY
                         Four hundred?

                                     KINNEAR
                         That's right.

                                     HARRY
                         You're not seeing me?

                                     KINNEAR
                         No.

               Harry smiles nervously. He counts some money out.

                                     HARRY
                         I'll see you, then.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?

               Harry nods.

               Glenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the 
               table. Kinnear lays out his hand  a hearts flush, queen 
               high.

                                     GLENDA
                         We went about together.

                                     CARTER
                         Really?

                                     GLENDA
                         Yes, while he was here.

                                     CARTER
                         While he was here. You went about 
                         together?

                                     GLENDA
                         He was here for four days.

                                     CARTER
                         Was he? 

                                     GLENDA
                         Could you do me a favour?  

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah, I'll do you a favour.

                                     GLENDA
                         Could you please put my glass on 
                         the table? 

               Carter smiles and does just that.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Oh, come on, Harry. I haven't won, 
                         have I? Go on, you're pulling my 
                         leg.

               Kinnear leans across to pick up Harry's cards. Harry grabs 
               them and puts them in the pack. Kinnear turns to Carter.

                                     KINNEAR
                         How about that, Jack?  Old Harry 
                         thought I was having him on.

                                     HARRY
                         Shut up.

               Carter gets up from the sofa.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Not going, Jack? 

                                     CARTER
                         I have to. Things to see to.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Of course, of course. Well, any 
                         time, just drop by.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah, I'll do that.
                              (He points at Harry.)
                         Told you it wouldn't take long, 
                         didn't I? 

               Eric opens the door and follows him out.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - HALLWAY - EVENING

               Carter moves towards the front door.

                                     ERIC
                         Jack! I didn't like that.

                                     CARTER
                         You should have told me who you 
                         were working for. 

                                     ERIC
                         Cyril didn't like it, either.

                                     CARTER
                         Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls 
                         together, is it?

                                     ERIC
                         He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't 
                         like it much when they hear you've 
                         been sticking your nose in.

               Carter carries on walking to the front door. He opens it. 

                                     CARTER
                         He's right. Tell him to save the 
                         cost of the phone call.

               Carter leaves. Eric signals Ray to follow him.

               EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY

               Huge metal claw catches hold of an old car and lifts it 
               like it was a toy. The yard is beside the River Tyne. In 
               the distance a train crosses the Iron Bridge.

               Carter is examining a beaten-up Hillman when the yard owner, 
               BILLY LAWS, approaches.

                                     BILLY
                              (suspicious)
                         What do you want?

                                     CARTER
                         What happened to this car? 

                                     BILLY
                         What's it got to do with you? 

                                     CARTER
                         This is my brother's car.

                                     BILLY
                         Oh ay?

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah.

                                     BILLY
                         Well, he drove it into the river.

                                     CARTER
                         Was the steering faulty? 

               Billy shakes his head.

                                     CARTER
                         What about the brakes?  

                                     BILLY
                         Fine. Nowt wrong with them.

                                     CARTER
                         How'd it happen, then?

                                     BILLY
                         He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.

                                     CARTER
                         Was he?

               INT. THE HALF MOON - NIGHT

               A big, busty pub singer is performing on the small stage. 
               A trio on her right plays a good, grinding, up-tempo number.  

               Carter comes through the door. He pushes his way through 
               the packed drunken crowd to the bar. Keith serves him. 

                                     KEITH
                         What you having, Jack? 

                                     CARTER
                         Large Scotch.

               Carter watches the singer. The customers cheer and whistle.  
               Keith returns with the Scotch. He looks nervously around 
               and speaks to Carter quietly.

                                     KEITH
                         Heard of a man called Thorpe? 

                                     CARTER
                         Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a 
                         long time.

                                     KEITH
                              (picking up Carter's 
                              money)
                         That's what he was saying about 
                         you.

               Keith takes the money to the till. The music grinds away.  
               Keith returns.

                                     KEITH
                         Said he'd heard you were up in 
                         town. Wondered if I knew where you 
                         was staying. Wanted to look you 
                         up. Old time's sake.

                                     CARTER
                         That's nice. What'd you tell him?  

                                     KEITH
                         Nowt.

                                     CARTER
                         Good lad.

               Carter watches the singer, then finishes his drink.

                                     CARTER
                         See you later.

                                     KEITH
                         Where you off to?

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         Las Vegas.

               Carter makes for the door. The singer is now moving through 
               the tables. She pauses to give some man a kiss. Everybody 
               cheers.

               The woman sitting with the man snaps. She picks up his 
               glass of beer and throws it over the singer; then grabs 
               her hair and pulls her to the ground.

               Carter stops to watch. The two women roll on the floor, 
               punching and scratching.

               Carter smiles and leaves.

               EXT. ALLEY IN TOWN CENTRE - NIGHT

               On the corner is a neon-lit snack bar. Doreen and another 
               young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes. Somewhere 
               a drunk is singing. His voice echoes up the alley.

               Carter draws alongside and notices Doreen. He stops and 
               watches her. She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window 
               and knocks on it. She looks up and he beckons her outside. 
               Reluctantly, she comes.

                                     CARTER
                              (gently)
                         You all right now?

                                     DOREEN
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         You coming to South America?

                                     DOREEN
                         No.

               Carter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection. 

                                     CARTER
                         Where you going to live, then? 

                                     DOREEN
                         At me friend's house.

                                     CARTER
                         Where's that?

                                     DOREEN
                         Wilton Estate.

                                     CARTER
                         Nice family, are they? Church-goers 
                         and all that?

               Doreen nods.

                                     CARTER
                         Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't 
                         suppose I'll see you again.
                              (He pulls out a wad 
                              of money, and peels 
                              off some notes.)
                         There. Go and get your hair done.

                                     DOREEN
                              (Can't believe it)
                         Thanks.

               He lifts her chin with his finger and looks at her.

                                     CARTER
                         Be good. And don't trust boys.

               Doreen blushes and turns away. She rushes back to the snack 
               bar with the money to show her friend.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               The front door opens and Carter enters.

               Standing on the hall table is a small wooden casket with 
               an envelope taped to it. Carter pockets the envelope and 
               picks up the casket.  

                                     EDNA (O.S.)
                         That was left for you this evening. 

               Carter walks past her into the sitting room.

                                     EDNA
                         What is it?

                                     CARTER
                         My brother, Frank.

                                     EDNA
                         Is he staying the night?  

                                     CARTER
                         Funny.
                              (He puts the casket 
                              on a side table.)
                         Can I phone London?

                                     EDNA
                         It'll cost you.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Anna is undressing. She's alone. Pulling the short black-
               silk underslip over her head, she stands in front of a 
               long mirror, clad only in black panties, bra and tights. 
               She looks at herself appreciatively. The phone rings. She 
               flops on the bed and picks up the receiver.

                                     ANNA
                         Hello.

               A voice speaks on the end of the line.

                                     ANNA
                         How I miss you.
                              (She stretches 
                              herself out sexily 
                              and smiles.)
                         Stop it, darling.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               It's a cosy room. Carter is on the telephone. EDNA sits in 
               a rocking chair.

                                     CARTER
                              (looking at Edna)
                         I fancy you. I wish I was touching 
                         you right now...

               Edna turns towards him. Carter fixes her with his eyes. 
               Edna rocks herself gently. Carter continues softly.

                                     CARTER
                         ...making love to you. I want to 
                         stroke you and kiss you all over. 
                         Where are you?

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Anna is lying full-length on the bed.

                                     ANNA
                         In the bedroom.

               Carter speaks on the other end.

                                     ANNA
                         My black underwear.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Edna rocks backwards and forwards. 

                                     CARTER
                              (quietly)
                         The sexy, silk ones?  

               Anna replies. He continues softly.

                                     CARTER
                         Take your bra off.
                              (pause)
                         No, go on.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

               Anna unhooks her bra. There's a flash of breasts.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               The scene as before.

                                     CARTER
                         Now hold them. Gently.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Anna's hands cover her breasts. Her head moves slowly from 
               side to side, eyes closed.

                         Slowly. Imagine it's me.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Anna's hand caresses the inside of her leg. Her head rolls 
               from side to side slowly. She's breathing heavily.

               CROSS-CUT between Edna's head rocking backwards and forwards 
               and Anna's head moving from side to side.

                                     CARTER (V.O.)
                         When we're in South America, we'll 
                         make love in the sun. Roll over... 
                         and make love again... and again... 
                         For me... I fancy you...

               THE SPEED OF THE CUTTING BUILDS.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Suddenly the door opens and Gerald comes in. He sees Anna 
               groaning on the bed.

                                     GERALD
                         What's the matter? You got gut 
                         trouble or something?

               Anna sits up abruptly and puts her hand over the receiver. 

                                     ANNA
                         No, darling. Just doing some 
                         exercises,
                              (into telephone)
                         Listen, Janet, Gerald's just got 
                         in, so I must ring off.
                              (pause)
                         Yes. Yes. I'll come tomorrow.

                                     CARTER
                         Save it till Sunday. I'll be back 
                         then.

               Carter replaces the receiver. He still holds Edna's eyes. 
               She rocks to and fro. The rocker creaks.

               The front door bell breaks the mood.

                                     CARTER
                         That'll be for me.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

               Carter opens the door. Keith is outside. He's sweating. 
               His tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his 
               suit is covered with dirt.

                                     KEITH
                         Thorpey. They were waiting for us 
                         in the car park. 

                                     CARTER
                         How many?

                                     KEITH
                         Four of them.

               Carter pulls Keith inside and turns out the light. 

               A Ford Zodiac comes along the road. It stops. Four faces 
               peer into the darkness where they're standing. Nobody gets 
               out. The back window winds down. Thorpe's nervous voice 
               floats out.

                                     THORPE
                         Jack? 

                                     CARTER
                         Good evening.

                                     THORPE
                         I'd like a word with you, Jack.

                                     CARTER
                         That's nice.

                                     THORPE
                         Confidential, like.

                                     CARTER
                         You stay in the car. I'll come and 
                         listen. (
                              (He leaves the 
                              darkness and walks 
                              to the car.)
                         What you want to tell me, Thorpey?

               Thorpe holds out his hand.

                                     THORPE
                         I've been asked to give you this.

               He hands Carter a railway ticket. Carter smiles.

                                     THORPE
                         Train goes at four minutes past 
                         twelve. You've just got time.

                                     CARTER
                         That's very kind of somebody. Who 
                         do I have to thank? (pause) What 
                         happens if I miss the train?

                                     THORPE
                         I've been asked to make sure you 
                         don't.

                                     CARTER
                         Oh, really. You're getting very 
                         optimistic in your old age, aren't 
                         you, Thorpey?

               One of the men inside mutters.

                                     MAN
                         Let's stop pissing about.

                                     THORPE
                         Are you coming, Jack? It'd be best.

               Carter tears the ticket in half and drops it in the gutter.

                                     THORPE
                         Right lads.

               The front passenger door starts to open. Carter grabs it 
               and pulls it wide open. With all his force, he slams it 
               against the man as he gets out. The window shatters over 
               his head. Blood spurts everywhere.  The driver panics. He 
               accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out. 
               His foot is trapped in a safety belt. He's upended and 
               dragged along the tarmac, his head dangerously close to 
               the back wheel. His yells make the driver brake. In the 
               confusion Thorpe escapes from the car and makes off. Carter 
               spots him and begins to run.

                                     CARTER
                              (roars)
                         Thorpe!

               Thorpe turns into the main road. He makes for the dance 
               hall and disappears inside. Carter follows.

               INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

               The dance floor is full, mainly with miniskirted girls, 
               their handbags at their feet. A rock band play mechanical 
               music to match the dancing.

               Thorpe vanishes into the crowd circling the floor. Carter 
               arrives. He scans the place, then sees Thorpe as he 
               disappears down into the gents' lavatory.

               INT. DANCE HALL - GENTS' LAVATORY - NIGHT

               Carter enters. There's no sign of Thorpe. He checks the 
               cubicles until he finds the one that's occupied, then goes 
               into the next one. He climbs on the seat and looks over 
               the partition. Thorpe is sitting down looking at the door. 
               Carter quietly leans across and pulls the chain. Thorpe 
               jumps up, terrified.

                                     CARTER
                         Time's up, Thorpey.

               Carter smiles.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               Keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits. 
               Edna's next-door neighbour, an OLD WOMAN, watches. Carter 
               and Thorpe come down the street.

                                     CARTER
                         Hello, Keith,
                              (pause)
                         Stay there, Thorpey.

               He knocks on Edna's door. It flies open. Edna is furious. 

                                     EDNA
                         What the bloody hell do you think 
                         you're at? 

                                     CARTER
                              (smiles)
                         I'm sorry.

                                     EDNA
                         You don't look it.

                                     CARTER
                         No. Really, I am.

                                     EDNA
                         Don't come that bloody flannel 
                         with me. If you're a traveller, 
                         I'm bloody Twiggy.
                              (She points at 
                              Thorpe.)
                         And who's he?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         What's going on? Have you no thought 
                         for others?

                                     CARTER
                         We're going inside.

                                     EDNA
                         Inside? Why should I give house-
                         room to your sort? 

                                     CARTER
                         Up the stairs, Keith. The door on 
                         the right.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot.  
                         Everybody knew there'd be trouble 
                         when you moved in.

               Carter, Keith and Thorpe enter the house.

                                     EDNA
                         You keep your trap shut, Ma.

                         I'll send my old man to see you!

                                     EDNA
                         And wouldn't he love it!

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

               Carter, Thorpe and Keith are climbing the stairs. Carter 
               stops to pick up Frank's casket. Edna rushes in and slams 
               the door.

                                     EDNA
                         Where do you think you're going? 

               Carter opens the door to his room.

                                     CARTER
                         Why don't you go and make us all a 
                         nice cup of tea? 

               Carter shoves Thorpe into the room.  Keith follows.

                                     EDNA
                         And what you going to do? 

                                     CARTER
                         Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll 
                         tell you. I might even let you 
                         watch.

                                     EDNA
                         I'll call the police.

                                     CARTER
                              (He knows she fancies 
                              him)
                         No, you won't.

               Carter closes the door.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Carter carefully places the casket on the chest of drawers. 

                                     CARTER
                         Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've 
                         got a secret benefactor.
                              (He moves into the 
                              room and opens his 
                              briefcase, which 
                              is lying on the 
                              bed.)
                         It's nice to know that. Isn't it, 
                         Keith?
                              (He takes out a 
                              bottle of whisky.)
                         There's only one trouble, I don't 
                         know who to thank.

               Thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch. Suddenly 
               Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and 
               collapses into a chair.

                                     CARTER
                         Now, I want to know who it is, 
                         Thorpey.

               Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues 
               wearily.

                                     CARTER
                         All right. If you like, Thorpey, 
                         we'll stop mucking about.  Somebody 
                         doesn't want me poking my nose 
                         into something and I happen to 
                         know what that something is.
                              (pause)
                         Now stand up.

               Thorpe looks at him, terrified. Slowly he stands. Carter 
               grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure. Thorpe 
               screams.

                                     CARTER
                         Who paid you to see me off?  

                                     THORPE
                         I can't Jack. How can I? 

                                     CARTER
                         Yes you can.

               Carter applies more pressure. Thorpe screams.

                                     THORPE
                         No, don't Jack, don't.

                                     CARTER
                         Who sent you, Thorpey? 

                                     THORPE
                              (desperate)
                         Brumby!

               Carter gives him a final squeeze and lets go. Thorpe groans 
               and slips to the floor, doubled up in agony.

                                     CARTER
                         There you are, you see. Now you 
                         could, couldn't you?
                         (pause)
                         And quickly.

               There's a knock on the door. Carter lets in Edna, who is 
               carrying the teatray.

                                     CARTER
                         Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea 
                         set.

                                     KEITH
                         Who's Brumby? 

                                     CARTER
                         Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea? 

               Keith nods.

                                     CARTER
                         Ever been into an arcade there and 
                         put a penny in the slot machine?  

                                     KEITH
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff 
                         Brumby, and like as not the bloody 
                         arcade as well. Right along the 
                         coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?

               Thorpe drags himself painfully to a chair.

                                     CARTER
                         Where's he living these days?  

                                     THORPE
                         He's got a new place at Burnham.

                                     CARTER
                         Address? 

                                     THORPE
                         On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.

                                     EDNA
                              (furious)
                         Suppose you tell me what the bloody 
                         hell's going on. It's my house, 
                         you know.

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, Edna, and I must say you've 
                         been great about the ...

                                     EDNA
                         Stick the soft soap. Let's be having 
                         it.

               Thorpe's plaintive voice interrupts.

                                     THORPE
                         Can I go now? 

                                     CARTER
                         You must be joking,
                              (to Keith)
                         Keep him away from the telephone. 
                         I'm going out for a bit.

                                     EDNA
                         Now just a minute...

                                     CARTER
                         Ta-ra.

                                     THORPE
                         Don't let on I told you, for God's 
                         sake.

               Carter laughs and closes the door.

               EXT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT

               It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the 
               road. The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, 
               with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well, 
               porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang 
               over everything.

               There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and 
               the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports 
               cars.

               Carter parks and gets out.

               Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily 
               pond.  There, he promptly throws up.

               Carter watches from behind a tree.

               His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the 
               drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out.

               CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably 
               dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Jesus wept!  

               MRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         Now, Cliff, don't get mad. 

                                     BRUMBY
                         I'll murder the little bitch!

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         Cliff ...

               Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A 
               young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a 
               latecomer, is stunned to see who it is.

                                     SANDRA
                         Daddy!

                                     BRUMBY
                         That's right, bloody Daddy.

                                     SANDRA
                         I wasn't expecting you until three 
                         o'clock.

                                     BRUMBY
                         And this is what you call having a 
                         few friends back for coffee, is 
                         it?

               Brumby pushes past her into the house.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Running bloody riot over my bloody 
                         furniture, drinking my bloody 
                         booze...

               The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers 
               out through the side door

                                     BRUMBY
                         ... spewing over my fucking 
                         goldfish.

               He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him 
               face-down into the lily pond.

               Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As 
               she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears 
               at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         Cliff ...

               Brumby throws the boy out.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Shut up, Phyllis.
                              (He walks back into 
                              the house.)
                         Sandra!

               Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby 
               passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a 
               bedroom.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch.

               Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the 
               row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in.

               INT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT

               Carter passes silently through the hall into the large 
               sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair. 

               Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs. 

                                     CARTER
                         Good evening.

               Mrs Brumby jumps.  The front door is open.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                              (standing)
                         Who are you?

                                     CARTER
                         I'm an old friend of Cliff's. I 
                         want to see him. 

               Mrs Brumby looks at her watch irritably.

                                     CARTER
                         It's urgent.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         What's it about? 

                                     CARTER
                         Business.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         I know all about Cliff's business.

               Carter moves further into the room.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah, well, tell him the Fletchers 
                         sent me.

               Mrs Brumby is uncertain what to do. Carter sits in an 
               armchair to make his point. She leaves. A moment later 
               Brumby storms into the room.

                                     BRUMBY
                         What the bloody hell's all this? 

               Carter doesn't move.

                                     BRUMBY
                         You know what the bloody time is!
                              (pause)
                         It's two o'clock in the bloody 
                         morning!

                                     CARTER
                         I know.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Well? 

               Carter still doesn 't move.

                                     BRUMBY
                         The wife says the Fletchers sent 
                         you.

               Carter just looks at him. Weighing him up.

                                     BRUMBY
                         What's so bloody important it 
                         couldn't wait till the morning?  

               Carter starts to laugh. He realizes Thorpe has lied to 
               him.  Brumby isn't his man.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Listen, I'm not in the mood for 
                         bloody silly buggers. 

               Carter stands.

                                     CARTER
                         I made a mistake.

                                     BRUMBY
                         What?

                                     CARTER
                         I made a mistake.

                                     BRUMBY
                         What about?

                                     CARTER
                         Never mind.

               Brumby looks confused.

                                     BRUMBY
                         It's not business?

               Carter moves to the door.

                                     CARTER
                         See you.

               Brumby moves between him and the door.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Listen, I don't like it when some 
                         hard nut comes pushing his way in 
                         and out my house in the middle of 
                         the night.

               Carter again makes to leave. Brumby stops him.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Bloody well tell me who sent you.

                                     CARTER
                         You're a big man, but you're in 
                         bad shape. With me, it's a full-
                         time job. Now behave yourself.

               Brumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch, 
               then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck.  
               Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt.

               Carter walks into the hall and out of the front door.

                                     CARTER
                         Good night, Mrs Brumby.

               EXT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He 
               finds the front door unlocked.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

               Carter enters cautiously. There is no sound. He closes the 
               door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs. Still 
               there is no sound. He waits. A sudden rustle attracts his 
               attention. Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Carter switches on the light. Edna is pressed against the 
               far wall, holding a poker. Her dress is torn and her hair 
               dishevelled. When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief.  

                                     EDNA
                         You sod.

                                     CARTER
                         They came back?

                                     EDNA
                              (sarcastically)
                         No.

               Carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap. 
               Edna looks at her torn dress.

                                     EDNA
                         Look at this. You bastard.

               Carter puts the glass on the table.

                                     EDNA
                         You don't care a stuff, do you?

               Carter takes out his phial of pills.

                                     CARTER
                         I'll buy you another.

               Carter swallows a pill.

                                     EDNA
                         What about the lad? They took him 
                         away.

               Carter shrugs his shoulders.

                                     EDNA
                         What'll they do to him?

                                     CARTER
                         Don't ask me.

               Edna rubs her wrists.

                                     EDNA
                         They bloody hurt me.

                                     CARTER
                         You're lucky. They kill as well. 

                                     EDNA
                              (mocking him)
                         And what about you? Did you kill 
                         Brumby?

               Carter shakes his head.

                                     EDNA
                         Thorpey nearly died laughing.

                                     CARTER
                         That little shit! 

                                     EDNA
                         What about Keith? 

                                     CARTER
                         What about Keith? 

                                     EDNA
                         What you going to do? 

                                     CARTER
                         Pension him off.

                                     EDNA
                         You're a bastard.

                                     CARTER
                              (angry)
                         What am I supposed to do?  I don't 
                         know where they've taken him. Do 
                         you?

               Edna shakes her head.

                                     CARTER
                         So shut up.

                                     EDNA
                         What's that gun doing in your room? 
                         Suppose I phoned the police and 
                         told them there's a bloke staying 
                         in my hotel who's planning to shoot 
                         somebody?

                                     CARTER
                         You wouldn't.

                                     EDNA
                         How'd you know I wouldn't? 

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         'Cos I know you wear purple 
                         underwear. 

                                     EDNA
                         What's that supposed to mean? 

                                     CARTER
                         Think about it.

               Carter takes hold of her torn blouse and rips it open. She 
               is wearing purple underwear.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               It's Sunday morning. A girls' marching band rehearses on 
               the wasteground in front of the terraced houses. The Pelaw 
               Hussars march back and forth carrying their proud banner, 
               led by the drum majorette.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Above the bed hangs a sign 'What would Jesus say?' In the 
               bed lie Carter and Edna. The distant sound of the marching 
               band helps them surface.

                                     EDNA
                         Are you awake? 

                                     CARTER
                         No.

                                     EDNA
                         Do you want breakfast? 

                                     CARTER
                         You must be joking. I never eat 
                         breakfast,
                              (pause)
                         Did you sleep well?  

                                     EDNA
                         Uh-huh.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               The Pelaw Hussars keep on marching. The back of their banner 
               a stirring motto For Youth and Valour.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Scene as before.

                                     EDNA
                         Did you sleep well?

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, thank you.

               He puts his arm around her and moves on top.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               As the band executes another movement, a red Jaguar slides 
               to a halt outside Edna's house. Two men get out. PETER the 
               Dutchman and CON MCCARTY are definitely not local lads. 
               They look, and are, lethal. They try Edna's front door. It 
               opens.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Scene as before.

                                     CARTER
                         Are you tired?  

                                     EDNA
                         No. Are you tired?  

                                     CARTER
                         No. I'm not tired,
                              (pause)
                         Do you eat breakfast? 

               Edna laughs. They start to make love. Gently. Below the 
               undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside 
               it, Carter's shotgun. Beyond is the bedroom door. It opens 
               slowly and the two men enter. Only their legs are visible.  

                                     CON (O.S.)
                         Put us in it, Jack.

               Carter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash. Edna screams 
               and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to 
               the floor. Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling. 
               Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide-
               bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. His hair is 
               bleached blond. Con is more traditional, more butch. He's 
               in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. Both are in their 
               thirties.

                                     PETER
                         Don't let us interrupt you, Jack.

                                     CARTER
                         I might have guessed.

                                     CON
                         Sorry about this. But there you 
                         are. Orders are orders.  

                                     CARTER
                         And what orders would they be, 
                         Con?  

               Carter's hand runs over the carpet. It's going towards the 
               chamber pot instead of the gun.

                                     CON
                         Gerald phoned us in the middle of 
                         the night, said he'd heard you've 
                         been making a nuisance of yourself.

                                     PETER
                         We've got to take you back to 
                         London.

                                     CON
                         He said it'd be doing him a big 
                         favour.

               Carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on 
               towards the gun.

                                     CON
                         We know why you're all steamed up, 
                         and so do Gerald and Sid.

                                     PETER
                         But they have to be diplomatic.

               Carter pulls out the gun and jumps up.

                                     CARTER
                         Right. Now take me back to London.

                                     CON
                              (smiling)
                         It'd be best if you got dressed 
                         first.

               Carter moves around the bed towards them. He's naked.

                                     CON
                         Put it away, Jack. You know you 
                         won't use it.

                                     PETER
                         The gun he means.

               Both men are laughing.

                                     CARTER
                         Out.

               Peter and Con back down the stairs. Peter looks up at 
               Carter's cock.

                                     PETER
                         If Anna could see you now.

                                     CARTER
                         Out.

                                     CON
                         Now, Jack. Be reasonable. You know 
                         we're going to take you back - 
                         sooner or later.

                                     CARTER
                         Out.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Con is the first to emerge from the front door.

                                     CON
                         Mind you don't catch cold.

               Peter follows.

                                     PETER
                         I hope she's got understanding 
                         neighbours.

               Then Carter comes out, shotgun held across his chest.

                                     CON
                         See you when you've got your drawers 
                         on.

               The old woman next door chooses that moment to come out 
               for her milk. As she straightens up, she sees Carter. The 
               bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep. 
               Carter, never taking his eyes off Peter and Con, slowly 
               backs into the house.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

               Carter watches from the window as he pulls on his jacket. 
               The gun lies across the armchair. Outside, he can see Peter 
               and Con talking by the Jaguar. Con exits.

               Edna, now in her dressing gown, enters.

                                     CARTER
                         Do us a favour?

                                     EDNA
                         What, and get myself beaten up 
                         again?

                                     CARTER
                         No chance of that.

                                     EDNA
                         Not much.

                                     CARTER
                         They're friends of mine.

                                     EDNA
                         And that'll make me feel better?  

                                     CARTER
                         I don't want to get rough, do I?  

               Carter picks up the gun. He hands Edna, bis case and the 
               casket.

               INT. REAR OF BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Edna comes out of the back gate into an alley, carrying 
               the casket and case. Con emerges from his hiding place 
               holding a handgun.

                                     CON
                         Hold it! Where do you think you're 
                         going?  

               Carter appears from the gate next door, covering Con with 
               the shotgun.

                                     CARTER
                         Strawberry Fair.

               He takes Con's handgun and signals him to go into Edna's 
               yard.

                                     CARTER
                         In.  Turn right. 
                              (He points the gun 
                              at the coalshed.)
                         Open that door.

               Con unbolts the door.

                                     CARTER
                         And go inside.

               Con goes in. Carter closes and bolts the door. He moves 
               quickly back to Edna and the car.

                                     EDNA
                         What you going to do?

                                     CARTER
                         I'm going to sit in the car and 
                         whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.

               Carter jumps into the car.

                                     EDNA
                         You coming back?

                                     CARTER
                         How could I stay away?

               The car roars off.

               EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY

               Washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see. 
               Carter drives full tilt through it, collecting towels and 
               sheets on the windscreen.

               EXT. EDNA'S YARD - DAY

               The coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering. It 
               finally gives and Con bursts out. He runs into the alley, 
               following after Carter.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE FRONT - DAY

               Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to 
               the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the 
               Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he 
               scarpers for the pavement.  Carter hits the Jaguar's door 
               at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to 
               the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he 
               is out of sight.

               Con comes running. Peter is looking at the damage.

                                     PETER
                         Where were you, then?  

               Con sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased.

                                     CON
                         Bollocks.

               EXT. BACK STREET - DAY

               Carter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the 
               washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected 
               garden.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

               Carter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man, 
               SHAMIR.

                                     CARTER
                         Keith in?  

                                     SHAMIR
                              (shouts)
                         Keith.

               No answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall.

                                     CARTER (O.S.)
                         Which is his room?

               INT. KEITH'S ROOM - DAY

               Carter enters and closes the door. Keith is in a had way, 
               his face like a piece of raw steak. He is lying on a bed, 
               still in the clothes of the night before.

                                     CARTER
                         What happened to you, then?

                                     KEITH
                         How'd you find me?

               Keith lifts his head painfully from the pillow.

                                     CARTER
                         Did they give you a rough time?

                                     KEITH
                         No.
                              (He lowers his head 
                              to the pillow.)
                         You bastard. You knew they'd come 
                         back.

                                     CARTER
                         No, I didn't,
                              (pause)
                         Does Albert Swift still live over 
                         the ferry?

                                     KEITH
                         Get knotted.

                                     CARTER
                         All right. All right. I want to 
                         square things with you first.

                                     KEITH
                         Oh yes? How?  

               Carter takes out of his wad of money. Keith's bloodshot 
               eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh.

                                     KEITH
                         Stuff it! My girl friend's coming 
                         from Liverpool tonight.  Nice 
                         surprise, isn't it?  

                                     CARTER
                         I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a 
                         course in karate.  

               He throws some money on the bed. Keith tries to kick it 
               off, but it's too painful. He clutches his testicles.

                                     KEITH
                         Frank said you were a shit and he 
                         was bloody well right.

               Carter turns to leave.  Keith continues, crying and angry.

                                     KEITH
                         You even screwed his wife, didn't 
                         you?  

               Carter shuts the door, leaving Keith shouting after him.

                                     KEITH
                         The poor bastard didn't even know 
                         if the kid was his.

               He falls back on to the bed, crying out in pain.

               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

               A wide road runs alongside the Tyne. It passes below the 
               vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city. A 
               carpark lies at the foot of the 'Iron Bridge'. Carter pulls 
               up and parks. He gets out and moves quickly.

               EXT. THE IRON BRIDGE - DAY

               The bridge is a, massive structure. The traffic lanes are 
               flanked each side by pedestrian walkways. It is here that 
               Carter and Margaret have arranged to meet.

                                     CARTER
                         How were things between you and 
                         Frank?

                                     MARGARET
                         He was all right to me.

                                     CARTER
                         Nothing more? Just another feller?

                                     MARGARET
                         Nicer than most.

                                     CARTER
                         But he was just another feller, 
                         wasn't he?

                                     MARGARET
                         Yes.

                                     CARTER
                         Though nicer than most?  

                                     MARGARET
                         Yes. I can't help the way I am.

                                     CARTER
                              (ignoring the 
                              statement)
                         Why'd you see him so regular?

                                     MARGARET
                         Once a week?  

                                     CARTER
                         I call that regular.

                                     MARGARET
                         He was gentlemanly. I like that.

                                     CARTER
                         Once a week you like a gentleman?  

                                     MARGARET
                              (angrily)
                         Look, I'm me, right. You're not. 
                         We are what we are, like it or 
                         not.
                              (She turns and walks 
                              slowly along the 
                              bridge.)
                         Why all the bloody needle?  

                                     CARTER
                         What was bugging Frank?  

                                     MARGARET
                         He wanted me to leave Dave and 
                         marry him. Last Friday I told him 
                         it wouldn't work. Dave would have 
                         killed us both!
                              (pause)
                         He followed me home and kicked up 
                         a stink in the street,
                              (pause)
                         I had to tell Frank I couldn't see 
                         him any more. It was getting too 
                         dodgy. That was on Sunday.
                              (She stops and looks 
                              over the bridge.)
                         He said he'd kill himself. I was 
                         frightened what you might do.

               They look at each other for a moment. Carter shakes his 
               head. He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face 
               and folds them up.

                                     CARTER
                         I don't believe you, Margaret. 
                         Frank wasn't like that.
                              (pause)
                         I'm the villain in the family, 
                         remember?

                                     MARGARET
                         It's the truth.

               Carter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away. 

                                     MARGARET
                         It is. Honestly.

                                     CARTER
                              (shouting)
                         You bloody whore. Frank was too 
                         careful to die like that. Who killed 
                         him?

                                     MARGARET
                         I don't know nothing.

               Carter holds her arm. She winces like she's been hit before. 

                                     CARTER
                         Listen, the only reason I came 
                         back to this craphole was to find 
                         out who did it. And I won't leave 
                         until I do. You understand?

               Behind Carter Peter's Jaguar comes slowly along the bridge.  
               It stops. The passenger side is a gaping hole.

                                     CON
                         Hello, Jack.

               Carter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back 
               to Margaret.

                                     CARTER
                         You bitch! It was you who told 
                         them I was here, wasn't it?

               He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out. 
               The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the 
               pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get 
               to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans 
               out, his usual cheery self.

                                     CON
                         Peter's very upset about his car. 
                         He's going to shit all over you.

                                     CARTER
                         I'll catch up with you later, 
                         Margaret.

               And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated 
               roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar.

                                     PETER
                              (shouts above the 
                              revs)
                         Come on, get in.

               Con does and they race off.

               EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

               Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown 
               steps leading down to the river road, where his car is 
               parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to 
               a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives 
               chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off.

               EXT. RIVER ROAD - DAY

               Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind.  
               He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see 
               his parked car.   

               As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the 
               hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car.

               A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars 
               into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him 
               just before the Jaguar and slows down.

                                     GLENDA
                         Over here, Jack.

               Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, 
               so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off.

               The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming 
               Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing 
               the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre.

               Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at 
               the top of the hill.

               INT. SUNBEAM - DAY

               Every movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual 
               gear changes, steering, even braking. Carter can't take 
               his eyes off her.

                                     GLENDA
                         You didn't know you had a fairy 
                         godmother, did you? 

                                     CARTER
                         No. I didn't know that.

                                     GLENDA
                         A fairy godmother, all of your 
                         own. Aren't you lucky? 

                                     CARTER
                         So where are we going, Princess?  

                                     GLENDA
                         To the demon king's castle, of 
                         course.

                                     CARTER
                         Of course. Where else?  

               The car screams off the road into a multi-storey carpark.

               INT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY

               Glenda really puts her foot down. The car hurtles around 
               each deserted floor.

                                     CARTER
                         How'd you know where I'd be?  

                                     GLENDA
                         You were seen parking your car. 
                         The demon king waves his wand and 
                         I was dispatched to bring you to 
                         him. Lucky for you I waited.

                                     CARTER
                         Very lucky, I should think. You're 
                         drunk!  

                                     GLENDA
                         Nasty.

                                     CARTER
                         He must have been pretty sure I'd 
                         come.

                                     GLENDA
                         Oh, he was. He told me a magic 
                         spell that would make you come.

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         And what was that?  

                                     GLENDA
                         We're there now.

               She brakes to a split-second stop.

               INT. PENTHOUSE RESTAURANT - DAY

               It's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows 
               all the way round. Wires are hanging from the ceiling and 
               walls where the lights will eventually be fixed.

               A tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting 
               sun. He is just a silhouette.

               Carter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man. The 
               silhouette turns as he nears it. It's Brumby.

                                     BRUMBY
                         A new venture of mine. It's going 
                         to be a restaurant.
                              (pause)
                         Do you like it?  

                                     CARTER
                         Yes.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Last night, after you'd gone, I 
                         did a little bit of asking around. 
                         Seeing as you weren't very 
                         forthcoming,
                              (pause)
                         It seems that you are concerned 
                         about the death of your brother?  
                         (pause) I got to thinking it would 
                         be nice if the bloke you were after 
                         was the same bloke I wanted off my 
                         back,
                              (pause)
                         You know my life. Machines. The 
                         arcades. Nice business. Looks after 
                         itself. People put money in. I 
                         take it out. Not much rough stuff. 
                         It's a business that makes me very 
                         happy. But recently, I've had a 
                         spot of bother,
                              (pause)
                         One of my lads gets a bit over-
                         anxious and flogs some machines in 
                         a club that's already got some. 
                         The upshot is I've had to eat shit 
                         and stop flogging my machines to 
                         other clubs.
                              (pause)
                         So far as I'm concerned, that's 
                         it. Apparently not. These people 
                         I've offended get the idea that it 
                         would be good to take over my whole 
                         outfit,
                              (pause)
                         So I'm worried. I can't fight them 
                          I haven't that kind of set-up. 
                         But I've got to fix them before 
                         they fix me. Trouble is, if I try 
                         and they find out, I'm dead.

               Brumby picks up a black briefcase. He holds it up to Carter. 

                                     BRUMBY
                         Five grand. It belongs to you. 
                         Along with a little name I'm going 
                         to give you.

                                     CARTER
                         What name?  

                                     BRUMBY
                         Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.
                              (pause)
                         Kinnear did it.  

                                     CARTER
                         Why?  

                                     BRUMBY
                         I don't know. All I know is that 
                         people were shitting bricks up at 
                         his place last Saturday. Your 
                         brother's name was mentioned. Next 
                         day, he was dead.

                                     CARTER
                         Why?  

                                     BRUMBY
                         I don't know. That's all I was 
                         told.

               Carter takes a last look at Glenda and walks slowly back 
               towards the entrance.

                                     CARTER
                         That's not good enough.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Christ, what...

                                     CARTER
                              (shouting)
                         Do me a favour. You don't really 
                         expect me to fix Kinnear on your 
                         say-so?
                              (pause)
                         Just because they tried to get me 
                         on you last night, don't think you 
                         can pull the same trick. Stroll 
                         on.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Jack, you're wrong.

                                     CARTER
                         Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter 
                         exits.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Jack...

               EXT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY

               Carter steps out of the elevator as Glenda's Sunbeam comes 
               down the bottom ramp fast. The car brakes hard and stops. 
               Carter opens the door and gets in. Not a word is said.

               INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The apartment is one of many in a modern block and Glenda 
               has only recently moved in. There is a mattress on the 
               floor. A large mirror leans against the wall behind it and 
               a film projector stands close to the window, which has 
               makeshift curtains.

               Carter and Glenda are on the mattress. The bedding is all 
               over the place. They have just finished fucking.

                                     CARTER
                              (looking around)
                         Who's setting you up in this place?

                                     GLENDA
                         Brumby.

                                     CARTER
                         Is he coming here?

                                     GLENDA
                         Don't worry. He's meeting the 
                         architects at the restaurant.

               Carter plays with her hair.

                                     CARTER
                         Aren't you scared Kinnear will 
                         find out?

                                     GLENDA
                         He won't. He thinks I'm simple.

               Carter kisses her neck.

                                     CARTER
                         What does he want that bloody great 
                         country place for?

                                     GLENDA
                              (knowingly)
                         Entertaining.

                                     CARTER
                         What kind of entertaining?  

                                     GLENDA
                         Now you're asking.

               Carter looks at the film projector by the bed and points. 

                                     CARTER
                         Does Brumby get a kick out of that 
                         crap?

                                     GLENDA
                              (giggling)
                         Especially when I play the lead.

               Carter wraps his arms about her.

                                     CARTER
                         Did Kinnear say anything? After 
                         I'd left the other night?

               Glenda sits up sharply.

                                     GLENDA
                         That's why you waited for me.

                                     CARTER
                              (kissing her on the 
                              neck)
                         Not entirely. No.

                                     GLENDA
                         You sure about that?  

                                     CARTER
                         Sure I'm sure.

               Glenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed.

                                     GLENDA
                         You bastard.

               Glenda leaves for the bathroom. Carter, curious, looks at 
               the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam 
               of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch 
               the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked 
               on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'.  A zoom back 
               reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is 
               followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school 
               uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops. 
               A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is 
               Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed.

               INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Glenda is in the bath. Lots of foam. The hot water is still 
               running.  She's smoking. She leans forward, turning off 
               the tap.

               INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft 
               porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him.

               The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. 
               The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes 
               in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity. 
               Glenda is there to greet them.

               The girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax, 
               sitting her down and showing her a magazine.

               Glenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top 
               off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her 
               hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen.

               Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in 
               the film.  Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock 
               at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, 
               eventually rolling off the bed.

               The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar 
               comes in.

               Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift.

               Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves.  
               Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the 
               two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his 
               prize Doreen.  Carter watches.

               Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. Reflected in 
               the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off 
               his trousers. The reel runs out and flaps like a fish. 
               Carter doesn't move. Tears form in his eyes. He looks old 
               and defeated. His is a wasted life. Then the anger that 
               drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.

               INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Carter, now dressed, moves slowly towards her in the bath.  

                                     CARTER
                         I want to give you an Oscar.

                                     GLENDA
                              (laughs)
                         You've been watching the film.

                                     CARTER
                         Tell me about the girl.

                                     GLENDA
                         What girl?

                                     CARTER
                         The young girl. Who pulled her?

                                     GLENDA
                         I don't know.

                                     CARTER
                         Was it Albert?

                                     GLENDA
                         Shouldn't think so.

                                     CARTER
                         Is it one of Kinnear's films?

                                     GLENDA
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         Who set it up?  Eric?

                                     GLENDA
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         Then he must have pulled her.

                                     GLENDA
                         Expect so.

                                     CARTER
                         Did my brother Frank find out?

                                     GLENDA
                         Your brother? What you talking 
                         about?

               Carter's fury bursts. He's out of control. He seizes Glenda 
               and plunges her under the bathwater, holding her there. 

                                     CARTER
                         You're a lying bitch.

               Carter lifts her up, out of the water. She is spluttering, 
               nearly drowned.

                                     CARTER
                         Now tell me the truth.

                                     GLENDA
                         The girl's name was Doreen. That's 
                         all I know.

                                     CARTER
                         And you didn't know her last name?

                                     GLENDA
                         No.

                                     CARTER
                         Well, it's Carter. That's my name,
                              (pause)
                         And her father was my brother. And 
                         he was murdered last Sunday. Now 
                         get up and get dressed.

               He pushes her ahead of him.

               EXT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

               Carter manhandles Glenda towards her Sunbeam. He opens the 
               boot.

                                     CARTER
                         Get in.

               Glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut. The car 
               scorches away.

               EXT. JETTY. TYNE FERRY - DAY

               Carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks. He moves 
               down the gangway towards it.

               INT. CAFE - DAY

               A girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea. The 
               door slams open. There's Carter.

                                     CARTER
                         Where's Albert?

               The girl is numb with fear, unable to answer. Carter grabs 
               her by the throat.

                                     CARTER
                         Where's Albert?

               The girl is frozen with terror. He lets go as suddenly as 
               he grabbed her.

                                     CARTER
                         I know where I'll find him.

               EXT. BACK STREET - DAY

               Carter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being 
               dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe.

                                     GIRL (V.O.)
                         Eric, he's come for Albert,
                              (pause)
                         I don't know, (pause) On the ferry, 
                         I reckon.

               Carter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in.

               INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY

               Carter closes the door. Race results and odds are coming 
               over the Tannoy. He moves into the shop until he reaches 
               ALBERT SWIFT. Albert is making out a betting slip and 
               doesn't see him.

                                     CARTER
                         Hello, Albert.

               Albert looks like he's going to be sick.

                                     ALBERT
                         Hello, Jack,
                              (snivelling)
                         I don't know anything, Jack.

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll 
                         kill you.

                                     ALBERT
                         I know. I know.

               Carter sees a door at the back. There's a sign for the 
               toilets.

                                     CARTER
                         Do you want to go to the toilet, 
                         Albert?

               At first Albert doesn't understand.

                                     CARTER
                         Do you want to go to the toilet, 
                         Albert?

               This time it clicks. Albert moves to the door and Carter 
               follows.

               EXT. BETTING SHOP BACKYARD - DAY

               Carter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He 
               reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and 
               he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him 
               down. Albert faces him.

                                     CARTER
                         You can't get away from me, Albert. 

                                     ALBERT
                         I know.

               He feels for his cigarettes but can't find them.

                                     ALBERT
                         For Christ's sake, give us a fag.

               Carter takes out his cigarettes. Albert takes one.

                                     ALBERT
                         I didn't know who Doreen was. 
                         Thought she was just another bird.

                                     CARTER
                         Did Eric Pake pull her?

                                     ALBERT
                         Yes.

                                     CARTER
                         How?

                                     ALBERT
                         I dunno. He's got his ways. He 
                         knows Margaret.

                                     CARTER
                         When did you find out?

                                     ALBERT
                         A couple of weeks back.

                                     CARTER
                         How?

                                     ALBERT
                         No choice. I had a visit from 
                         somebody.

                                     CARTER
                         Who?

                                     ALBERT
                         Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. 
                         He wanted to meet Doreen.

                                     CARTER
                         And you told Brumby?

               Albert nods.

                                     CARTER
                         Who killed Frank?

               Albert doesn 't answer.

                                     CARTER
                         Do you want to be dead, Albert?

                                     ALBERT
                         Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and 
                         two of his boys arrive with Frank 
                         and tell me that he's rumbled. 
                         Somehow, he's seen the film and 
                         was about to shoot his mouth off. 
                         They ask me for some whisky and 
                         start forcing it down his throat.
                              (pause)
                         I thought they'd just duff him up 
                         a bit. Honest.

                                     CARTER
                         What did you do?  Albert?

                                     ALBERT
                         Nothing. What could I do?

                                     CARTER
                         Did Eric know that Frank was my 
                         brother?

                                     ALBERT
                         Yes. I told him.

                                     CARTER
                         What did he say?

                                     ALBERT
                         'Good.'

               Albert draws deeply on his cigarette.

               They drove Frank away in a car.

                                     CARTER
                         Is that all there is?

               Albert nods.

                                     CARTER
                         Then that's it, Albert.

               Carter takes something from his pocket. There's a loud 
               click.  It's a. knife.

                                     ALBERT
                         Jack, for Christ's sake ...

               He falls to his knees.

                                     CARTER
                         You knew what I'd do.

                                     ALBERT
                              (crying)
                         Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't 
                         kill him.

               Carter drives the knife into him with all his might.

                                     CARTER
                         I know you didn't kill him.
                              (and again.)
                         I know you didn't.

               A ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour. Albert 
               leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward, 
               twitches, and is dead.

               INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY

               Carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to 
               the street. A blind man is at the counter placing a bet.

               EXT. JETTY - TYNE FERRY - DAY

               The Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter 
               arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down 
               the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging 
               across the water.

               INT. FERRY - DAY

               Carter sits, watching the other passengers. A mother and 
               two young children take his attention. His look is tinted 
               with regret even remorse.

               EXT. JETTY - DAY

               As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up 
               to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter 
               standing alone.  He's holding Con's handgun.

               Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters. 
               Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter 
               from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter 
               is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. Eric 
               shouts.

                                     ERIC
                         No shooters. Cyril said no shooters, 
                         you stupid bastard.

                                     PETER
                         Get stuffed.  He's reloading.

                                     CON
                         Gerald wants to see him first.

                                     PETER
                         Shut up.

               Carter is listening to all this.

                                     CARTER
                              (shouting)
                         Are you coming in? Or do we piss 
                         about all day?

               Eric laughs.

                                     ERIC
                         You're finished, Jack. You know 
                         that, don't you? I've bloody 
                         finished you.

                                     CARTER
                         Not till I'm dead, Eric.

               Eric laughs.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, you've still got your sense of 
                         humour?  Tell him how I've fixed 
                         him, Con.

                                     CON
                         He's told Gerald about you and 
                         Anna.

                                     ERIC
                         Didn't believe us at first, did 
                         he, Con? Then Peter talked to him.

                                     PETER
                         Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked 
                         us to take you back - alive.

                                     ERIC
                         He's probably talking to her right 
                         now. Are you still going to fancy 
                         her when Gerald's finished with 
                         her face?

               Carter shows no emotion. Or are his eyes just that bit 
               sadder?  Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered. 
               Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry.  

               Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the 
               ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves 
               himself into position, Carter is waiting.

                                     CARTER
                         Stay where you are, Peter.

               Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even 
               raise his shooter.

                                     PETER
                              (screaming)
                         Don't.

               There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he 
               cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he 
               hits the deck, he's dead.  

               Con and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out 
               of range.

                                     ERIC
                         Carter, your car needs a wash.

               Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the 
               Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done.  
               Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around 
               the sinking car.

               Carter watches impassively.

               EXT. BRUMBY'S RESTAURANT COMPLEX - DAY

               Carter's hire car corners at speed into the high-rise 
               carpark.

               INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               Brumby and two architects in a site meeting. Plans are 
               laid out on a table.

                                     BRUMBY
                         I don't want them cooking in here. 
                         You can put a hatch in that wall.

                                     INTERIOR DECORATOR
                         Yes, it's all a question of ...

               The sound of a car screeching up the ramps interrupts him. 

                                     BRUMBY
                         Who in Christ's name is that? It's 
                         a bloody madman.  

               He strides away to investigate.

               EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               Brumby comes out to the top tier. On the floor below, 
               Carter, unseen by Brumby, has parked and is now making for 
               the concrete spiral staircase.

               EXT. STAIRCASE - DAY

               Brumby pounds down to the first level. Carter comes around 
               the corner.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Jack!  

               Carter slams his fist hard into his gut.

                                     CARTER
                         You shouldn't have shown the film 
                         to Frank.

                                     BRUMBY
                         I had to. It was the only way I 
                         could get at them.

               INT. BACK STREET POST OFFICE -  EVENING.

               It's a combined shop and post office. Carter is on the 
               phone. 

                                     CARTER
                         The guy on the swing-bridge?
                              (pause)
                         OK.

               Carter hangs up. He takes a can of film from his pocket 
               and slips it into a large envelope.  At the counter two 
               women are talking.

                                     FIRST WOMAN
                         They don't know how it happened.

                                     SECOND WOMAN
                         How far did he fall?

                                     FIRST WOMAN
                         What did Betty say... Ninety floors, 
                         I think it was.

                                     SECOND WOMAN
                         Really. Was he dead?

                                     FIRST WOMAN
                         Oh, yes.

               The envelope is passed across to the post office assistant. 
               It is addressed to Vice Squad, Scotland Yard, London Sw1. 

                                     SECOND WOMAN
                         Better to go quick like that.

               EXT. SWING-BRIDGE - EVENING

               The huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man-made 
               island in the middle of the river.

               On top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from 
               which a man operates the bridge. Carter climbs the outside 
               ladder. A man waits for him at the top.

               The man hands him a small cloth package. Carter opens it. 
               Inside is heroin and a hypodermic. He wraps it up again 
               and hands over an envelope. The man checks the money as 
               Carter disappears down the outside ladder.

               INT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT

               The hall is crowded. The compere calls the numbers. The 
               atmosphere is tense as the audience look at their cards. 
               Someone calls, 'Bingo.' A buzz goes round the hall as 
               everybody starts talking again.

               Carter enters, surveying the audience. Eventually, his 
               eyes alight on the person he's been looking for Margaret. 
               She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him. 

               The next game starts up.

               EXT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT

               Crowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the 
               evening's entertainment. Margaret walks out with her friend. 
               Carter follows them and turns up a side street.

               EXT. STEPS LEADING TO BACK STREET - NIGHT

               The place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the 
               steps. The clop of their high heels is the only sound. 
               Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her 
               friend chat for a moment and part.

               Carter follows Margaret.

               EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

               The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She 
               appears. Carter is following behind. He slips into another 
               dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home 
               Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding 
               Con's handgun.

                                     CARTER
                         I've come for you, Margaret.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               There's a big party going on. The music is loud. It's mainly 
               rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds. 
               Different things are obviously going on in different rooms 
               in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another, 
               etc. Kinnear flits from one to another. Eric Paice is on 
               the phone. He puts the receiver down and crosses to Kinnear.

                                     ERIC
                         Gerald Fletcher wants a word with 
                         you Cyril.

               Kinnear crosses to the telephone.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Hello, Gerald.

               EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT

               Carter stands in the dimly lit kiosk with Margaret. The 
               hire car is parked alongside.

                                     CARTER
                         It's Carter. Listen carefully, you 
                         hairy-faced git. I've got the film 
                         and enough evidence to put you 
                         away for a long time. All it takes 
                         is one call to the police.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kinnear listens.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Really?
                              (pause)
                         So?

               EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT

               Carter into phone.

                                     CARTER
                         I'll do a simple deal with you. 
                         All I want is ...

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kinnear is still listening to Carter. He looks over at 
               Eric, who's fixing a drink.

                                     KINNEAR
                         I see. I think that can be arranged.

               Kinnear continues listening.

               INT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT

               Carter into phone.

                                     CARTER
                         ... but I don't want him there 
                         until six in the morning.  OK?
                              (pause)
                         Right.

               Carter hangs up. He pushes Margaret towards the car.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT

               The noise of the wild party is heard off. Eric comes into 
               the room.

                                     ERIC
                         You want something, Cyril?

                                     KINNEAR
                         Yes, Eric. A word with you.

               EXT. DESERTED WOOD - NIGHT

               Headlights, through the thick trees, as Carter's car comes 
               bouncing over rough ground.

               INT. HIRE CAR - NIGHT

               Carter stops in a clearing and leaves his headlights on. 
               He turns to Margaret.

                                     CARTER
                         Get out.

               Carter and Margaret get out. They appear in the beam of 
               the headlights and move further into the wood.

               EXT. WOOD - NIGHT

               Carter and Margaret stop.

                                     CARTER
                         Take your clothes off.

               Margaret is confused.  Take your clothes off.  Margaret 
               does just that: coat, blouse, skin. She goes to remove her 
               knickers.

                                     CARTER
                         Keep your pants on.
                              (pause)
                         Lie down.

               Again she obeys.

               He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then 
               stuffs a gag in her mouth.

               He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm, 
               and injects the heroin into her. She struggles, her eyes 
               moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by 
               the gag.  Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under.  
               Carter removes the gag. He stands, picks her up and walks 
               into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Kinnear is alone, speaking on the telephone quietly. The 
               party is still going on.

                                     KINNEAR
                         I want you to listen very carefully. 
                         Jack Carter,
                              (pause)
                         You know what he looks like?

               INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A bedside light is on. A man in bed is listening on the 
               phone.

                                     MAN
                         Yes.

               He taps his cigarette against the ashtray. On his middle 
               finger is a large ring with the initial 'J' on it. He 
               listens until the line goes dead.

               The woman beside him stirs. He stubs out the cigarette and 
               switches off the light. Darkness.

               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN

               Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still 
               in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN

               Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's 
               house.

               The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road.

               There's the sound of a phone being dialled.

                                     CARTER (V.O.)
                         Police.

               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN

               A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive, 
               followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and 
               around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around 
               the building. A chief constable opens the front door and 
               walks in.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN

               The police move through the house and grounds. In the 
               bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The 
               men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about 
               being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, 
               pornography and so on.

               Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass 
               leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They 
               follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, 
               face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes 
               in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we 
               see that it's Margaret.

               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN

               The house is surrounded by police measuring and 
               photographing, and outside the house are police cars and 
               ambulances.  The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In 
               the early-morning light, they look like dolls.

               Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes 
               officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes 
               down the short drive to the gate.

               INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN

               Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide 
               beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his 
               left.

               The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a 
               harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast 
               wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal 
               loader for tankers.

               This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and 
               pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top 
               tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal 
               chutes.

               EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN

               Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle 
               of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to 
               the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man 
               is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. 
               He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. 
               Carter follows.

               At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only 
               the harbour waters lapping below.

               Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see 
               Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the 
               roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly 
               above him.

               Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's 
               playing cat and mouse with Eric.

                                     CARTER
                              (calling out)
                         You couldn't win an egg and spoon 
                         race, Eric.

                                     ERIC
                              (wheezing)
                         Sod off.

               Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and 
               makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. 
               Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the 
               gun up. Eric stops and looks up.

                                     CARTER
                         Stay away from the car or I'll 
                         blow you apart.  

               Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. 
               He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards 
               the beach. Carter starts after him.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his 
               feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting.

               In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.  Carter 
               appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at 
               the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and 
               starts running.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and 
               panics. He stumbles and falls over.

               He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the 
               headland. Carter follows.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               On the other side of the headland, the scene is 
               extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the 
               world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's 
               littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep 
               in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the 
               left. It's deserted.

               In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets 
               move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit 
               their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal 
               mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The 
               sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore.  

               Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. 
               Carter closes on him.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the 
               mine.  Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and 
               crash as they move along the cable.

               Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal 
               slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on 
               his heels.  Near the top, where the buckets are practically 
               at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too 
               exhausted to get up.

               Carter stands over him.

                                     CARTER
                              (panting slightly)
                         Stand up, Eric. Stand up.

               Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch 
               out of his pocket.

                                     CARTER
                         I bet you could use a drink, could 
                         you, Eric?  

               He throws the bottle to Eric.

                                     CARTER
                         Eh? Have a drink.

                                     ERIC
                         Still got your sense of humour.

               Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a 
               terrible state.

                                     CARTER
                         Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want 
                         you to drink all of that. Do you 
                         understand? Drink up. Just like it 
                         was with my brother, Frank. Go on, 
                         son. Drink up.

               Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and 
               runs down his face.

                                     CARTER
                         Drink up, Eric.

               Eric begins to stagger about.

                                     CARTER
                         It was you who poured it down him. 
                         Eh, Eric?  

               Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No 
               mercy there.

                                     CARTER
                         Did you all have a good laugh, eh? 
                         Did you have a good laugh when he 
                         was spewing it up? The whisky is 
                         pouring all over Eric's face and 
                         suit.

               It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing 
               comes up.

                                     CARTER
                         Drink it! Drink it! Did you all 
                         pass the bottle round after the 
                         car went over the top?  

               Eric is choking.

                                     CARTER
                         Don't stop, Eric.

               Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle 
               up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the 
               shotgun.  Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough. 

                                     CARTER
                         Goodbye, Eric.

               Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on 
               Eric's head.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on 
               it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun 
               riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as 
               it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final 
               journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic 
               catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal 
               slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over 
               and everything is gone.

               Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the 
               beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get 
               rid of it.

               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING

               Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises 
               the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle 
               and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around 
               the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a 
               large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It 
               is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his 
               death. 

               The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a 
               quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING

               Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A 
               small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple. 
               He's dead.

               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING

               Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle. He carefully 
               wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier. He walks off and 
               is soon lost as he drops out of sight.

                                                               FADE OUT:

CARD OVER: SANDERSON PRISON

EXT. PRISON YARD - TITLES OVER - DAY

DOC McCOY IS BEING WALKED ACROSS THE COMPOUND BY A UNIFORMED
GUARD, carrying a riot gun. Other Prisoners around the yard
turn and stare as the two men head for the main building.

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR

DOC WALKS DOWN THE BLEAK HALLWAY: A BLACK PRISONER PASSES Doc
in the corridor, they slap hands... the Guard remains at his
shoulder. Near the end of the passage another Guard clangs
open a barred door and allows Doc and the First Guard to
enter the room where he stands sentry.

INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

A LONG TABLE HAS BEEN SET UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM, several
Prison Officials and Parol Board Members are seated facing
the length of the room.

Seated at one end of the table is an Irish looking Man;
floridly handsome and a bit overweight, his red hair is
beginning to grey. The Nameplate in front of him reads J.
BEYNON.

Doc enters the room and seats himself near two other
PRISONERS, the GUARD stands back against the wall.



                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Another table has been set up; this one near the seated
Prisoners, for their LEGAL COUNSELS -- SEVERAL LAWYERS
examine papers before them, waiting for the hearing to begin.

A MAN at the center of the large table clears his throat,
then begins to speak.

                    CHAIRMAN
          I think we can begin... First parole
          request Carter "Doc" McCoy... is legal
          counsel present?

A MAN rises from behind the lawyers' table.

                    LAWYER
          Yes. Eugene Stewart representing Mr.
          McCoy.

                    DOC
          watching... taking it all in.

AT THE TABLE

The Man checks the papers before him.

                    CHAIRMAN
              (his voice a bored drone)
          Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence
          for armed robbery, first offense in the
          State of Texas, wanted by the State of
          Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and
          armed robbery...

                    LAWYER
          The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction,
          Mr. Chairman. They no longer seek Mr.
          McCoy in connection with that case.

                    CHAIRMAN
              (adjusting his papers)
          That is correct. Very well. Mr. McCoy has
          served four years of his sentence. Prison
          record satisfactory. Applied for parole
          on September 5th of this year...

The Chairman lowers the paper, looks across to the lawyer.

                    CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Remarks?




                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.
CONTINUED:


                    LAWYER
          We would only again like to call the
          committee's attention to Mr. McCoy's
          satisfactory behavior as a prisoner.

                    CHAIRMAN
          Notice is taken.

He looks down the table at the dark-suited men.

                    CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          The Board met in closed chambers last
          week... have you reached a decision
          regarding Mr. McCoy's request for parole?

                    DOC
          His face is taut.

AT THE TABLE

A Second MAN looks across to the Chairman.

                    SECOND MAN
              (seated near Beynon)
          Request for parole is denied. The
          prisoner may re-apply in one calendar
          year.

                    DOC
          lowers his eyes, then looks up at his
          lawyer. The lawyer avoids Doc's glance.,
          he shuffles the papers in front of him,
          begins stuffing them into his briefcase.

AT THE TABLE THE CHAIRMAN FLIPS HIS PAPERS TO A NEW PAGE

                    CHAIRMAN
              (still totally without emotion)
          Very well. The next request for parole is
          from John Doty. Is legal counsel present?

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Yes.

                    CHAIRMAN
          Mr. Doty is serving five to twelve years
          for embezzlement of corporate funds.

He works carefully at a toothpick suspension bridge. Doc
glues the final pieces into place...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              5.
CONTINUED:


Around the cubicle his personal effects can be seen, a
picture of an attractive woman, several battered paperbacks.

Doc continues looking at the bridge... then suddenly begins
smashing it to pieces with his right fist.

INT. PRISON - VISITING BUNGALOW - DAY

DOC IS SEATED... WAITING. CAROL enters the darkened room and
seats herself opposite Doc. They are separated by a wide
table and net of wire meshing that springs upward from mid-
point between them.

                    CAROL
              (big smile, she wants the
               moment to be an upper)
          Hello, Doc.

He simply stares back at her. Carol's finely honed features
compliment a face that at first glance is pretty,at a second
glance shows willful strength. Doc continues looking at
Carol.

                       CAROL (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

Doc is silent.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          It's been raining a lot the last few
          days.

Doc is silent.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          We'll try again.

                    DOC
          No way. I've got to get out now.

Get to Beynon, tell him I'm for sale. His price.

She looks at him.

                       DOC (CONT'D)
          Do it now.

She hesitates, tries to touch him through the mesh. Gets up
and leaves. Doc remains unmoving.

EXT. COUNTRY COURTHOUSE - SAN MARCOS, TEXAS - DAY

                                                             6.



CAROL MOVES TO THE BACK OF THE LARGE BTJILDING AND UP A REAR
STAIRWAY TOWARD THE OVERHEAD OFFICE.

INT. COURTHOUSE

CAROL ENTERS A LEGAL OFFICE, WEARING A SOFT BILLOWY dress.
She looks very good.

A middle aged SECRETARY looks up at Carol. A short balding
man (THE ACCOUNTANT) in his forties works at a large desk
across the room from the Secretary. He seems totally occupied
with his bookwork.

NEAR THE ACCOUNTANT THREE MEN ARE SEATED ON A DAVENPORT

They are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be
anything at all but all three have commonality; they are
professionals.

HAYHOE - Thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter
ender.

CULLY - Well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop
out of his buttoned shirtsleeves...

SWAIN - a little older and a little smarter than the other
two, his narrow features allow no warmth.

                                              AFTER A MOMENT:

SECRETARY Yes?

                    CAROL
          I want to see Jack Beynon.

The Accountant nods to the Secretary, she points Carol
towards a door leading to an inner office.

                    SECRETARY
          Go right in, Mrs. McCoy.

DOC AND CAROL - PACES, PARTS OP BODIES, EMPHASIS ON HANDS, in
bed... his hand touching the soft white skin beneath her
stomach.

BACK WITHIN THE OFFICE THE THREE MEN LOOK AFTER CAROL

                    CULLY
          Class - regular?

                    SWAIN
          No. Doc McCoy's old lady.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              7.
CONTINUED:


Cully looks startled.

                    CULLY
          Jesus. Carol Ainsley?

                    SWAIN
          The very same.

                    CULLY
          The Doctor took out McGovern for her.

                    SWAIN
          She only rides winning - Class easy
          class.

                       ACCOUNTANT
          Shut up.

INT. BEYNON'S OFFICE

CAROL ENTERS.

A WOMAN'S LIPS - FLASH CUT

pressed against a man's neck. She kisses, then bites a tiny
portion of skin.

BACK TO BEYNON'S OFFICE. HE IS POURING A DRINK.

                    BEYNON
          How are you, Mrs. McCoy?

CAROL APPROACHES BEYNON'S DESK WITH A NERVOUSLY

DETERMINED STRIDE

                    CAROL
          Ready to talk about my husband, Mr.
          Beynon.

                     BEYNON
          So the good Doctor comes up again.
              (then)
          Please sit down.

                    CAROL
          He's asked me to come and see you.

Beynon looks at her... then lets their eyes meet.

                    BEYNON
              (handing her a drink)
          Why? Can I help?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              8.
CONTINUED:


                    CAROL
          Yes, I think you can.

A MAN'S FINGERS STARING AT THE ANKLET ON THE WOMAN'S LEG then
drawing an imaginary line upward... a woman's hand wearing a
wedding ring comes up to meet it.

INT. SANDERSON PRISON OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY

A UNIFORMED GUARD LEADS DOC DOWN THE HALLWAY, they turn a
corner and go into a small private room, Doc is now dressed
in civilian clothes.

Doc catches sight of himself in a small mirror. He stops
looking uncertainly at the image... and then moves on with
the guard.

EXT. PRISON - DAY

DOC EXITS THE PRISON AND STANDS WAITING NEAR THE AUTO GATE.
He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along the
edge of the penitentiary... Doc turns, looks again at the
prison... four years is a long time.

A dark Caddy is parked down the road.

INT. CADDY - DAY

THE ACCOUNTANT OR SWAIN SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL. He stares at
Doc. Doc crosses to him.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Mr. Beynon will see you the day after
          tomorrow 12:30 at the River Walk.

He gestures and drives away.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

DOC IS STILL WAITING

He leans against a low stone wall that lines the entrance
way... The duffel bag rests beside him.

A late model Ford approaches, stops near Doc... the passenger
side door opens from the inside... Carol is driving... Doc
and Carol look at one another, their eyes holding several
moments.

INT. FORD - DAY

                                                              9.



BOTH CAROL AND DOC ARE VERY TENSE.

                     CAROL
           Hello, Doc.

                        DOC
           Hi.

                        CAROL
           You okay?

                      DOC
                (big smile)
           I'm a lot better off than I was an hour
           ago.

They look at each other for a moment. Carol leans forward...
Doc, inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls, kisses
her lightly, but with affection...

                     CAROL
           You want to drive?

                     DOC
           My license expired, let's get out of
           here.

                        CAROL
           Sure...

She starts the car, slips it into gear.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE FORD MOVES ALONG THE DESERTED ROADSIDE, crossing the
border and passing into the State of Texas.

INT. THE FORD

DOC ALTERNATELY STARES AT THE PASSING SCENERY, THEN BACK to
Carol.

                     CAROL
           I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair
           done... the girl was slow.

                     DOC
           It looks fine.

A pause.

                        CAROL
           Feel good?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            10.

                    DOC
          Yeah.

                    CAROL
          Where do you want to go?

                    DOC
          I want to take a walk.

He smiles, then reaches over and gently touches a strand of
Carol's hair.

EXT. RIVER - GRASSY BANK - SERIES OP ANGLES - DAY

THEY PARK THE CAR AND EXIT. DOC MOVES A LITTLE AHEAD OF
Carol. He sits on the bank watching the kids play.

YOUNG BOYS SWING ON A ROPE THAT HANGS OVER THE PALLS

COLLEGE KIDS, SOME ARE SWIMMING, SOME STUDYING, SOME just
grooving.

AN OLDER COUPLE SIT ON THE BANK, THEIR FEET IN THE WATER

CAROL SITS DOWN NOT TOO CLOSE. DOC IS SILENT FOR LONG
moments. Carol starts to speak but doesn't. He is
preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts.

Finally he stands, looking down at her. He slowly takes off
his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and
starts walking towards a tree.

Suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives
for the rope.

CAROL IS ALREADY ON HER FEET, HER SWEATER OFF, SHOES kicked
aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward
splash. She is a brief second behind him.

THEY COME UP TOGETHER, AND HE LAUGHS WITH THE PURE JOY of
being free and alive. She joins him, in his laughter and with
their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept
down stream.

INT. EL OSO CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW A PORTION OF THE EXTERIOR BUILDING CAN
BE SEEN... The interior is cozy and Carol. Carol has lived
here almost two years. On the wall there is a poster (which
will be on the wall of every room that they stay in from now
on).



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.
CONTINUED:


Around the room are drying clothes. Carol is ironing with a
steam iron.

Doc is sitting at a table with a Colt .45 in front of him and
a .32 automatic. He is field stripping. There is a bowl of
peaches on the table.

                    DOC
              (pointing to the poster)
          It doesn't look like that.

                    CAROL
          What do you mean? You've never been
          there.

                    DOC
          I've been there every day for the last
          four years.

She crosses to him and gives him a hug, then returns to her
ironing.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          What's Beynon got set up?

                    CAROL
          Small town, small bank, big money.

She holds up some 11 by 14 photographs in front of him.

                    DOC
          Where did you get those?

                    CAROL
          I've been doing my homework.

                    DOC
          Just like old times?

                    CAROL
          Better than old times.

                    DOC
          I hope so. I am not looking forward to
          another stretch.

                    CAROL
          I made a mistake. I'll never make another
          one.

                    DOC
              (after a moment)
          Where did you get them developed?

          Assumed name... Houston.

                    DOC
          Good.

RAFTER A MOMENT)

How much is the score?

                    CAROL
          Half a million.

                    DOC
          That Beynon's got a long arm.

                    CAROL
              (after a moment)
          What do you want for dinner?

                    DOC
          Whisky and a peach.

She laughs softly, and goes to a cupboard and takes out four
bottles of whisky, four glasses and a bowl of ice. Doc smiles
at her and begins sampling.

                    CAROL
              (as Doc eats a peach with a
               sharp knife)
          How does it taste?

                    DOC
          Just the way I remembered.

Doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          You been okay?

                    CAROL
          Pretty good... Made a quick trip to
          Oregon, saw my brother and the kids.
          Figured it would be my last chance,
          unless they wanted to travel.

                    DOC
          How's Estelle?

              (carefully)
          That's not all of it.

                    CAROL
          No. It's been a long time.

A pause. He continues stroking her arm.

                    DOC
          You go out much?

                    CAROL
          After four years and now the question
          comes up.

                    DOC
          Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.

                    CAROL
              (with warmth and a smile)
          I'm still here, Doc.

He stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward
the stairs.

INT. BEDROOM

THEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLE
bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she
stares vacantly expectant.

Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with
agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping
Doc drop the garment down to her waist.

Doc hesitates, then carefully touches her shoulder... her
hair... he kisses her... Doc gently eases himself away from
Carol.

                    DOC
              (he is very tight)
          Oh Christ...

He again moves close... Doc reaches around to unsnap her bra
as Carol places both of her arms around him, holding him
tightly...

CONTINUED:

Doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains
unyielding... He closes his eyes for a second... The pressure
of the moment is again too intense for Doc. Once more he
pulls gently away from her. Carol looks at him, her eyes very
reassuring.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          I guess I'm kind of...

          It's all right.

                    DOC
              (explaining the obvious)
          It's just been a while.

                    CAROL
          We've got time. We've got a lot of time.
          I can help you.

She stands, begins to remove her skirt.

                    DOC
          Wait... give me a minute.

                    CAROL
          Sure.

She sits beside him again, takes his hand in hers...

                    DOC
          I'll be okay.

                    CAROL
          Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.

          Really?

                    CAROL
          Really.

They look at one another. A pause. He kisses her; their
embrace pulls them back across the bed.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Let me make you feel good, Doctor.

But she has little chance as he begins to make love to her.

She exits and returns with some clothes. He looks at them.

          Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what
          I've got.

They start eating.

A pause. Carol looks directly at Doc.

          $250,000 right off the top.

          Is he straight?

                    CAROL
          You got the parole, didn't you?

He picks up a fork and looks through it, as if it is prison
bars. She takes his hand and gently takes the fork from him.

          I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just
          thinking of you made me laugh. I had a
          lot of that. And other times that wasn't
          enough. I had a lot of that too. I know
          you find it hard to believe, I'm happy
          just loving you.

Pedal boats cut through the water in the background.

The Accountant and Swain are with Beynon in the boat. Apart

                                                            27.



INT. PANEL TRUCK

DOC SHIFTS HIS POSITION SLIGHTLY, THEN   PULLS HIS .45 OUT from
beneath his jacket. Doc breaks out the   clip, examines it,
snaps it back to position. He replaces   the gun under his
jacket -- the gesture seemingly more a   mannerism than a
precaution.

A huge pair of tongs and the massive wire cutters rest on the
floor of the truck near Doc, along with a black leather
suitcase.

CAROL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, Beacon City appears on the
horizon through the windshield...

INT. BANK

THE PRESIDENT BEGINS TURNING THE COMBINATION on the massive
door as the vault begins to open...

RUDY - IN THE BUICK - DRIVING DOWN THE ROADWAY near the
outskirts of town. A Texas Highway Patrol car passes, moving
in the opposite direction...

JACKSON - IN THE HAY TRUCK - PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES,
then checks his watch.

A WATCH FACE SHOWS THE TIME AT 8:56.

THE WATCH BELONGS TO DOC. He looks expectantly towards Carol.

THE PANEL TRUCK is now within the commercial district of
Beacon City. Rudy's Buick is visible a hundred yards behind.

THE HAY TRUCK drives off Main Street and into an open field
near a corner of the town.

Jackson jumps down out of the cab of the truck and crosses to
the sidewalk.

Rudy's Buick pulls over and Jackson gets into the passenger
seat. The Buick then cruises back out onto Main Street...

CAROL - IN THE VAN - APPROACHES AN INTERSECTION. Through the
truck's window a traffic signal appears.

RUDY PULLS THE BUICK OFF THE MAIN DRAG and onto a side
street. Another turn and he again moves parallel to the Main
Street...

                                                           28.



INT. BANK

THE BANK PRESIDENT LEAVES THE VAULT, allowing the heavy door
to stand open.

A LATTICE-WORK BARRIER made of wrought-iron is pulled across
the vault opening... the Bank President snaps the latch-lock
closed.

CAROL - IN THE PANEL TRUCK. She pulls the van carefully to a
stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red... She
turns her eyes back to Doc...

DOC, CATCHES HER LOOK, then instantly springs into action. He
reaches down, pulls a hatch-like cover up from the floor of
the truck, revealing the road below... a portion of a manhole
cover is visible.

                      DOC
                (barking the words)
            Two feet forward...

CAROL ROLLS THE TRUCK SLIGHTLY FORWARD

ON THE STREET - SEVERAL CARS can be seen moving up behind the
panel truck.

DOC GRABS THE TONGS, inserts the ends into the manhole cover
notches. He lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover
forward. Doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into
open manhole, carrying the huge cutters with him. As he
disappears from sight...

98 RUDY DRIVING ON THE SIDE AVENUE, still moving parallel 98
to Main Street. The Buick is now geographically well forward
of the panel truck. Jackson stares at his watch.

                      JACKSON
            Now!

Rudy makes a sharp left. The car accelerates, its wheels
begin to quietly whine.

Main Street comes back into view...

CAROL WATCHING THE SIGNAL... still red...

A MAN IN A PONTIAC eases to a stop behind the panel truck. He
watches the signal.

DOC STANDING IN THE SEWER PIPE. He turns on a flashlight,
moves ahead. His feet slosh through the six-inch-high murky
water.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             29.
CONTINUED:

Doc shines the light on several ankle-thick conduit lines
that run along the sewer wall... He moves down the dark oval
corridor...

EXT. THE BANK

THE GUARD OPENS THE FRONT DOOR, allowing the morning PATRONS
to enter.

INT. THE BANK

THE PRESIDENT SMILES UPON SEEING THE CUSTOMERS. He looks over
to the wood-frame clock on the far wall.

THE CLOCK READS 9:00 EXACTLY

RUDY - IN THE BUICK - MAKES ANOTHER LEFT TURN, now back onto
Main Street.

THE BANK APPEARS A HALF-BLOCK AWAY through the car window.
Rudy and Jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces;
the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a
disparity between their features...

MAIN STREET - THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL has now blinked to green.

CAROL IS GRINDING AWAY AT THE DEAD ENGINE of the panel
truck...

THE MAN IN THE PONTIAC leans on his HORN... other cars behind
him begin to HONK.

CAROL LEANS OUT OF THE CAB OF THE PANEL TRUCK and gestures
for the cars to pass her. She again GRINDS away at the
engine.

DOC'S WATCH - SHOWING 9:01.

DOC STANDS AT A MASSIVE CONNECTING BOX where four 112 strands
of the conduit intersect. He puts the wire cutters to the
first conduit, grasps the insulated handles and with a
crunching POP, he cuts through the conduit with one bite. Doc
immediately starts on the next strand.

CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.

THE BUICK SLAMS TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE BANK. Rudy Il4 and
Jackson pull open the car doors.

DOC CUTTING THE LAST AND LARGEST CONDUIT.

                                                             30.



INT. THE BANK

THE BANK GUARD is placing a local high school basketball
schedule and display into position.

SEVERAL PATRONS have formed small lines and are transacting
business with the Tellers.

The wall clock shows the time at 9:02.

RUDY AND JACKSON BURST THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR. They stand
shoulder to shoulder, guns extended the full length of their
arms. Beneath the mask Rudy's smile is visible.

THE BANK GUARD LOOKS UP PROM THE BASKETBALL DISPLAY. His eyes
widen... both guns are leveled directly at him...
simultaneously the lights go out...

THE BANK PRESIDENT DESPERATELY PUSHES THE ALARM BUTTON near
his desk. (INSERT: Button and bell.) Nothing happens.

CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.

INT. A DENTIST'S OFFICE

THE D.D.S. TORTURES A BALDING PATIENT with a drill. The
PATIENT groans, lifts one leg in the air from the pain.

When the power goes, the Dentist quizzically raises the drill
and examines it. The Patient pants in relief.

                    DENTIST
          Superior technology, my ass.

AN ELECTRIC WEATHER/TIME INDICATOR - above the town square...
as the bulbs dim...

DOC RUNNING DOWN THE SEWER; stopping at the manhole he
scrambles up the permanent ladderway, tossing his wire
cutters up into the truck parked over him.

CAROL - IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT - again she tries to start the
engine.

DOC PULLING HIMSELF BACK UP INTO THE VAN with a gymnastic
thrust he quickly slides the manhole cover with the tongs.

CAROL - the engine still won't start.

DOC DROPS THE HATCH DOOR back down into place on the floor of
the truck...



                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             31.

                       DOC
                 (snapping his look to Carol)
             Okay.

CAROL TURNS THE IGNITION SWITCH BACK ON...

CAROL - AS THE ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE she engages the
gearshift. The truck begins to move forward. Suddenly, the
motor does STALL.

DOC'S PACE TIGHTENS. The cars behind the van continue
HONKING.

CAROL - AGAIN GRINDING AWAY AT THE ENGINE. Her lips are
compressed into a thin line... After a moment... the motor
catches, the truck again moves forward.

DOC PICKS UP THE LARGE BLACK SUITCASE from the floor of the
panel truck, then begins to move toward the cab and Carol.

THE PANEL TRUCK WHIPS OFF MAIN STREET and onto a side avenue.
Carol pulls the van up to the curbway, jerking to a stop.

DOC IS NOW IN THE FRONT SEAT BESIDE CAROL. He pulls the truck
door open, then hesitates. He touches her arm, their eyes
meet briefly, both their faces warming for a moment. Doc
gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck.

ON THE SIDEWALK

DOC TURNS AND BEGINS WALKING toward an open alleyway. Behind
him the panel truck pulls smoothly away.

WALKING UP THE ALLEY - DOC PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES.
He turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side alley.

The alley opens at one end onto a back street; the opposite
end is bounded by a large brick building. Doc removes his
pistol from his coat pocket, then approaches a doorway along
the side of the brick building. At the last moment he pulls
down the watch cap mask.

INT. BANK

RUDY DISENGAGES THE LATCH on the side door.

EXT. ALLEY

DOC KICKS THE DOOR OPEN with a violent jerk of his leg.

                                                            32.



INT. THE BANK

RUDY'S GUN IS TRAINED PROM THE BACK OF THE BUILDING over the
Tellers and Patrons, spread-eagled across the floor. Their
heads are down; several of them are trembling.

DOC STANDS HOLDING THE .45 IN ONE HAND, suitcase in the
other. He moves into the building, shutting the door behind
him.

RUDY IS NOW STATIONED NEAR THE FRONT DOOR, ready to intercept
any incoming bank patrons -- he covers the room from the end
opposite Jackson.

Rudy stands near the Bank Guard's outstretched right hand --
The Guard's head is bloodied from Rudy's pistol whipping. His
gun has been kicked against the wall. A short distance away
Rudy is watching.

THE BANK PRESIDENT lies face down on the floor, directly
under the arc of Jackson's gun... who is continually turning
to watch the Guard.

DOC QUICKLY CROSSES THE DISTANCE between the side door and
the vault, passing the Bank President. He slips the .45 into
his jacket side pocket, sets down the suitcase, then either
cuts the lock or picks it.

                    RUDY
              (looking at his watch)
          19 seconds.

CAROL - IN THE VAN - She has stopped the panel truck near the
deserted lot where the hay truck is parked.

She drops the bomb-laden grocery bag inside the truckbed. She
moves back towards the van...

IN THE BANK

DOC FINISHES,, RIPS THE DOOR OPEN, lifts the suitcase and
moves into the vault.

RUDY LOOKS AT THE BLOODIED GUARD, notes the distance
separating the man from his gun. Though unconscious, the
Guard's head begins to move.

JACKSON HOLDS HIS GUN HAND FULLY EXTENDED. Again he takes a
brief moment to glance nervously over to the open vault and
at the Guard.

ANGLES AND INSERTS - THE VAULT is lined with safety deposit
boxes and large cabinet drawers.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             33.
CONTINUED:


A metal table stands off-center, the black suitcase resting
on its surface. Doc opens the satchel. He then pulls open one
of the cabinet drawers nearby and begins tossing banded money
pads into the open suitcase.

THE BANK PRESIDENT LIES NEAR THE OPEN VAULT. He listens to
the SOUNDS of Doc at work. He slightly cranes his neck,
trying to get a look at the thief inside the vault.

RUDY WATCHING THE FRONT DOOR. A PATRON enters; Rudy gestures
with the gun... she hits the deck.

JACKSON IS GETTING MORE NERVOUS by the minute...

DOC continues working within the vault.

THE WOMAN, now on the floor, quietly crying.

JACKSON watching the Guard.

RUDY watching Jackson. Calling out time.

THE BANK GUARD, glassy-eyed, but conscious; he has the look
of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout, but is
ready for one more round.

THE BANK PRESIDENT in his prone position. He looks at
Jackson, then to the vault.

THE PANEL TRUCK - now at the other end of Main Street.

CAROL EXITS THE VAN, carries the second sack to a large
rubbish bin in front of an empty store. She deposits the
grocery bag...

DOC WORKING. The suitcase is now filled. He snaps the
fasteners shut .

DOC EXITS THE VAULT after withdrawing his .45 from his coat
pocket .

JACKSON SEES DOC LEAVE THE VAULT. He edges around the side of
the tellers' cages toward the front of the bank.

DOC MOVES TOWARDS JACKSON'S OLD VANTAGE POINT NEAR THE SIDE
DOOR. He passes the bank president.

RUDY NOW WATCHES DOC

DOC CARRIES THE HEAVY SUITCASE IN HIS LEFT HAND. He gestures
to Rudy and Jackson with his pistol while moving towards the
side door.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             34.
CONTINUED:


JACKSON HALF RUNS PASSING RUDY ON HIS WAY TO THE FRONT
ENTRANCE still watching the Bank Guard.

THE BANK GUARD STILL PUNCH DRUNK PULLS HIMSELF UP TO HIS
HANDS and knees... the Guard looks at his pistol.

DOC STOPS AT THE KICKED IN SIDE DOOR. HE COVERS THE ENTIRE
bank with his gun.

THE BANK GUARD BEGINS TO CRAWL WITH AGONIZING SLOWNESS
towards his pistol.

RUDY EYES STILL ON DOC

JACKSON NOW AT THE FRONT DOOR IS PARALYZED WATCHING THE
GUARD.

DOC GESTURES TO RUDY AND JACKSON TO GET MOVING.

EXT. STREET - DAY

CAROL PARKS THE VAN, CROSSES TO A FORD, GETS IN, DRIVES AWAY.

INT. BANK

THE GUARD HAS MORE THAN HALF CLOSED THE DISTANCE TO THE .38.

JACKSON LEVELS HIS .44.

DOC AND RUDY. BOTH SEE WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

                      DOC
                (shouts)
            Just pick it up.

                      RUDY
            Don't!

JACKSON PULLS THE TRIGGER THREE TIMES.

THE BANK GUARD'S BODY turns end-over-end from Jackson's
bullets. Some of the bank Patrons SCREAM, others SOB with
fright.

DOC - His eyes are furious.

RUDY AND JACKSON - Rudy shoves Jackson out the front door.

DOC COVERS THEIR EXIT, then slips out the side door and into
the alley.

                                                             35.



EXT. MAIN STREET

RUDY GUNS THE BUICK FORWARD, the wheels tearing at the
asphalt. Jackson's shoulders rock back as the big car
accelerates.

                    THE ALLEY
          DOC, GUN AND SUITCASE IN HAND, nears the
          end of the alleyway.

CAROL - IN A FORD - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway
opening.

DOC TOSSES THE SUITCASE into the back of the car... then
slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel
as Carol slides over to the passenger seat.

INT. THE FORD

DOC PULLS OFF THE WATCH CAP MASK; his face taut.

THE FORD SMOKES OFF as Doc kicks it into gear...

MAIN STREET BEACON CITY A SERIES OF ANGLES

THE BUICK STREAKS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE ROADWAY... Two bombs
detonate into fireballs... The Hay truck blazes upward, bales
instantly igniting.

The grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange-
flame inferno...

Traffic stalls on the boulevard; Drivers and Pedestrians gawk
at the twin blazes.

RUDY ZIG ZAGS THE BUICK ALONG. Maneuvering through the
stopped traffic.

DOC SLIDES THE FORD THROUGH A RIGHT AND LEFT TURN, emerging
onto smoke-covered Main Street.

The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins
out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood
bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the
grass of a small park.

INT. FORD '

DOC LOOKS MORE THAN A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AS CAROL STARES

AT him.

POLICE CARS ROAR BY THEM.

                                                           36.



EXT. SMALL PARK

DOC ZIPS THE CAR OFF THE GRASS AND BACK ONTO THE TRAFFIC
CLOGGED ROADWAY.

RUDY DRIVING THROUGH THE BEDLAM. Suddenly a gun appears in
his right hand, aimed at Jackson. The pistol roars bucks,
roars, bucks again. Jackson is shot through the head twice.

THE FORD IS SEVERAL BLOCKS BEHIND RUDY. DOC DOWNSHIFTS
avoiding stalled cars. Carol grasps at both the seat and the
dashboard handholds to maintain her balance.

THE BUICK EMERGES THROUGH DENSE PLUMES OF SMOKE. Fire licks
along the one edge of the sidewalk.

RUDY IN THE BUICK HAS NOW ALMOST CLEARED THE TOWN. He tears
along the highway... sweating a little but becoming cool. He
is a pro. His watch cap is now removed.

ON THE CURVE - Jackson's body is kicked out of the automobile
and bounces across the pavement.

DOC IN THE FORD POWERS ALONG. He approaches the flaming
building, then hits the brakes as ...

A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite
direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying
to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street .

DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the
smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four
wheel drift. Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the
sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars,
through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign,
then bores back onto the road.

RUDY IN THE BUICK STROKING ALONG THE OPEN HIGHWAY. Looks in
the rear view mirror.

RUDY'S POV - THROUGH THE BUICK'S REAR WINDOW, BLACK smoke is
visible billowing skyward.

DOC AND CAROL IN THE FORD NOW DRIVING CALMLY THROUGH the
countryside. A police car with light turning and siren
wailing passes them, heading for the conflagration in Beacon
City. Doc's eyes follow the Patrol Car until it disappears
from sight.

THE BUICK - SERIES OF ANGLES - IT pulls off the highway and
bumps down a dirt road. Rudy strains to hold the big car on
the rutted pathway.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             37.
CONTINUED:


The dirt road becomes a lane.

A farm house and barn appear at a clearing. Rudy powers the
car up a fairly steep hill, the crest of which is occupied by
a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn.

RUDY JUMPS OUT OF THE BUICK, trots to the front of the barn
and pulls the double-doors open. A station wagon with wooden-
panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within...

THE FORD SWEEPS OFF THE HIGHWAY and onto the dirt road.

WITHIN THE FORD - DOC IS DRIVING. Carol peels off her
sweater. She has worn a faded blouse underneath... She pulls
a ribbon; her hair falls changing her appearance.

RUDY - IN THE BARN - The Buick is now parked near the Station
Wagon. Standing in the shadows, he intently reloads his gun,
then moves towards the large doors of the barn.

CAROL - IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE FORD - she watches as
Doc drives up the lane...

RUDY stands outside the barn as the car approaches.

DOC STUDIES RUDY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, watching him wipe
his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer...

INT. BARN

DOC PULLS THE FORD TO A STOP just within the double doors. He
passes Rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway
station wagon.

DOC JUMPS OUT OF THE FORD AS SOON AS the ignition switch is
cut; Carol a beat behind him on the opposite side.

Rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors.
He stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks
around him.

Doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to Rudy.
He reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase,
not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained
a great weight.

                      DOC
                (speaking over his shoulder,
                 not looking at Rudy)
            Where's Jackson?

Rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             38.
CONTINUED:


                    RUDY
              (pointing his gun lazily at
               Doc, supremely confident)
          He didn't make it, Doc... you didn't
          either.

Doc straightens, still holding the suitcase. He starts to
turn to Rudy, eyes wide, helpless. Carol fumbles for the gun
in her purse.

Rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution. Doc
swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face
Rudy's bullets... then he shoots Rudy in the middle of the
chest, Doc's .45 slug driving him backward.

Doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel. He
drops the suitcase with his first shot, FIRES again, blasting
Rudy in the middle. Two large holes now show at the chest of
Rudy's raincoat.

Rudy is knocked back over the hillock, tumbling down the
precipice and into a grassy meadow below. Doc stands at the
crest of the hill. He looks down as Rudy's body stops
turning. Doc shifts the .45 to his right hand.

Rudy's body lies still.

DOC TURNS QUICKLY AWAY PROM THE HILLTOP, not giving Rudy's
body a second glance. Carol, gun in hand, stands outside the
barn, transfixed.

                    CAROL
          How did you know?

Doc doesn't answer, motioning her into the car... the getaway
car... as she starts to change clothes... he reloads. Doc
takes a long look at Carol.

THEY GET IN THE CAR AND LEAVE.

EXT. BOTTOM OP HILL - DAY

CAROL IS DRIVING., tooling comfortably along a country road.
Doc is beside her, the suitcase resting in the back seat.
After several moments of silence:

                    CAROL
          What about the bank?

                    DOC
              (after a moment)
          Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          39.
CONTINUED:


Carol takes a deep breath,, then turns her look at the side
window.

                    CAROL
          Oh, Christ.

Doc leans forward., snaps on the radio.

EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY

RUDY BUTLER STUMBLES BACK OVER THE CREST OP THE HILLOCK and
onto the pathway in front of the barn. His figure is slightly
grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's .45 slugs,
along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on
his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill. He is
obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch.

EXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - DAY

RUDY TURNS ON A RUSTED TAP which sends all-pocketed water
gurgling down into a mold-covered trough. Rudy pulls off the
yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the
padded bullet-proof vests. Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall
to his feet. A huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone.

RUDY TOUCHES THE BLOOD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, then looks at his
hand. Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash
the purling water across his face and then he laughs.

INT. STATION WAGON - DAY

DIALOGUE COMES ON THE RADIO DESCRIBING THE ROBBERY. $750,000
stolen.

                    DOC
          We got between four and five.

Carol starts to open the bag and count.

Doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing. Doc
reflectively studies the roadside ahead. They are heading
along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that
carries only a sparse amount of traffic.

Doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead.

                    CAROL
              (now noticing the road)
          Doc...

                     DOC
              (flat)
          I see it...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             40.
CONTINUED:


ON THE ROAD AHEAD HIGHWAY PATROLMEN HAVE FORMED a traffic
barricade. Several cars and trucks are being waved through
the check-point. Wearing sunglasses and Stetson hats, the
Uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing
vehicle.

DOC ANALYZES THE SITUATION WITHOUT CHANGING EXPRESSION He
slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line
of slowly-passing vehicles.

She turns, starts to reach into the back. Doc gently catches
her arm, preventing her from moving further.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          They're looking for three men...
          remember?

A YOUNG OFFICER looks into the cab of the pickup, then
glances at the empty flatbed. Another PATROLMAN flanks the
other side of the truck, repeating the procedure. Several
Patrol Cars, fully loaded with additional OFFICERS, are
parked nearby. The pickup truck is waved through. The station
wagon rolls up to the check-point.

DOC ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW. He smiles and nods to the Young
Patrolman.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (big smile)
          What's the problem?

CAROL STUDIES THE OFFICER on her side of the car through the
closed window... the Officer peers back at her then into the
rear seat.

THE STATION WAGON is waved ahead without a second glance by
the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock...
After a moment, Doc leans forward, snapping on the radio.

EXT. THE FARM - RUDY - DAY

Inside the barn, behind the wheel of the panel truck, Rudy's
matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face. He
starts the engine, painfully bringing it to a ROAR. The panel

The wagon continues moving down the road.

EXT. A NARROW DIRT ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

TWO HOURS BEFORE SUNSET. A CHILL SOUTHWEST WIND is blowing.
The station wagon appears, moving slowly down the roadway,
bouncing along its rutted surface.

AT A SMALL INTERSECTION TWO MAIL BOXES STAND CLOSE to one
another. The name Beynon is printed in black paint on one of
the letter bins. Doc stops the wagon momentarily, looks at
the box, then turns down the indicated road.

EXT. THE STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON

THE STATION WAGON clears the crest of a sage brush hill and
passes camera.

INT. STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON

DOC PARKS THE WAGON UNDER A GNARLED COTTONWOOD TREE in front
of the house. As he shuts off the engine, he pulls the .45
out of his coat pocket and shoves it into his waistband.
Carol watches the gesture. Doc starts to open the car door,
then hesitates.

                    DOC
          You can wait here... I'll wrap it up
          fast.

DOC STEPS OUT OF THE WAGON, then pulls the leather suitcase
out of the back. He quietly shuts the car door and moves
around the side of the house, toward the barn/garage at the
rear.

HE LOOKS CAREFULLY around the area, his eyes searching for
signs of Beynon's men. Nothing seemingly amiss, he moves
toward the front door, tries it, moves away.

Doc crosses to the back screen door of the house. After
another moment, Doc quietly opens the screen door and enters
the house.

INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

DOC MOVES THROUGH THE SERVICE PORCH/PANTRY and into the
kitchen.

                                                          44.



INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON - LATE AFTERNOON/NIGHT

BEYNON SITS AT THE LONG KITCHEN TABLE] head on hand, eyes
slightly glared... on the checkered oilcloth in front of him
is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full. He's drinking
the sour mash straight with a water chaser.

DOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase
down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass
and sits down at the table. Doc pours himself a drink, takes
a sip.

                    BEYNON
          Hello, McCoy.

          News said two persons killed.

Except for a faint thickness of speech, Beynon seems quite
sober. Beynon wears a .38 Detective Special C.T.G. in a worn
leather belly holster.

          That's right.

Doc looks at Beynon, notes his gun, then continues stacking
the money.

          What about your wife?

          No way. I always do my own work.

Beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's
glass.

                    BEYNON
          Here. I understand the way you feel. As a
          matter of fact, you and I might share a
          great many feelings...

Beynon drinks from his glass. Doc continues counting the
money.

              (snaps the words)
          I'm in a hurry.

          operator you are.

                    DOC
          No applause!

Beynon pauses a moment. Doc looks steadily across the table
into BeynonTs eyes. Prom beyond there might be the quiet
sound of a screen door opening. Beynon gets out of the chair,
stands beside the table.

          the woman's husband, a skillful bank
          robber serving a long sentence in prison.
          Three, a man with political influence, a
          man who can easily get a parole for a
          convict... why should he?

Beynon sips his glass slowly. Doc's hand edges down toward
his waist band.

                    BEYNON (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious
          reason. To rob a bank.

          strings I pulled.

                    DOC
          I bet.

Doc senses a movement from the shadows behind Beynon. Turning
his head slightly, Doc can see Carol standing at the entrance
to the kitchen. She holds a .32 automatic... the pistol seems
to be pointed directly at Doc.

                    BEYNON
          You wouldn't have come here when you were
          eight3 Mr. McCoy.

As the gun continues to be pointed directly at Doc.

                    BEYNON (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Don't think too badly of her... After
          all, you were in jail a long time and she
          is a healthy young woman.

              (riding over Beynon's words)
          Get it over with...

CAROL FIRES the automatic. The big gun belches the full slip
in a stuttering EXPLOSION... the slide remains back and in an
ejected position.

BEYNON is driven back to the kitchen wall. He SHRIEKS aloud,
the noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens
against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore
slugs... Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned
table. He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body. Carol takes
two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it
clattering and spinning away across the floor.

DOC looks at Carol, their eyes find each other. He turns,
moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills
a glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at
her.

CAROL stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks.

DOC crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent
shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen
toward the back door. Beynon's body has slipped from sight,
only a few traces of blood show along the white wall.

                                                             48.

Rudy is driving along an open highway. Rudy mouths inane
lyrics to the radio, one arm on the wheel, the other
clutching his wound. A small sign near a mailbox catches

then pulls into the long dirt driveway of an isolated farm
house.

them into a trash bin without missing a stride.

INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING

CAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward.
She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and
her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket
buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical
to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike.
Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend
off into clumped rows within the wings of the station.

CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase
flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in
place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy
item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly
ticket-seller looks across to her.

                    CAROL
          Two day coach tickets -- on the Flyer.

                    TICKET-SELLER
          Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in
          forty-five minutes, gate three.

Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse
along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back
into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the
seemingly acres-wide station promenade.

NEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits
uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests
on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances
across the promenade walls, her eyes finding:

A CLOCK READING: 9:40

ON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER

CAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers
waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her.

Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap,
pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins
rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from
the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather
satchel.

CONTINUED:


CAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the
suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around
her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass-
walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudge
in that direction.

A BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol
approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the
numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small
suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman
quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than
tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps
to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then
studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face
of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens
the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the
locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the
door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her
predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter
out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered
directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder.

THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher
features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap
corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The
Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness.

                    DAPPER MAN
          Kind of tricky, isn't it?

She turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth
movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand,
deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open.
Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests
it to show that it

has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and
puts it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by
the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his
intentions.

                       CAROL
          Thank you.

                    DAPPER MAN
              (toothy grin)
          No trouble lady.

Stepping backward, his canine features disappear into a
welter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure
for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her
purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail
Lounge.

                                                            52.

medical bag. Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn-
like Animal Hospital. The large room is lined with stalls,
cages and pens, many of them vacant.

The wonded criminal is bare-chested. A plaster cast has been
attached to his left arm and shoulder.

FRAN CLINTON SITS ON A HIGH WOODEN STOOL opposite   Rudy. Five
years younger than her husband, tight sweater and   skirt,
bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her   face
suggests sensuality. Fran's bare, milk-white legs   are crossed
under her rumpled skirt.

                    RUDY
              (to Harold)
          What's the damage?

                    HAROLD
          Collar bone is broken. No infection
          yet... the bandages should be changed
          twice a day.

                    RUDY
          I got a nurse in mind.

                    HAROLD
              (going along, oblivious to the
               implication)
          The glucose will begin working in half an
          hour. You'll feel better then...

                     RUDY
              (flashing a grin despite the
               pain)
          The three of us are going to do some
          traveling. We're going to take your car
          to El Paso.

                    HAROLD
          That's not possible. We can't leave
          here... we've got all this.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           53.

Rudy smiles at Mrs. Clinton. He's never met Fran before, but
he's known her for years.

                    RUDY
          Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?

                    FRAN
              (scared, but trying to be
               friendly)
          Just... tell us what you want.

Rudy looks back down at the gun and cat. The following
silence is like a scream. Finally:

                    RUDY
          What kind of car do you have, Harold?

                    FRAN
              (cutting in)
          A Ford... We have a Ford.

                    RUDY
          That's good. That's very good. Now
          Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford,
          check the oil and tires, we don't want
          any problems on the road. One more
          thing... If anybody but you comes back...

He points the gun at Mrs. Clinton.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          She gets her clock fixed right away...
          You understand that, Harold?

A long pause.

                    FRAN
          You do what he says, Harold.

                    RUDY
          After you come back I'll listen while you
          make some phone calls, tell a few friends
          you've got to leave for a week or two...
          You have to call another Vet about the
          animals. You tell him to come over and
          take good care of them starting
          tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got
          to be looked after...

                    HAROLD
          We really don't have too many friends.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             54.

          They don't think he married well.

                    RUDY
              (smiling)
          That makes things a little easier for us
          then, doesn't it?

INT. TRAINS STATION BAR - DAY

Carol sits in the bar. A young SOLDIER approaches and sits
down at the counter next to her. She is finishing a vodka
gimlet.

                    SOLDIER
              (to a bartender)
          Beer.

Carol glances at her watch.

                    SOLDIER (CONT'D)
              (continuing - begins with the
               obvious)
          Guess you have to catch a train?

                    THE SOLDIER
          pink-cheeked and freckle-faced, he has to
          shave maybe twice a week; twenty-one
          years old, not good-looking (his best
          feature is his gentle, easy grin) and not
          a hustler. He just wats to meet a girl.

                    CAROL
              (not too patronizing)
          That's right.

                    SOLDIER
          Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough
          and I'm goin' home.

The soldier's beer arrives.

                    CAROL
          Where's home?

                    SOLDIER
          Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem,
          right near Salt Lake ... Say, you
          wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would
          you?




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          55.

                    CAROL
              (chuckles)
          No, I'm not.

                    SOLDIER
          Me, neither. There's about twelve people
          in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm
          one of them.

                     CAROL
          That certainly makes you kind of
          special...

                    SOLDIER
              (awkward)
          Yeah... I guess it does.

Carol pushes aside her glass.

                    SOLDIER (CONT'D)
              (c ont inuing)
          You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt
          Lake, would you?

                    CAROL
              (smiles across to him)
          No, I'm afraid not.

                    SOLDIER
          I never have any luck.

Carol smiles at the soldier. Her features suddenly freeze as
she glances toward the entrance to the bar.

AT THE DOORWAY

DOC STANDS LOOKING AT CAROL and the soldier.

                    CAROL
          STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          I really hope you have a nice trip.

                    SOLDIER
          Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

Carol moves towards the exit.

The soldier quietly sips his beer, his face a bit grim.

AT THE DOORWAY

                                                             56.



CAROL STOPS NEAR DOC.

They look at each other...

                    DOC
          Where's the suitcase?

Carol continues looking at Doc for a moment.

Then, suddenly moves past him, leading him out into the main
lobby.

                                       BACK WITHIN THE PROMENADE

SERIES OF ANGLES

CAROL EMERGES FROM THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE followed by Doc.

They cross to the lockers.

She retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the
proper slot. It doesn't turn. Puzzled she tries again, then
forcing the key, shakes the lock violently.

Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the
locker number and then the number on the key. Her features
are now totally ashen.

She walks up the bank of lockers... puts the key in another
locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty.

Carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear...
Doc at her shoulder.

                    CAROL
          A man helped me open it...

                    DOC
              (deceptive calm)
          And switched keys.

                    CAROL
          He must have.

                    DOC
              (angrily)
          It isn't another boyfriend, is it?

Carol winces, containing her anger.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - icily)
          How long ago.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            57.

                    CAROL
          Fifteen minutes.

                    DOC
          Sure?

Carol nods.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - with quick
               calculation)
          He'd figure you for longer, enough time
          to try another hit. He's probably still
          in the station.

As Doc pushes Carol forward.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - lashing out)
          There better be a guy with the

                    CAROL
              (lashing back)
          You bastard...

Walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc
forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow. They
reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the
promenade... eyes straining.

CAROL STOPS SUDDENLY. SHE STARES DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR her
eyes finding the thief. He stands near another bank of
lockers, the black suitcase at his feet.

THE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same
moment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He
takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement
that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag
and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons.

DOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves
immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to
keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of
lockers.

CAROL ROUNDS THE LAST LOCKER IN THE ROW but both men have now
disappeared from view. She sags back against the edge of the
metal compartments, exhausted, fearful.

                    LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
              (indistinct above the roar of
               the station)
          Attention please.

                    LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (CONT'D)
          The Flyer now boarding at gate three. The
          Flyer now boarding at gate three.

Carol again raises her eyes. Still breathless, her face glows
with moisture.

INT. THE CLINTON'S BARN - (MORNING)

FRAN IS STILL SEATED ON THE STOOL. Rudy stares at her from
the cot. Harold is now absent.

                    FRAN
          I don't think you have to worry much
          about Harold. He won't do anything.

                    RUDY
              (he speaks very politely)
          That right?

                    FRAN
          You can trust him...

                    RUDY
          How long have you been married?

                       FRAN
          Two years.

                    RUDY
          Can he trust you?

                    FRAN
              (smiles)
          That's what matters, isn't it?

Rudy continues looking at her.

                    RUDY
          Come over here a minute...

He gestures with his gun. Fran crosses the distance slowly,
moving with apprehension.

                     FRAN
          Look, I'm not going to be any trouble to
          you either, fact is, this may sound
          funny, but maybe you and I could be close
          friends...

Rudy gestures her closer...




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             59.
CONTINUED:


                    FRAN (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          You don't always have to have your gun
          out. I'll get whatever you want. Really,
          I will...

Fran smiles. She is now standing over the cot, looking
directly down at Rudy. He jerks her down.

                    RUDY
              (still polite)
          Get rid of that nail polish, I don't like
          it, and when I tell you to come over here
          you move fast. You and I are going to get
          along because I've known a lot of people
          like you, so don't tell me about it
          because I got your ticket going in. Now
          get up and get that paint of your
          fingers... okay?

Rudy smiles.

INT. TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY

DOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of
lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes
in.

After a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked
locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the
slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse.
Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station
is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move
carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make
themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference.

THE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between
the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long
corridor.

DOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed
off departure/arrival gates.

THE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open
stairway winding downward.

DOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area
where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the
loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't
surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps
behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or
two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and
starts back up the platform towards the concourse.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             60.
CONTINUED:

Doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief
spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers
scurrying toward the awaiting train...

THE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the
boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the
pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach
passengers.

CAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of
about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight,
visible on the next level below.

THE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the
coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he
speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a
baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and
into the rail car passageway.

DOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the
conductor and into the train.

THE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the
forward compartments.

DOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and
disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car
vestibule.

ON THE CONCOURSE

CAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard
the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look
at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc.
She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will
take her down to trackside...

Carol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd
having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring
down at the shining train.

INT. FLYER - DAY COACH

THE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over
their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks,
clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to
move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried
but controlled pace.

                                                             61.



AT THE END OF A PULLMAN

DOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is
one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact
that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he
passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle.
She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an
overhead carriage.

Doc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her.

30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30?
empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a
run.

DOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR.
The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the
front of the train.

THE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER.
This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace,
swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of
the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move
into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by
the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds
only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car.
The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door,
hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are
tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.

DOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still
unknowingly two cars behind the Thief.

THE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE
SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries
the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks
the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind
him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the
smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door
swings open.

INT. MEN'S LOUNGE

The Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him,
crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window.
He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly
jammed...

DOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen
travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the
smoker.



                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                               62.
CONTINUED:


THE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a
PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes
through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and,
like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage
blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and
begins going back in the opposite direction.

DOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for
a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.

                       PORTER
                 (appearing suddenly at Doc's
                  shoulder)
             Be open five minutes out of the station.

Doc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps
toward his point of entrance onto the train.

THE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing
the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid
pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The
Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves
the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket.

DOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars.

INT. MEN'S LOUNGE

THE THIEF HAS AGAIN CLOSED THE SUITCASE. He nervously looks
about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the
window and stares out through a corner of the pane. He pulls
the shade lower.

EXT. TRACK

METAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS,
then begins to move forward.

THE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the
train edges forward. His body suddenly tightens. He sees Doc
outside the train, walking slowly between a narrow passage of
moving passenger cars and several parked tinders.

                       THIEF'S POV
             DOC GLANCING BETWEEN PARKED PASSENGER
             CARS, walking cautiously ahead. As the
             Flyer continues to move slowly forward,
             Doc disappears from view.

THE THIEF ALLOWS HIMSELF A QUICK SMILE. Turning away from the
window he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps

AT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a
window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair
opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well
behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered
about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of
the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch
tickets.

As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an
abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him.
He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the
paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief
rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then,
Doc sits down next to the Thief.

DOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE
THIEF'S NECK, pulling him close.

                    DOC
              (softly almost gently)
          When you pop a lock don't mark it.

The Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before
he can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms.

THE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND. Doc's
fingers are vise-like at his wrist.

THE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of
the car, taking no note of the quiet encounter.

THE CONDUCTOR IS STILL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CAR from
Doc and the Thief. He continues collecting and punching
fares.

INT. STATION GATE - DAY

CAROL IS EXITING. THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE

LOUDSPEAKER -- the train has left.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

THE CONDUCTOR AS SEEN BY THE THIEF'S WIDENING EYES. He
methodically punches the tickets, never looking more than two
seats ahead.

THE THIEF'S EYES BULGE AS DOC CHOPS HIM ON THE WINDPIPE. The
Thief goes out. Is he dead?

DOC CHOPS HIM AGAIN. IF HE ISN'T DEAD HE LOOKS IT.

Doc pulls the Thief's hat down over his head.

                                                            64.



INT. STATION - DAY

CAROL CROSSES INTO THE STATION, TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

Sits... waiting. The soldier comes by, stops. She doesn't
recognize anything.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

THE CONDUCTOR ARRIVES AT THE LOUNGE CHAIRS WHERE DOC AND THE
thief are seated. He stops in the aisleway, expectantly
leaning in Doc's direction.

                     CONDUCTOR
          Tickets?

As Doc takes out his wallet, peels a fifty out and gives it
to him.

                    DOC
          End of the line. Two.

                     CONDUCTOR
              (grumpily)
          All right.

The conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make
change.

THE THIEF SITS FACING THE WINDOW LOOKING VERY DEAD

INT. CLINTON'S FORD - DAY

RUDY SITS IN THE BACK SEAT AS HAROLD CAUTIOUSLY MOTORS

DOWN the highway. With his one good arm, Rudy cares for the
kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat.

                    RUDY
          Talk a little, Harold, loosen up... good
          for you.

Harold works his jaw, his grip tightens on the wheel.

                    FRAN
              (chuckling at Harold)
          Something ought to loosen him up ... how
          comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?

                    RUDY
          I Just want to find a suitcase.

                                                             65.



INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON'S RANCH - DAY

BEYNON'S BODY REMAINS OUT OF SIGHT behind the overturned
kitchen table... a small trickle of blood oozes out from
under one of the table legs.

The Accountant stands with Cully, Hayhoe and Swain staring
down at Beynon's body.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          They may still be going to Nogales.

                    SWAIN
          What about Laughlin in El Paso?

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Cover both, get someone down there...
          either Rudy and McCoy's got half a
          million.

                    SWAIN
          They've got to switch cars.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Put out the word.

                    HAYHOE
              (looking back at Beynon)
          What about Jack?

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Tonight... take him out in the country,
          throw him down a dry well, if you can
          find one.

INT. PULLMAN CAR - DAY

AS DOC THUMBS IDLY THROUGH THE NEWSPAPER. He is suddenly
showered with spurting water. He lowers the paper and looks
to the aisle, seeing:

A SEVEN YEAR OLD BLACK PANTHER, dressed appropriately and
holding a water pistol.

                    KID
          Stick 'em up!

Doc looks at the brat.

                    KID (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          I'm gonna shoot you...


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            66.
CONTINUED:


He squeezes the pistol's trigger, two bursts of water land on
Doc's shirt front. Doc continues staring at the boy. The kid
looks hard at Doc, not giving an inch.

                    DOC
          Come here a second...

Doc takes the boy's arm, gently pulls him closer.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Look, I'm sure you're a nice kid and that
          your mother's nearby...

Now you better get back to her real quick or I'm going to
break your little arm... okay?

Doc releases the boy. The kid looks at Doc for a moment then
bursts into tears and retreats at a dead run back down the
passenger car aisleway. Doc again lifts the paper, turning to
the sports page.

INT. STATION - DAY

CAROL WAITS IN THE STATION. (A SERIES OP ANGLES AND
DISSOLVES)

INT. PULLMAN - DAY

DOC LIFTS THE SUITCASE AS THE CONDUCTOR APPEARS at the
vestibule at the opposite end of the car and announces the
next stop. Doc prepares to get off. The passenger car remains
sparsely populated. No one occupies the seats near the
corpse.

EXT. FIRST TRAIN CONCOURSE - SERIES OF ANGLES AND DISSOLVES -
EARLY MORNING

CAROL SITS WATCHING THE PEOPLE -- she gets up, doesn't know
where to go... sits down again... fear and anticipation on
her face... stands up... ready to go where? Ready to sit down
again, she looks up.

DOC CROSSES SLOWLY TO HER CARRYING THE SUITCASE. Carol
reacts... pleased to see him... pleased that he's back...
until.

                    DOC
              (steely)
          Your kind of mistakes are going to land
          me back in Huntsville.

                    CAROL
              (nailing him)
          I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get
          you out... I'll screw every prison
          official in Texas if I have to.

                    DOC
          Texas is a big state.

                    CAROL
          I can handle it.

                    DOC
          I'll bet you can.

                     CAROL
          You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you,
          Doc?
               (rising tone)
          If I was caught, wouldn't you?

Doc is silent. After a long pause.

                     CAROL (CONT'D)
              (continuing - quietly)
          When we had trouble before it was
          different.

                    DOC
              (nodding)
          You don't like the way things are, I
          don't like the way things

                    CAROL
          What do you want to do?

                    DOC
          Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the
          money with you.

                    CAROL
          Do you mean that?

                       DOC
          I mean it.

A long pause. Maybe she wonders; what if he is lying but what
if he isn't? Temptation? She makes up her mind.

                    CAROL
          No... I don't want to leave.

                                                           68.



INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - EARLY EVENING

DOC AND CAROL WATCH THROUGH THE DOUBLE WINDOWS AS THE train
yard lights of a town go strobing by.

EXT. SECOND TRAIN CONCOURSE.

DOC AND CAROL COME DOWN OUT OF THE GANGWAY OF ANOTHER train
and turn up the pavement toward the main part of the depot.
Doc continues holding the suitcase as they walk.

                    DOC
          We'll grab a room for tonight then you go
          out tomorrow and buy yourself some new
          clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some
          food now, paper bag it, we eat in the
          room.

                    CAROL
              (cutting in)
          You've got all the answers. What about
          when they find the body on the train?

                    DOC
          When they find it, they find it.

To the cops a description's only good if there's a channel
for it, and there's no connection between that stiff and the
robbery.

                    CAROL
          You've got it all figured.

                    DOC
              (looking at Carol and thinking
               about Beynon)
          No... there's a couple of things I'm
          still working on.

                       CAROL
          Like what?

But Doc doesn't answer.

INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT

DOC LIES NEXT TO CAROL. Carol is eating a hamburger wrapped
in wax paper. She passes one over to Doc along with some
greasy french fries and a couple of napkins .

The Suitcase has been placed on the small writing desk across
the room. Doc silently munches his hamburger.

Doc glances at the poster rolled up. Carol hasn't put it up
on the wall yet.

INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT

THE TRAIN GOES CLICKETY CLICK THROUGH THE NIGHT, the young
panther is stalking and prowling among the sleeping
passengers. His Mother catches him, takes him back to his
seat.

INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT

CAROL IS BUSY UNBANDING THE MONEY PADS. A LARGE STACK OF
discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can near
her leg. Behind her, Doc, now in his undershirt, reads a
Texas newspaper.

CAROL CONTINUES TO LOOSEN THE GREENBACKS. She is surrounded
on the double bed by stacks of money. She lights a match,
drops it into the wastebasket. The money bands quickly burst
into flames, consume themselves, then die back into crinkly
ashes.

                    DOC
              (not looking up)
          There may be a hunting party.

                    CAROL
          Why, there's nothing on the news?

                    DOC
          I didn't mean police.

He continues thinking. Carol watches him for a moment.

                    CAROL
          Tell me about it.

Doc looks across at her.

                    DOC
              (calmly)
          Loredo is out. I've been thinking about
          Rudy. If he was on his own, we're okay.
          If Beynon bought him out...

Doc looks at her.

                    CAROL
          What?

                    DOC
          If Beynon bought him out, and he talked
          then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting
          for us in El Paso.

Rudy knew about Laughlins.

                    CAROL
          You're full of ifs.

                    DOC
          I think you liked it with him.

I think he got to you.

                    CAROL
          Maybe. At least I got to him.
              (pause)
          Where do we go from here?

          El Paso.

INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT

A WATER PISTOL APPEARS AROUND THE CORNER   OF AN EMPTY
PASSENGER CHAIR. The seven year old brat   squeezes off several
plumes of water. The Thief is hit by the   gun's spray, water
runs slowly down his ear and the back of   his neck.

                     KID
          Bang!

THE BOY WATCHES THE IMMOBILE MAN. He fires again, once again
there is no reaction. The brat steps forward... smiling, he
pushes the thief's arm, pushes harder.

THE THIEF'S BODY SUDDENLY FALLS BACK ACROSS THE CHAIR. His
eyes roll upward... staring at the panther. His neck is
bruised, he pushes his hat back slowly.

                    THIEF
              (very hoarsely)
          Get me a doctor.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

CAROL SLEEPS ON HER STOMACH, her head resting across one arm.
Doc lies beside her, eyes open. He looks over at Carol a
moment, noting the long strands of hair that move
rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing. After
a moment Doc quietly stands, moves to the writing table and
stares at the black suitcase.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

He opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks
into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn
shade. Still holding the money, Doc looks back at Carol.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER HOLDS A SIMILAR MONEY PAD with his
handkerchief. The Panther is sitting with his mother on a
nearby seat. Still dressed in his panther suit, but no longer
a brat. His face reflects both fear and shock.

THE THIEF IS WITH THEM, BANDAGED AROUND THE THROAT

                    PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER

          It was a gift.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

CAROL COMES IN. SHE IS WEARING A NEW SUIT, SANDALS It looks

Doc looks at her outfit and opens his. They are too flashy.

          Thanks.
              (as Carol starts to speak)
          You look great, just great...

They could pick you up for soliciting in ten minutes.

          And that could be all for you., baby.

Carol suddenly angered slaps him.

Doc immediately delivers her a stinging blow.

Carol hits the wall then stands stunned as he quietly ties
his laces and pulls on his jacket. Doc stuffs the Colt .45
into the flapped outside pocket along with 2 clips. He turns
to the bed and picks up the suitcase.

Carol continues looking at Doc.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          Now you learn3 this time it could be the
          chair for both of us.

          How you doing over there, Harold? You
          sleep okay last night? Good. I'm glad to

CANNON (one of the Accountant's boys, whom we have not seen
before) ENTERS THE DARK NEARLY DESERTED LOBBY and approaches
the reception desk. The large room is populated by
overstuffed and threadbare furniture.

LAUGHLIN looks very much like Dub Taylor and speaks Spanish
just about as badly. He flashes a quick grin from behind the
counter as Cannon draws near. At the switchboard behind
Laughlin, CARMEN, maybe 35, sits next to the telephone jacks

          You Laughlin?

                    LAUGHLIN
              (Mr. Friendly)
          Yes, sir, and that's my wife and that's
          Junior.

Laughlin indicates a seventeen year old BELLBOY sleeping in
one of the overstuffed chairs.

                    CANNON
          Congratulations. I need a room.

                    LAUGHLIN
          No trouble. You came to the right place,
          one thing we got is a lot of rooms. What
          else can I do for you?

                                                             75.



INT. DOC AND CAROL'S CAR - DAY

AS IT MOTORS DOWN THE TEXAS HIGHWAY. The black suitcase is
propped up between Doc and Carol in the front seat. Doc,
seated on the passenger side, bangs the car radio with his
hand. The radio is obviously not working as he turns the
dials and pushes the buttons.

                    DOC
              (cajoling it)
          C'mon workl I
              (almost pleading)
          C'mon.

We hear garbled words for a moment, pleasing Doc... and then
the radio conks out again. This time Doc hits the radio hard.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (angrily to the radio)
          Give me the news!!

When it is clear that the radio won't work:

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          You can't trust anything these days.

                    CAROL
          I'll tell you something, Doc. One day
          you're going to have to trust somebody...

DOC SLAMS THE BRAKE, GRABS THE WHEEL as the car veers over to
the side of the road.

                     DOC
          I trust...
              (he opens the black suitcase)
          Want to see what I trust... In God we
          trust...
              (he pulls out a bill and points
               at it)
          The word's on every bill!!!

                    CAROL
              (slamming the suitcase closed)
          You keep it up and it won't matter how
          far we get away, because it's going to be
          all over between you and me. Do you
          understand that? There won't be anything
          left.

She starts the car up again, and continues driving, her
knuckles tightening around the steering wheel.

                                                          76.



INT. CLINTON'S FORD - ANGLES - DAY

AS IT LEISURELY MOVES ALONG THE ROADWAY BORDERED BY MILES OF
SAGEBRUSH. Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat
beside her husband... a scrunched up sack of food beside her.
She wipes her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper
bag, then turns to watch the passing scenery. Rudy sits in
the back, eating spareribs. He suddenly throws a just
finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the shoulder.

                    RUDY
          Have a bone, baby.

He throws another sparerib at Fran.

                    FRAN
              (shouts)
          Oh, Christ, you wrecked my blouse.

God damn it, Rudy, what did you do that for? Jesus.

                     RUDY
              (laughing)
          I'll tell you why I did it... it makes me
          feel good.

He laughs and again throws another bone at Fran. She suddenly
catches his mood and begins laughing herself ... tossing a
bone back at Rudy.

HAROLD CONTINUES DRIVING. His knuckles whiten around the
steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front
of him.

THE KITTEN IS SLEEPING WITHIN the cardboard box, oblivious to
Rudy and Fran's laughter. (That will be the day.)

EXT. SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY

THE CHEVY MOVES ALONG with the light mid-day traffic, passing
various roadside business establishments, then pulls up
before a radio/TV repair and sales shop.

INT. RADIO/TV STORE - DAY

ALL THE LATEST MODEL RADIOS are stacked on shelves around the
small room... a television display featuring several models
is in one corner of the shop. Another TV is playing near the
counter and the PROPRIETOR'S desk.

                    DOC
          A portable.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    PROPRIETOR
          Transistor?

                    DOC
          Yeah.

The Proprietor moves to a shelf.

THE SCREEN. As Doc's picture suddenly flashes onto the tube,
with appropriate dialogue.

DOC STARING AT THE TELEVISION, then he quickly reaches over
and snaps the set off.

THE PROPRIETOR BRINGS OUT SOME RADIOS, seemingly oblivious to
Doc's action.

                    PROPRIETOR
          15 to 55 dollars -- take your pick.

DOC TURNS, then looks at the corner of the small shop.

ALL THE TELEVISION SETS have Doc's picture on them.

DOC TURNS BACK TO THE PROPRIETOR -- the man is looking at him
not at the sets.

                    DOC
              (paying)
          Fifty --

Taking a set, he exits.

                    PROPRIETOR
          You have change.

But he doesn't answer.

INT. CAR - DAY

CAROL TURNS AS DOC STICKS HIS HEAD through the open door,
hands her the set.

                    DOC
          We got trouble. Let's take a walk.

DOC AND CAROL WALKING UP THE SIDEWALK OP THE SMALL TOWN. They
turn into a Sporting Goods Store. The Chevy is behind them, a
block away.

                                                             78.



INT. RADIO/TV STORE

THE PROPRIETOR LOOKS CAREFULLY OUT THE WINDOW AT THE empty
car, then turns and grabs his telephone.

INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE

CAROL REMAINS BY THE FRONT WINDOW, PRETENDING TO

EXAMINE some fishing equipment as she keeps her eye on the
street.

Doc moves to the counter at the rear of the store. An
ATTENDANT moves up to help Doc.

                    SALESMAN
              (with a smile)
          Can I help you?

                    DOC
          Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge
          pump with the twenty-inch barrel.

                    SALESMAN
          All right. Shells?

                    DOC
          Two boxes of double-ought buck.

                    SALESMAN
          Gonna knock down a wall?

                    DOC
              (big smile)
          Might try that.

The Salesman puts a form in front of Doc then goes to the gun
rack behind him, lifts off a short-barreled shotgun and
begins to wrap it.

                       SALESMAN
          Sign here.

CAROL, AT THE FRONT OP THE STORE, WATCHES THE STREET INTENTLY

EXT. THE STREET

THE RADIO-REPAIRMAN EXITS THE SHOP AS A POLICE CAR comes down
the street and makes a U-turn... stopping near the Chevy.
After a brief conversation the Radio-Repairman goes back
inside his store and the police car pulls forward, down the
street from the Chevy.

                                                             79.



INT. POLICE CAR

THE TWO COPS LOOK LIKE HOMER AND JETHRO. Both men stare hard
at the now staked-out Chevy.

CAROL -- WATCHING PROM THE WINDOW OP THE SPORTING GOODS STORE

AT THE COUNTER THE SALESMAN LAYS OUT THE GUN AND THE BOXES OF
SHELLS. As Doc empties the loose shells into his coat pocket:

CAROL TURNS, LOOKS AT DOC, THEIR EYES MEET. Doc reads her; he
knows that the police are in the street.

AT THE COUNTER THE SALESMAN PUTS A STRING AROUND THE BROWN
PAPER

                    SALESMAN
          Be one hundred and eighty-five thirty-
          two.

Doc quickly pays the man.

                    DOC
          Much obliged.

Doc turns as the Salesman drifts over to another Customer --
he approaches Carol at the store window.

                    CAROL
          Only one car.

                    DOC
          Let's do it.

Carol moves ahead of Doc,, exits the Sporting Goods Store and
starts up the sidewalk.

DOC WATCHES HER FOR A MOMENT, THEN HEADS FOR THE DOOR HIMSELF

EXT. SIDEWALK

CAROL WALKS ALONE BACK TOWARDS THE CAR.

INT. POLICE CAR

HOMER AND JETHRO CONTINUE STARING AT THE CHEW. Their car is
pointed towards the Radio Store, its back to the Sporting
Goods house.

DOC LEAVES THE SPORTING GOODS STORE, CROSSES THE STREET and
begins walking up the opposite sidewalk, back towards the
Chevy.

                                                             80.



CAROL PASSES THE POLICE CAR AND NEARS THE CHEVY

INT. POLICE CAR

THE TWO RURAL COPS MOVE INTO ACTION; their car pulls forward
and parks diagonally across the street, partially blocking
the roadway as xvell as nearly obstructing the Chevy.

CAROL STANDS FROZEN AS HOMER AND JETHRO HOP OUT OF THE POLICE
car, guns drawn.

DOC CROSSES THE STREET BEHIND THE COP CAR

HE LEVELS HIS big gun...

Doc FIRES the shotgun through the "brown wrapping paper point
blank into the squad car, caving in one side of the machine
and blasting the radiator into a steaming wreck.

Homer and Jethro hit the ground, paralyzed with fright as
their car EXPLODES behind them.

With three more BLASTS Doc blows most of the top off the
police car then calmly reloads.

                    DOC
          Slide those guns!

The two cops send their guns clattering across the pavement.

CAROL HAS INSTANTLY MOVED BACK INTO THE CHEVY, started the
engine and begun maneuvering it out onto the street. She
makes a U-turn, then pulls up near Doc.

DOC STEPS FORWARD, KICKS THE TWO PISTOLS BACK UNDER the
police car near the gas tank.

He walks to the back of the car.

Carol throws open the passenger door of the Chevy.

Doc SHOOTS the gas tank of the squad car, it instantly
ignites.

Walking calmly around the burning police car Doc then starts
to climb into the Chevy.

Carol REVS the engine.

Doc pauses a moment, looking back at the prone police
officers and the blazing automobile.



                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             81.
CONTINUED:


Carol guns the car forward -- Doc, unprepared for the Chevy's
sudden movement, falls flat on his face across the pavement.

CAROL THROWS THE CHEVY INTO REVERSE, AND ROARS back to pick
up Doc.

DOC, A LITTLE CHAGRINED, PICKS HIMSELF UP, GRABS his gun and
jumps into the Chevy. He slams the door closed, Carol again
tears forward -- tires peeling down the pavement.

HOMER AND JETHRO RAISE THEMSELVES. With very long faces they
study the burning remains of their once proud squad car.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE CHEVY SPEEDS OUT OF TOWN,, onto an open stretch of road.

INT. CHEVY

DOC JAMS ONE MORE SHELL INTO HIS PAPER-WRAPPED gun -- Carol
grips the wheel tightly concentrating on the road... the
Chevy continues to accelerate.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE CHEVY CROSSES THE ROAD'S BROKEN WHITE LINE and passes a
lumbering Greyhound bus.

DOC, STARING AT THE HIGHWAY BEHIND THEM; the bus fades off
into the horizon...

                       DOC
                 (finally)
             Here.

THE CHEVY PULLS OFF THE HIGHWAY, MOVES UP A DIRT road for
twenty yards then pulls into a cornfield of a well laid out
farm, smashing through the six foot high stalks. Well out of
sight, the Chevy slams to an abrupt halt.

DOC AND CAROL, RUNNING THROUGH THE CORNFIELD AND BACK UP THE
DIRT road toward the highway. Doc still carries his gun in
the brown wrapping paper. Carol labors with the suitcase as
she runs.

ON THE HIGHWAY DOC STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, waving
both arms overhead. The Greyhound bus comes to a lurching
halt, Doc and Carol scramble aboard.

INT. BUS

DOC BUYS TWO FARES FROM THE SCOWLING GREYHOUND DRIVER. The
bus again moves forward.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


DOC AND CAROL SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BUS, Doc hold- 4l4 ing
his camouflaged gun. They lean back on their padded seats as
the bus jostles along the road.

Suddenly... Two Police Cars pass the bus, SIRENS screaming,
lights turning...

Doc and Carol's eyes meet...

One more Black and White passes the bus and races on down the
road.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TEXAS TOWN - AFTERNOON 4L

DOC WEARS A SUNBEATEN LEATHER JACKET, READING A NEWSPAPER,
while leaning against a hot dog stand. One foot rests on the
suitcase. The Invicta has been re-wrapped in a laundry bag.
The paper is filled with news of the robbery and a mug shot
of Doc.

A GREY MERCURY PULLS UP NEAR THE DOGGIE DINER. Carol is
driving. Doc walks up to the window of the car.

INT. MERCURY

DOC LEANS IN THROUGH THE WINDOW.

                    DOC
          Where are you going?

                      CAROL
          El Paso.

Doc opens the door and moves into the driver's seat.

                      DOC
          How much?

                    CAROL
          Twenty eight hundred.

As she looks at him, he smiles:

                    DOC
          Are you hungry?

                      CAROL
          Not now.

He drives off.

          I'll tell you when.

EXT. HIGHWAY - TEXAS - MIDNIGHT 4L

A FRONTAGE ROAD BORDERING THE EDGE OF A GOOD-SIZED TOWN.
Carol now driving,, pulls off the highway and into an "Oasis"
drive-in restaurant.

THE MERCURY COMES TO A STOP WITHIN A ROW OF CARS FACING the
indoor portion of the restaurant.

DOC AND CAROL - INSIDE THEIR AUTOMOBILE AS THE CAR HOP - a
skinny girl, wearing a brown jacket and slacks, approaches
the car carrying two menus. She arrives with a smile. Doc
leans forward, looking past Carol at the waitress, he lifts
his hand, not accepting the bill of fare.

                    DOC
          That's okay, honey. Two cheeseburgers;
          two coffees and a milkshake.

                    GIRL
          How about fries?

                    DOC
              (big smile)
          Why not?

The Car Hop walks back across the raised cement sidewalk
towards the kitchen area...

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

HAROLD IS TIED TO A CHAIR, RUDY IS LYING ON THE BED, half-
clothed, eating chicken, drinking a beer, while Fran slowly
strips down to bra and panties.

INT. MERCURY AT THE DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT

DOC AND CAROL WATCH AS THE CAR HOP PREPARES to bolt the
serving tray onto the car-door window.

                    GIRL
          Could you roll it up part way?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    CAROL
          Sure thing.

The girl clamps the tray to the window. The Car Hop narrows
her features, looking at Doc and Carol then smiles and turns
and heads back toward the kitchen.

DOC REACHES UP AND CASUALLY ADJUSTS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR

THE MIRROR HAS BEEN TURNED TO REVEAL THE HIGHWAY AND THE
ENTRANCE TO THE DRIVE-IN'S PARKING LOT

CAROL BEGINS TO EAT, she looks casually at the mirror.

DOC SLOWLY EATS HIS CHEESEBURGER, TAKES A SIP OF MILKSHAKE

CAROL REACHES FOR HER COFFEE, spills it and then reaches for
the light switch knob on the dashboard.

THE MERCURY'S HEADLIGHTS BLINK ON

THE CAR HOP AT THE PICK-UP STAND, notes the lights 429 then
turns her head the opposite direction, pretending not to see.

DOC WATCHES THE WAITRESS TURN AWAY

THE CAR HOP STARES AT THE CEMENT PAVEMENT. Within the kitchen
behind her the cooks all look toward the parking lot... their
faces expectant.

DOC WATCHING THE WAITRESS

                    DOC
          She made us.

Carol looks into the rear view mirror. Across the wide lot a
police car appears, cutting in off the highway.

Doc goes into the back seat, Carol kicks the engine over,
jams the stick into gear. All this is accomplished while
staring into the rear view mirror.

DOC LIFTS THE LAUNDRY BAG-COVERED SHOTGUN onto his lap.

THE POLICE CAR cruises slowly along the line of autos...

INT. POLICE CAR

TWO OFFICERS SCAN THE PARKING LOT. THE PASSENGER COP CRADLES

CONTINUED:


THE SQUAD CAR PULLS TO A STOP FIFTEEN FEET behind the
Mercury, seemingly blocking the way.

                    DOC
          Now.

CAROL STANDS ON THE ACCELERATOR. THE MERCURY GOES screaming
forward, as Doc shoots out the back window. Then, as the
terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front
windshield. The Mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the
empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll
across the concrete. The car slams back down through a vacant
space on the opposite side, and moves around in a semicircle
across the asphalt, heading for the highway exit.

DOC SMASHES OUT THE REAR WINDOW with the butt of his shotgun.

THE BLACK AND WHITE NOW IN REVERSE, ZOOMING BACK, trying to
get between the Mercury and the highway.

CAROL BRINGING THE CAR AROUND, SHE CAN SEE THE SQUAD CAR
streaking backward. She pulls the wheel to the right and
brings her car across the front of the still stopping Police
Car.

THE OFFICERS TRY TO BRING THEIR GUNS INTO PLAY AS THE Mercury
streaks in front of them.

DOC FIRES THE SHOTGUN TWICE

THE POLICE CAR EXPLODES. THE HOOD IS LIFTED OFF THE CAR. Both
Officers jump out of the vehicle, pouring shots after the
retreating Mercury.

CAROL - SCREAMING AS THE FRONT AND BACK WINDSHIELDS SHATTER
around her.

THE MERCURY, BADLY RIDDLED, PULLS OUT ONTO THE HIGHWAY

ANOTHER SQUAD CAR COMES SPEEDING UP in the opposite
direction. The Driver hits the brakes, the tires smoke along
the street as the Black and White SCREAMS to a stop.

CAROL PULLS THE MERCURY BY THE SQUAD CAR

DOC FIRES ANOTHER TWO BURSTS...

THE POLICE CAR - THE FRONT AND BACK FENDERS ARE HIT; the
wheels disintegrate - the impact of the shells rocks the
Black and White upward.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


THE SECOND PASSENGER COP, FIRING A .38 OUT HIS BACK WINDOW at
the Mercury as it streaks down the road. Three holes open up
on the trunk of the auto.

DOC CAN SEE BOTH OFFICERS JUMP OUT OF THE SECOND Black and
White through the rear window. Carol makes a quick turn off
the highway.

THE MERCURY ROARS DOWN THE DARK STREET INTO THE CITY'S
COMMERCIAL SECTION, suddenly slow, makes another sharp turn -
this time through a red light.

DOWN A SMALLER STREET FILLED WITH SHOPS - CAROL ROUNDS THE
CORNER, whips up to the curb - Doc and Carol jump out of the
car. She carries the suitcase, he hangs onto his big gun.

DOC AND CAROL, MOVING DOWN A DESERTED SIDEWALK; the SOUND of
sirens. They round a corner, then quickly move into an alley.

THE ALLEY IS NARROW, DESERTED. DOC AND CAROL pull back into
an alcove as a prowl car goes SCREAMING down the street and
off into the night. They continue down the alley.

THE OPPOSITE ENTRANCE TO THE ALLEY IS BLOCKED BY a large
metal garbage container, and the DRIVER empties two cans of
garbage into it. Then he starts across the narrow street
beyond in order to grab several others.

DOC LOOKS BEHIND HIM, THEN GRABS CAROL'S ARM. They run for
the container. Doc tosses the suitcase into the container,
jumps in, reaches back, pulls Carol in beside him. SIRENS
again sound close by.

AFTER A MOMENT, A LARGE GARBAGE TRUCK PULLS UP, lifts the
container with hooks and dumps the garbage and Doc and Carol
into the truck.

A SERIES OP ANGLES AS A CRUSHER BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARDS THEM
INSIDE THE TRUCK. Doc and Carol start to panic, but they have
room enough.

WITHIN THE TRUCK DOC WIGGLES HIS .45 out of his jacket and
into his hand. He, Carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly
amongst the garbage. A moment after Doc frees his gun, a load
of garbage descends on their shelter, partially obscuring
them.

THE TRUCK PULLS OUT

DOC AND CAROL SWEATING... BREATHING HARD. Again the SOUND of
sirens... the truck lurches forward.

prowling squad cars.

EXT. STREETS - SERIES OF ANGLES - SUNRISE

THE GARBAGE MAN DRIVING THE TRUCK, MAKING STOPS, throwing in
more refuse. The truck continues along.

DOC AND CAROL - THEIR FACES COVERED WITH PERSPIRATION and
flies... buried within their enclosure under the moist
garbage.

A GARBAGE DUMP - MORNING

THE TRUCK GROWLS ALONG THE RUTTED PATHWAY surrounded by acres
of open trash. Areas within the dump reveal the slow,
smouldering fires...

THE TRUCK BACKS UP TO A HUGE CRATER HALF-FILLED WITH REFUSE

THE DRIVER REVS THE ENGINE, PULLS THE BED LIFT GEAR

THE TRUCK BED RISES AND TILTS FORWARD, as the load of trash
tumbles down the face of the crater.

DOC AND CAROL SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF FILTH, and stumbling
forward they climb into a large cardboard box.

THE DRIVER GETS OUT OF THE CAB, checks to see that the
garbage is gone from the truck bed. On his way back to the

tire. With his newly-found prize, the Driver re-enters the
truck and drives away.

THE BOX LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER AMONGST the broken
bottles, melon rinds, flashlight batteries, tin cans, used
tires.

DOC SAWS AT A CORNER OF THE CARDBOARD BOX with his penknife.
The matted paper gives away, allowing them more room within
the box.

                    DOC
          Okay?

                    CAROL
          I think so... I don't know.

Doc puts his hand to her face, wiping away a thin trace of
blood from a scratch.

                    DOC
          It's not deep.

Carol tries to smile for the first time in quite a while.

                       CAROL
          No scars?

                       DOC
          No scars.

Doc looks across the garbage through the open end of the
crate.

THE HEAT AND THE FLIES HAVE BECOME UNBEARABLE. Carol begins
to scratch her leg.

                     DOC (CONT'D)
          Don't scratch it, just rub, you'll get an
          infection.

Carol ignores him, she is in bad shape.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Do what I tell you, it's not a game.

                    CAROL
          It's all a game, don't bother me.

Doc stares at the garbage around them.

                    DOC
          We better stick here till tonight.

                       CAROL
              (down)
          Yeah.

Doc smiles, trying to get her to smile again.

                    DOC
          We're going to make it.

                    CAROL
              (further down)
          Sure...

Carol rubs one hand along her now terribly soiled, tweed
suit.

She looks away from Doc. Doc stares at her mussed hair and
tear-stained cheeks.

                    DOC
          I want to say something.

               (quiet defeat)
           I don't want to hear it.

                     DOC
               (softly)
           Listen to me. It's hard enough.

Carol turns back, faces Doc. Their eyes find one another.

               (continuing)
           Look, what you said yesterday... I guess
           that was right. It isn't worth anything
           if we don't make it together.

                     CAROL
           I don't think we can any more... If we
           ever get out of here, maybe I should take
           off...

                     DOC
           We got this far.

                     CAROL
           We've come a lot of miles. But we're not
           close to anything.

                     DOC
           I guess you're right.

A pause.

                     CAROL
           I always thought jails make people hard.
           Not you. You're just not tough enough to
           forget about Beynon. I chose you, not
           him.

                     DOC
           Either we pick it up or else we leave it
           right here. We got to go one way or
           another.

                     CAROL
               (setting the condition)
           No more about Beynon.

          I don't see how.

A long moment.

                    CAROL
              (finally talcing Doc's arm)
          Okay.

                    DOC

          You and me.

                    CAROL
          Can we make it?

                    DOC
          We get to Mexico, we can have a life.

                    CAROL
          That's all I want... It's the only thing
          I have ever wanted.

As she pulls herself against him:

                    DOC
          I'm going to try and get it for you.

They pull each other closer, tightly holding one another.

RUDY IS LYING IN BED READING A NEWSPAPER PILLED WITH DOC AND
CAROL. The fact that they have been seen in the North. He
smiles.

Fran is in the bed beside him asleep naked under the sheets.

                    RUDY
              (calling softly)
          Harold, you've had ten minutes, get out
          of there.

No answer. Rudy gets up and crosses to the bathroom.

                                                             91.

INT. FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR LAUGHLIN HOTEL - MORNING

LAUGHLIN LEADS RUDY AND FRAN down the dark-walled hallway,
stopping before room number 4l8. Laughlin turns the key in
the lock, opens the door.

                    LAUGHLIN
          It's hard to figure. There's something
          about the composition of the track at
          Pimlico... You can't go by the clock, any
          speed horse, take a second off any other
          track in the country.

INT. ROOM 418

                                                          92.



AS THE GROUP ENTERS.

                    LAUGHLIN
              (continuing)
          ... but a speed horse is the only thing
          that consistently holds form. They got to
          let 'em run, dumb God damn trainers try
          to rate 'em, just breaks their heart.

Rudy kicks the door shut with a slam, grabs Laughlin's
shoulder, spins him around, hits him full in the stomach. As
Laughlin begins to fall Rudy catches him, wallops him again
in the mid-section, then throws him back into a ratty
armchair. Rudy instantly pulls out his .44 and shoves it hard
against Laughlin's mouth.

                    RUDY
          Okay, sweetpea, you get two choices. Live
          or die.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
          Do what I tell you, you not only get to
          live, but maybe you'll pick up some
          money.

                    LAUGHLIN
              (still breathless)
          Just tell me.

                    RUDY
          First things first. Main thing, you work
          for me, otherwise I get you. If I don't,
          six months from now one of my friends
          will.

              (handing him a paper)
          It's all there, departure, arrival -
          everything except the $500.

Doc pays him, looks closely into his eyes. Jimmy hasn't
changed and it's set.

          yours help her with the suitcase.

                    LAUGHLIN
          He took the day off.

                    DOC
          Then you do it.

                    LAUGHLIN
          Can't leave the desk.

Doc gives Laughlin a half-pissed look, then crosses to the
elevator and pulls the cage door open.

LAUGHLIN WATCHES THE RICKETY, self-service elevator move
upward. He reaches for the desk phone.

INT. ROOM 4L8 - DAY

FRAN, WEARING ONLY A BATHROBE, is doing her nails while
watching an old movie on the black and white tube, seated on
the bed. The phone begins to RING.

Fran looks over to Rudy from her overstuffed armchair.

          Okay, Grunt, pick it up.

ELEVATOR DOORS - THIRD FLOOR

CAROL EMERGES THROUGH THE SLIDING DOOR AND TURNS DOWN THE
CORRIDOR. She walks slowly, carrying the heavy suitcase.
Reaching the door to room 31oj Carol knocks rapidly three
times, waits, then raps out two sets of two knocks. The door
swings open and Doc stands within the archway. She enters.
Doc shuts the door and slips his arms around Carol, revealing
his .45 automatic in one hand.

INT. RUDY'S HOTEL ROOM

RUDY IS SPINNING THE CHAMBER on his .44 then shoves it into
his coat pocket. Fran is getting dressed in the middle of the
room, her breasts and thighs ripple outward from the confines
of the bra and girdle.

THE CALICO KITTEN SLEEPS PEACEFULLY IN ITS cardboard box.

                                                              95.



INT. BATHROOM 3L8

CAROL IS IN THE SHOWER, STEAM HANGS IN THE AIR as she
vigorously soaps her body, cleansing herself of the residue
left from their cross-country flight.

DOC IN THE MAIN ROOM IS STANDING AT THE LARGE windows facing
across to the building next to Laughlins. The fire escape is
one story beneath him. Doc crosses, throws the suitcase on
the bed, undoes the straps and snaps, lifts the lid open. He
stares at the huge amount of money for a moment, then digs
into the suitcase, reaching down to the bottom. He withdraws
his hand, holding four visas.. He puts two of them on the
bureau drawer top... the other two he begins to tear into
sections and places them into a large ashtray. He touches a
match to the scraps.

THE FLAMES CURL AROUND RUDY'S PHOTOGRAPH in the ashtray.

Doc whips his pen knife out of his pocket, crosses the room
to the locked door of an adjoining hotel room. He begins
forcing the lock.

          I can't do that, ma'am. You have to pay
          now so I can pay back the boy that went
          out and got the food...

DOC working on the door; his .45 shoved into the waistband of
his pants.

CAROL thinking hard...

                    CAROL
          All right. You'll have to hold on a
          minute, my husband's in the shower...

DOC breaks the lock and opens the door -- he quickly crosses
the dark apartment, moves to the front door, slips out his
automatic, then gingerly cracks the door. His eyes tighten in
amazement as he sees:


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             99.
CONTINUED:


RUDY STANDING SLIGHTLY BEHIND FRAN, his .44 held tightly up
to the door jamb, ready for instantaneous use. Rudy and Fran
are 15 feet down the hallway from Doc's slightly opened door.
They both have their backs turned to him in three-quarter
fashion.

DOC BAREFOOTED., BARE-CHESTED; he decides on a course of
action. The door swings quietly open.

WITHIN THE HALLWAY, DOC CLOSES THE DISTANCE between himself
and Rudy in two swift strides, Rudy turns,, swinging his gun,
too late, as Doc's .45 crashes against his head. Rudy drops.
Fran screams. Rudy looks at Doc, still smiling, eyes glazed.

He falls abruptly. Doc stands over the fallen body. Fran
continues to scream. Doc finally turns away from Rudy,
looking now at the screaming woman. He flattens her with a
left hook to the jaw. Fran drops to the floor as if she had
been shot. Suddenly everything in the corridor is silent.

RUDY'S HEAD IS BLOODIED. He lies without movement.

DOC NOW SLAMS AT THE DOOR OF 318

                    DOC
          Open it up, it's me.

Carol swings the door open. Doc bursts back into the room,
grabs his shirt, begins to button it.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Come on, come on.

                    CAROL
          Who was it?

                    DOC
          Just get your clothes on...

THE FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

AS DOC AND CAROL COME BACK OUT OF 318 they step over the
fallen bodies and start toward the waiting elevator.

Carol stops as she recognizes Rudy. Doc pulls her along,
forcing her to keep moving. Carol again carries the brown
suitcase, Doc holds the shotgun. They go down the back (or
front) stairs.

                                                           100.



INT. LOBBY

THE ACCOUNTANT STANDS AT ONE CORNER OP THE RECEPTION COUNTER
IN THE LOBBY OF LAUGHLINS. Within an alcove behind and to one
side of the desk (the area serving as an office) Cully, Swain
and Hayhoe have stretched Laughlin across the pine desk. The
Accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the
hotel3 acting as lookout.

CULLY INSIDE THE ALCOVE LIFTS A SNAPPED OFF LEG of the heavy
chair to use as a club. The thug turns back to the desk where
Swain and Hayhoe have Laughlin pinioned.

                       CULLY
             Just tell us the room number.

LAUGHLIN LOOKS BACK AT CULLY. He is very frightened but says
nothing.

CULLY SLAMS THE WOODEN CLUB DOWN ON LAUGHLIN KNEECAP

                       CULLY
             Now you want to tell me?

                       LAUGHLIN
             McCoy's in 318., the other guy's in 420.

                       CULLY
             Sure about that?

He again whacks Laughlin's knee.

INT. LOBBY STAIRS

DOC AND CAROL EMERGE,, MOVING QUICKLY FOR THE. main entrance.
They get five steps before simultaneously seeing the
Accountant.

                       CAROL
             Doc !

Doc and Carol freeze for an instant.

The Accountant snaps his fingers twice.

Cully lowers his club, looks to the Accountant, as do Swain
and Hayhoe. The Accountant smiles, staring at Doc and Carol.

                       ACCOUNTANT
                 (calmly to his men)
             Out here.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           101.
CONTINUED:


CULLY, SWAIN AND HAYHOE APPEAR FROM THE ALCOVE BEHIND the
Accountant. They look over his shoulder toward the rear of
the hotel, their eyes finding Doc and Carol.

INT. WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY

DOC HAS ONE HAND IN HIS OUTSIDE COAT POCKET, WRAPPED

around the .45. Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in
front of herself, almost like a shield. The distance between
Doc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut
off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk.
Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden
staircase.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Just have her set it down.

Doc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture
revealing that his palm is empty.

                    DOC
          You want it? Come and take it.

THE ACCOUNTANT NOW PLANKED BY THE THREE MEN

                    ACCOUNTANT
              (quietly)
          Get him.

As the three men reach for their guns.

DOC MOVES MUCH PASTER. HE DUCKS TO   THE RIGHT, levels the
disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement. The
reception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast
and he is hit painfully. The other   three men duck away from
the sudden burst of fire power.

DOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRS

HAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another
shot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor
at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees. Cannon,
Cully, Swain and Max open fire as they dive for cover. They
miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring.

ON THE WINDING STAIRWAY DOC AND CAROL FLEE UPWARD She
struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun
to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with
his right.

                                                         102.



WITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCES

Cully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull
the door shut. Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max
start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol.
All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their
hands.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the
first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of
Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard.

HAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly
up and fires.

DOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as
Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister
supports.

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow
indicator pass "Two."

DOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two
shots back down the stairwell.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly
Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the
other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder.

SWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver
straight up... empties it.

DOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls
Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell
with a huge roar.

THE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's
blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to
continue moving upward. Cannon following.

THE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT "THREE"

CULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The
Accountant remains within the elevator.

SWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD

CAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs
ahead of Doc by three steps. They pass the second landing,
keep moving upwards towards the third.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           103.
CONTINUED:


Doc's focus of attention is downward. He knows that he and
Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware
of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces.

RUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE
DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly
wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs
violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up
his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's
room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door.

CAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five
steps behind.

DOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT

SWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR

Cully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He
moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the
distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within
the elevator.

Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The
SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses
a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As
Carol screams:

Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane
of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45
in his right.

CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds
fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed
by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of
their mark.

DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE

THE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the
riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The
plaster flies away revealing further damage. The cables are
smashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward.

THE EMERGENCY CABLE, INSIDE THE SHAFT

THE MECHANISM TRANSFERS OVER, line catching within the pulley
housing. The line snaps taut - halting the speeding car.

WITHIN THE LOBBY

                                                           104.



AS THE ELEVATOR SLAMS TO A WRENCHING STOP FIVE FEET

ABOVE the floor level. The Accountant bounces from the floor
of the car to the ceiling, then back to the floor.

Laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain. He
sees the suspended car through the iron grill door.

The Accountant lies completely still on the floor of the
elevator. His head and neck twisted at an oblique angle.

DOC ON THE THIRD FLOOR LANDING

HE JAMS SEVERAL SHELLS INTO HIS RIOT GUN WHILE HOLDING his
.45 ready for an appearance by Swain. Reloading completed, he
stands, with Carol. He again begins to move upward.

SWAIN FIRES FROM THE STAIRWELL

DOC STOPS, SETS BOTH THE RIOT GUN AND THE .45 on 562 the
banister... He waits... on the winding staircase below him
there is a dark movement.

DOC FIRES BOTH GUNS

THE STAIRWELL AROUND SWAIN DISINTEGRATES. The thug is
obliterated by the firepower.

DOC CANNOT SEE THE EFFECT OF HIS SHOTS. He again resumes his
flight upward.

INT. DOC'S BATHROOM

RUDY HOLDS HIS BLOODY HEAD IN THE SINK BOWL, DUMBLY splashing
water over himself. Carol's underwear is still present.
Rudy's pistol lies on the soap tray.

THE LANDING AS DOC AND CAROL COME POUNDING INTO VIEW. No
further avenues open, they turn down the corridor. Doc grabs
Carol and pushes her into the room, past Fran; he kicks the
door shut.

INT. THE ROOM

DOC GRABS THE SUITCASE, RUNS TO THE WINDOW, TEARS off the
shade, lifts the frame, looks. The drop is too far. He grabs
Carol and runs into the hallway.

INT. CORRIDOR

THEY RUN DOWN TWO DOORS AND BREAK IN. Over the door is the
sign "Fire Escape."

                                                         105.



INT. FIRE ESCAPE ROOM

DOC HELPS CAROL OUT ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE. He aids her with
his left hand, the riot gun now clutched tightly in his
right. He motions, she hands him the suitcase and follows.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

THEY DESCEND THE FIRE ESCAPE. They reach the end. The fire
escape stays rigid.

Doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps. He turns and
with the suitcase crosses to the end. Throws the bag and the
shotgun across the 6 foot gap to the retaining wall,
preparing to jump.

RUDY COMES OUT OF THE ROOM ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE holding his
.44. He looks down at Doc, then slowly raises his gun. Carol
screams.

DOC JUMPS. RUDY FIRES. DOC IS HIT IN THE SIDE (flesh wound).
In the air he spins and lands. Rudy fires again and again as
he runs down the fire escape. Doc rolls, picks up the shotgun
and fires.

RUDY'S TIME HAS COME. THE JUMBO CHARGES MASH HIM BACK against
the wall and off the fire escape.

CAROL RUNS ALMOST STAGGERING AND GETS READY TO JUMP the six
feet.

THE FIRE ESCAPE. BEGINS TO SINK. CAROL LOOKS AT DOC mutely,
as she sinks beneath the retaining wall.

                    DOC
              (his hand out)
          Jump!

And she does. He catches her and pulls her up.

They look at one another for a long moment, then he stands
and helps her to her feet, and leaving the shotgun behind
they walk into the alley.

RUDY LIES DEAD BEHIND THEM

IN A PARKING LOT AT THE END OF THE ALLEY, SLIM, a tough,
grizzly Western is about to pull out. Doc opens the back door
and Carol gets in. Doc opens the front door as Slim turns and
looks at him.

He lets out a yell and guns across the lot over the four foot
drop to the sidewalk and into and off a car and into the
street.

                    SLIM (CONT'D)
              (grinning)

          Why not?

The car pulls forward as the light blinks to green.

EXT. STREET

AS THE CAR PASSES AN INTERSECTION, SEVERAL POLICE cars can be
seen arriving at the front of Laughlins.

The car continues moving up the street, then makes a right
onto a larger boulevard.

Doc half turns to Carol.

                      DOC
          You okay?

                    CAROL

EXT. CASETA BRIDGE CROSSING - DAY

THE AMERICAN OFFICIALS SIMPLY WAVE THE CAR BY.

At the white line a Mexican CUSTOMS OFFICER emerges from the

          One thing though... how do I explain this

                    CAROL
          Tell her you robbed a bank...

The car pulls forward. Slim waves goodbye, then turns and
begins walking back down the highway.

BACK INSIDE THE CAR, DOC ACCELERATES AWAY

                    CAROL
          Are we going to make it?

                    DOC
          Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it

           Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.

                     CAROL
           I guess we are.

After a moment:

                     DOC
           Why don't you try the news?

Carol snaps on the radioj the voice of a Mexican announcer is
heard.

                     CAROL
           No more news, from now on we're just
           going to listen to music.

She spins the dial. Mariachi music comes on.

EXT. MAIN HIGHWAY

AS THEY HIT THE MAIN HIGHWAY, DOC PULLS OFF AND STOPS.

                       CAROL
           What now?

                       DOC
           We walk.

THEY ARE WALKING ALONG THE HIGHWAY, THE EDSEL IS now a dot in
the background. Another dot appears, grows bigger, as it gets
closer it is a bus. Very Mexican but very Greyhound in
appearance.

Doc and Carol turn, Doc flags it down.

It pulls to a stop, they board. The bus pulls out.

INT. BUS

DOC PAYS AND THEN FOLLOWS CAROL TO A SEAT.

They sit. Mexico rolls by outside the window.

They look at each other and smile.

FADE IN:

EXT.  FOREST - DAY

Germania.  The far reaches of the Roman Empire.

Winter 180 A.D.

Incongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a
beautiful tenor voice.  Singing.  A boy's voice.

CREDITS as we hear the haunting song float through dense
forests.  We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing
through the forest.  On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER
is herding along three sickly looking cows.  His two SONS
are with him.  His youngest son sits on one of the cows
and sings a soft, plaintive song.

They become aware of another sound behind them on the road
-- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  The
Father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the
road.  They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture
of subjugated peoples throughout history.

A wagon train rumbles past them.  Three ornate wagons
followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed
PRAETORIAN GUARDS.

The young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans.
His eyes burn with hatred.

INT.  WAGON - DAY

Mist momentarily obscures a man's face.  Frozen breath.
The man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome.  He is
swathed in fur, only his face exposed.  He is COMMODUS.

He glances up.

					COMMODUS
		Do you think he's really dying?

The woman across from him returns his gaze evenly.  She is
slightly older, beautiful and patrician.  A formidable
woman.

She is LUCILLA.

					LUCILLA
		He's been dying for ten years.

					COMMODUS
		I think he's really dying this time.

A beat.  Their breath turns instantly to mist.

					COMMODUS
		He has to be bled every night now.

					LUCILLA
		How do you know that?

					COMMODUS
		I've been so informed.

She arches an eyebrow.

					COMMODUS
		If he weren't really dying he
		wouldn't have sent for us.

					LUCILLA
			(a smile)
		Maybe he just misses us.

					COMMODUS
		And the Senators.  He wouldn't have
		summoned them if --

					LUCILLA
		Peace, Commodus.  After two weeks on
		the road your incessant scheming is
		hurting my head.

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		The first thing I shall do is honor
		him with games worthy of his
		majesty.

					LUCILLA
		The first thing I shall do is have a
		hot bath.

The wagon rumbles to a halt.  Voices are heard outside.

Commodus leaps out...

EXT.  WAGON - OUTPOST - DAY

Three Roman SOLDIERS guard an outpost, a watchtower, on
the roadside.

					COMMODUS
		Why have we stopped?

					PRAETORIAN GUARD MEMBER
		We're here, sir.

					COMMODUS
			(to Soldier #1)
		Where is my father?

					SOLDIER #1
		He's at the front, sir.

					COMMODUS
		Is the battle won?

					SOLDIER #1
		Don't know, sir.  They've been gone
		for eight days.

Commodus tosses off his furs -- beneath them he wears a
beautiful set of Lorica Segmentata -- the traditional
formed armor of Rome.  He moves to a horse as:

					COMMODUS
			(to Soldier #1)
		My sister wants a bath, take her to
		the camp.
			(to Soldier #2)
		Take me to my father.

He leaps onto the horse and canters back to the Praetorian
Guard unit.

Soldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them.  Commodus
rides off with most of the Praetorian Guard unit.

Lucilla peeks her head from the wagon.  She glances at the
remaining soldiers.  Distinctly unpromising.

					LUCILLA
			(dry)
		Civilization at last.  Gods preserve
		us.

EXT.  HILL - TWILIGHT

The mighty catapults dwarf the humans.  Soldiers from the
elite Felix Regiment -- a legion of the Roman Army -- haul
the monstrous machines up a hill.

The commanding General of the Felix Regiment, MAXIMUS,
walks between two of the catapults.  He is a striking and
intense man in his 30's.  Like all the soldiers who
surround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted.

He trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants, TITUS and
QUINTUS.

					TITUS
		You would do as well to read the
		mind of a rhinoceros.

					QUINTUS
		These barbarians would rather drown
		in blood than yield an inch.  If I
		didn't hate them so much I would
		admire them.

They have reached the top of the hill.  Stunning martial
preparations are underway.  The catapults join ten others.
Archers are taking up position.  Brutal "Scorpions" --
devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being
loaded.  Soldiers are also loading the catapults with
enormous "Greek fire pots" -- large, round terra cotta
pots.

Maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop.
Below them they can see a German encampment.

					TITUS
		They simply will not surrender.

A beat as Maximus gazes down at the German position.

					MAXIMUS
			(quietly)
		A people should know when they are
		conquered.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		At the first signal release the
		catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to
		cut off the retreat.

					QUINTUS
		General, I don't recommend that.
		Our cavalry might be caught in the
		flames.

					MAXIMUS
		I hope not, because I'm going to be
		leading them.

A beat as he gazes down at the enemy.

					MAXIMUS
		Why don't they know they're already
		dead?

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

Maximus and Titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two
hundred Felix Regiment warriors surrounds them.  Steam
flares from their horses' nostrils.  They wait in a thick
stand of trees -- the German position can be seen across a
muddy plain.

A large wolf -- "The Wolf of Rome" -- waits at Maximus'
side.

Maximus nods to an archer.  The archer lights the tip of
an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky.

EXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT

Quintus waits.  The catapults are loaded and waiting.  So
too the Scorpions.  So too the 200 archers of the Felix
Regiment.

He sees the flaming arrow flying up from below.

					QUINTUS
		Now!

The mighty catapults are released.  The Greek fire pots
arc dramatically through the air.  A moment later soldiers
release the Scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through
the sky.  The archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming
arrows.

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

The screaming is almost immediate.

Maximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down
into the German encampment.

EXT.  GERMAN CAMP - TWILIGHT

The fire pots shatter -- pitch splashes everywhere --
seconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and
ignite the pitch -- FLAME EXPLODES -- it is a hellish,
napalm-like vision -- the conflagration illuminating the
twilight.

The deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through
the German camp --

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

Maximus watches the German camp.

					MAXIMUS
			(to his men)
		Hold steady... steady...

He can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment
continuing -- fire pots and Scorpion bolts and flaming
arrows -- panic in the German encampment.

					MAXIMUS
		Steady...

He sees the Germans begin fleeing across the plain.  He
quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns
to his men:

					MAXIMUS
		Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome!

He spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the
plain...

EXT.  PLAIN - BATTLEGROUND - TWILIGHT

Maximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge
-- Titus at his side -- the Felix Regiment screams out
fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain
toward the Germans --

Fire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere
around them --

The cavalry SLAMS into the Germans at full gallop --

It is carnage.

The Felix Regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short
swords -- slicing a path of sheer destruction through the
Germans -- but the Germans fight with equal brutality --
and the Germans also fight with the desperation of a
hopeless last chance -- they pull and spear Roman soldiers
off horses whenever they can --

Maximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert
efficiency -- a spear stabs through the neck of his horse
and it immediately collapses forward --

Maximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the
muddy ground -- he jumps up and is in the midst of the
battle --

The flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a
ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle -- the
flames silhouetting the fighting --

On the ground, Maximus proves his absolute worth as a
warrior -- he hacks and dodges -- ghastly images of true
ancient warfare -- Maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire
as he fights for his life --

He finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage --
Germans are surrounding him from all sides -- as he fights
he looks for an advantage -- for his soldiers -- for
anything -- he is doomed --

Then -- an almost mystical image -- Maximus' wolf leaps
through a wall of flame --

"The Wolf of Rome" savages several Germans around Maximus
-- giving him the help he needed.

The wolf and his master fight, side-by-side.

EXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT

We see an old man's face, staring down at the battle.  The
face is weather-beaten, ailing.  The roaring flames from
the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes.

MARCUS AURELIUS, the Emperor of Rome, is on a horse.  A
metal brace extends from the back of his saddle.  He is
strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps.

He watches as the Felix Regiment below concludes the
battle.  The cheering of the Regiment can be heard as the
final, isolated pockets of Germans are cut down.

Behind Marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood
red.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - SUNSET

Maximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of
the carnage.  The Wolf of Rome is at his side.  Dead and
dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere.  Roman
surgeons are attending to the wounded.

Marcus walks to him, embraces him warmly.

					MAXIMUS
		Caesar.

					MARCUS
		Maximus, you prove your valor again.
		Let us hope for the final time here.

					MAXIMUS
		I don't think there's anyone left to
		fight.

					MARCUS
		There are always people left to
		fight...

Marcus takes Maximus' arm and they walk through the masses
of bodies.  Maximus holds Marcus' arm firmly, quietly
supporting him as they walk.

					MARCUS
		But this night, at least, Germania
		is at last defeated... What will you
		do now, my friend?

					MAXIMUS
		Should Caesar permit, I'll go home.
		I've been away too long.  I've
		forgotten my wife's face and I
		barely know my son.

Suddenly, a tethered GERMAN PRISONER they are passing
calls out to them:

					GERMAN PRISONER
		THIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING, CONQUEROR!

Maximus and Marcus stop.  A soldier moves quickly to
silence the German Prisoner.

					MARCUS
			(to Soldier)
		Stop...
			(to Prisoner)
		... You speak our language?

					GERMAN PRISONER
		You have been in my homeland for
		twelve years.  Of course I speak
		your language.  So did my son, who
		you murdered.  So did my daughter,
		who you raped.

					MAXIMUS
			(to Marcus)
		Come, Caesar...

					MARCUS
		No.  Let him speak...
			(to Prisoner)
		... I am Rome, what would you say to
		me?

					GERMAN PRISONER
			(points to sunset)
		You are that sun, Rome, and your
		time is over... You can slit a
		thousand throats here, and you can
		put a thousand babies to the sword,
		but it will always be our home.

					MARCUS
		Now it is Rome.

					GERMAN PRISONER
		It will never be Rome.  Not as long
		as one German breathes.

The soldier moves to kill the insolent Prisoner.

					MARCUS
		No... Release him.  Give him safe
		passage.  Let him go to his family.

The soldier leads the German Prisoner away.

Maximus and Marcus continue walking in silence for a beat.
Then:

					MARCUS
		Tell me again, Maximus, why are we
		here?

					MAXIMUS
		For the glory of the empire, sire.

					MARCUS
			(quietly)
		Yes.  I remember.

They continue walking through the mountains of bodies...

EXT.  ROAD - SUNSET

Maximus and Marcus are now walking along a road through
the dense forest.  Slaves follow behind them, leading
their horses.

Both sides of the road are filled with the men of the
Felix Regiment.  As Maximus and Marcus pass, the battered
and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising
their swords, paying silent homage.

					MAXIMUS
		They honor you, Caesar.

					MARCUS
		I don't think they're standing for
		me, Maximus.  They honor you.

Just then Commodus canters into view with his Praetorian
Guard escort.  He watches the army honor Maximus with rank
envy as he nears.

He rides up to Maximus and Marcus.

					COMMODUS
		Have I missed it?

He leaps from his horse.

					COMMODUS
		Have I missed the battle?

					MARCUS
		You've missed the war.  We're done
		here.

Commodus embraces him, awkward.

					COMMODUS
		Father.  Congratulations.  I shall
		sacrifice a thousand doves to honor
		your triumph.

					MARCUS
		Spare the doves and honor Maximus,
		he won the battle.

Commodus embraces Maximus, even more awkward.

					COMMODUS
		General, Rome salutes you and I
		embrace you as a brother.

					MAXIMUS
		Highness.

They walk, Maximus still supporting Marcus, as:

					COMMODUS
		Your Spaniards seem invincible.  May
		the Gods favor the Felix Regiment
		now and always...
			(to his father)
		Here, Father, take my arm.

					MARCUS
			(ignores this)
		Where's your sister?

					COMMODUS
		She's at the camp.  She had no
		desire to see the gore of the
		battlefield.

					MARCUS
			(smiles)
		Lucilla would eat every corpse here
		if it brought her one step closer to
		the throne.

Maximus laughs.

					MAXIMUS
			(smiles)
		Caesar, you do the lady injustice.

					MARCUS
		It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't
		recognize his own off-spring...
			(he suddenly stops,
			not feeling well)
		I think... I should ride now.

Maximus waves for Marcus' horse.  It is brought up.
Several soldiers carefully help the old man into the
saddle.  He is then tethered to the brace on his saddle.
It is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the
Emperor of Rome.

When at last he is strapped in, he looks to Maximus.

					MARCUS
		So much for the glory of Rome.

Without a word to his son, Marcus nods and the horse is
slowly lead away.

Commodus and Maximus watch him go.

					COMMODUS
			(neutral)
		He's dying.

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Poor old man.

					MAXIMUS
			(terse)
		If you'll excuse me, Highness.

He turns and stalks away.

EXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT

We see the Roman encampment, a sea of tents.  Hundreds of
campfires burn before the tents.

INT.  HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT

Maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of
the dead and dying.  Roman surgeons are working feverishly
to save lives.  Limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps
quickly cauterized with hot irons.  Leeches and bronze
cups are employed for blood-letting to balance "humours."

Anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent.  Wine amphoras
are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward
the patients.  Mostly, though, they just hold down the
writhing patients.

Maximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort
here and there.  All the wounded are delighted to see him.

He goes to an older soldier, GALLUS, who has one wooden
hand.  His other hand is bandaged.

					MAXIMUS
		What, Gallus, losing your other
		hand?

					GALLUS
		Aye, General, they're going to make
		a bronze one for it.  Long fingers
		this time.

					MAXIMUS
		And the women of your village will
		crave your touch even more.

					GALLUS
		Ah, then you know the women of my
		village.

Maximus smiles and moves on.

He stops at a young soldier, VALERIUS, whose head has been
shaved.  A hole has been bored into his skull to relieve
the pressure on his brain.  The young soldier is dying.

					MAXIMUS
		What's your name, son?

					VALERIUS
		Valerius, General.

					MAXIMUS
		The name suits you.

					VALERIUS
		Why am I dying?

A beat.  Maximus sits by his cot.  He takes Valerius'
hand.

					MAXIMUS
		You're dying because you love Rome,
		as I do.

					VALERIUS
		I've never been to Rome.

					MAXIMUS
		Neither have I.  Rome for us lives
		here...
			(he touches his
			heart)
		... it's a thing inside us that came
		from our ancestors and that we give
		to our children.

					VALERIUS
		It must be glorious, Rome.  I've
		only seen pictures.  Is it a
		glorious place?

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		Yes, it's a glorious place.

					VALERIUS
		It must be.

He smiles.  And he is dead.

Maximus sits for a moment.  He gently closes Valerius'
eyes.  And Maximus finds that he is weeping.

He is not ashamed of the tears.

INT.  MESS TENT - NIGHT

An immediate swirl of noise.  The grand mess tent is
crowded with soldiers.  They are still filthy with caked-
on mud and blood.  Wounds are bandaged and tankards are
raised in celebration of the victory.

Marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors.
Currently two Senators, FALCO and GAIUS, are bowing before
him.

					FALCO
		Hail, Marcus Aurelius.

					MARCUS
		Stand up, Senators.  That unfamiliar
		posture doesn't suit you.

					GAIUS
		We live in supplication to your
		glory.

					MARCUS
		All the while conspiring with that
		fat man in Rome.  How is the old
		monster?

					GAIUS
		Senator Gracchus is hale, sire.

					MARCUS
		Still damning me to the four winds?

					GAIUS
		Still eager for your triumphant
		return to Rome, Caesar.

					MARCUS
		I would have silenced him decades
		ago -- but I just like him too much.

Meanwhile, Maximus stands with his lieutenants, Titus and
Quintus.  A wound on Maximus' arm has been bound.

					MAXIMUS
			(to Titus)
		If you want to stay on, I support
		you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the
		Emperor to appoint you in my place.

					TITUS
		It won't be the Felix Regiment
		without you.

					MAXIMUS
		I'll return after a season at home.
		Maybe two.

					QUINTUS
		That means after three or four more
		babies.

					TITUS
		And you'll be too fat from Vibia's
		cooking to get on your horse by
		then.

					MAXIMUS
		Should the Gods so bless me.  I
		would be thankful.

Commodus perambulates up to them.

					COMMODUS
		Hail, warriors.  My congratulations.

					TITUS AND QUINTUS
			(bowing)
		Highness.

					COMMODUS
			(to Maximus)
		My old friend, my father tells me
		you're returning to Spain?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					COMMODUS
		A pity.  I'll need men like you in
		my army...

An awkward glance between the soldiers.  This sort of talk
is offensively premature.

					COMMODUS
		There are larger division that might
		appeal to you.  Even the Praetorian
		Guard.  You've never been to Rome.
		Imagine arriving as head of the
		Praetorians!  They have really
		splendid uniforms.

					MAXIMUS
			(cold)
		I'm going home.

Senators Gaius and Falco join them.

					GAIUS
			(to Maximus)
		... And why not apply for entry to
		the Senate?

					FALCO
		A war hero with a handsome face and
		a strong heart could go far.

					COMMODUS
		General Maximus, may I present
		Senators Gaius and Falco.  Beware of
		this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed
		potion in your ear and you'll wake
		up one day and all you'll say is
		"Republic, Republic, Republic..."

Laughter.

					FALCO
		Have you never considered Rome?

					MAXIMUS
		No.

					COMMODUS
		You've had my ear since we were
		children.  You could be a valuable
		ally in the Senate.

					GAIUS
		Are you a believer in Republicanism?

					COMMODUS
			(laughs)
		There -- I warned you.

					MAXIMUS
		I'm a soldier, not a politician.

Meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden
slit in the tent wall.  The eye is particularly drawn to
Maximus.

					GAIUS
		If your heart lies with the people,
		I would back you for the Senate.
		I'm sure Gracchus would as well.

					COMMODUS
		Not a word about that sodomite
		bastard.

					GAIUS
			(smiles to Maximus)
		The august Senator Gracchus has been
		rather a gadfly on the flesh of the
		imperial family.

					FALCO
		He's a damned provocateur.

					GAIUS
		He lives under the antiquated
		assumption that the Senate should
		represent the people with vigor.

					COMMODUS
		I won't tolerate it.  His incessant
		criticism exhausts me.  The man can
		speak for five hours without taking
		a breath.

					GAIUS
		He serves Rome best when he serves
		it with honesty.

					COMMODUS
			(sharply)
		Enough... Maximus, I would like to
		inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn.
		Please arrange it.

					MAXIMUS
		I can't do that.

					COMMODUS
		Excuse me?

					MAXIMUS
		My men have been fighting for five
		solid days.  They're too busy dying
		to go on dress parade.

A beat.  Commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke.
He very quickly gets control.

					COMMODUS
			(smiles)
		Of course, how foolish of me.  Some
		other time...

He notes his father being helped out of the tent by
several body slaves.

					COMMODUS
		Caesar retires early tonight.

INT.  TENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Marcus is helped out of the mess tent into a tent corridor
attached.

He sees his daughter Lucilla in the corridor, spying in
through the slit in the tent wall.  He watches her,
smiles.

					MARCUS
		If only you had been born a man...

She turns to him.  He leaves his body slaves and goes to
her.

					LUCILLA
		Father.

					MARCUS
		What a Caesar you would have made.

					LUCILLA
		You're right.

					MARCUS
		I think you would have been strong.
		I wonder if you would have been
		just?

					LUCILLA
		I would have been what you taught me
		to be.

A beat.  They stare at each other.  He finally smiles.

					MARCUS
		Well, pretend to be my loving
		daughter tonight and walk with me to
		my chamber.

She smiles and takes his arm.  They slowly walk down the
tent corridor as:

					MARCUS
		This is a pleasant fiction, isn't
		it?

They disappear into darkness.

EXT.  TENT CITY - DAWN

Maximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets
the Rome camp.  He stops to observe an unusual sight.

Commodus is stripped almost naked, his chiseled body
covered in a fine sheen of sweat.  He and his six
CENTURION BODY GUARDS are going through their daily
ritual.  They defy the sub-zero temperatures and hack at
small trees with swords.

It is an eerie, zen-like workout.  Commodus' intense
concentration is unnerving.

Maximus watches for a moment then moves on.  He approaches
a large network of tents.  He enters.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - DAY

Maximus enters Marcus' darkened tent.  Flickering braziers
provide the only light in the enormous Imperial tent.
Heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the
timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind.

Marcus stands before a map of the Roman Empire.

					MAXIMUS
			(bows)
		Caesar.

Marcus holds out a scroll.

					MARCUS
		Read this.

					MAXIMUS
		I never acquired the art, sir.

					MARCUS
		Of course.  No matter.  In this
		letter I denote my intention to
		nominate you to stand for the
		Emperorship after my death.

A stunned pause.  Maximus stares at him.

					MARCUS
		My son is not a moral man.  You have
		known this since you were young.  He
		cannot rule.

					MAXIMUS
		Caesar, I am honored but --

					MARCUS
		For twenty years I have been
		spilling blood.  For twenty years I
		have written philosophy and
		ruminated and conquered.  Since I
		became Caesar I have only had four
		years without war.  Four years of
		peace in twenty.  So perhaps I can
		be... forgiven.

A long beat.

					MARCUS
		While I have been fighting, Rome has
		grown mad and corpulent and
		diseased.  I did this.  And now I
		shall make it right.

					MAXIMUS
		Sire, you brought the light of the
		Gods to barbarian darkness.  You
		brought civilization and justice to
		the farthest --

					MARCUS
			(fierce)
		I have brought the sword -- nothing
		more!  Rome is far away and we
		shouldn't be here.  What matter is
		it to the Gods if we subdue one more
		tribe of Parthians or Gauls?  What
		matter is it to Rome if a thousand
		more barbarians bend to our lash?

A beat.

Marcus sits.  He doesn't look at Maximus.

A pause.

					MARCUS
		Winter, Maximus.  It's winter now...

A beat.

					MARCUS
		There was a dream that was Rome.  I
		can only whisper of it now.
		Anything more than a whisper and the
		dream vanishes.  It's so... fragile.
		The true glory of Rome is in a very
		fragile idea.  Imagine a place
		devoted to the rights of the
		citizen.  Where every free man has a
		voice.  That was the dream... And I
		fear it will not survive the winter.

He holds out a hand to Maximus.  Maximus takes his hand,
deeply moved, kneeling.

					MARCUS
		Let's just whisper here, you and I.

					MAXIMUS
		Yes, Caesar.

					MARCUS
		If the dream is ever to live again
		the people must have a true voice.
		The voice I took from them.  That
		all the Caesars took from them, bit
		by bit, conquest by conquest.  And
		now that I am dying I am going to
		give them that voice again.

					MAXIMUS
		You're not dying.

					MARCUS
		I am, Maximus.  It's strange... I
		find as I near the end I think
		little of the waning moments around
		me... instead I think much of the
		past... and of the future.  How will
		the world speak my name in years to
		come?  Will I be known as the
		philosopher?  The warrior?  The
		tyrant?  Or will there be a more
		golden sounding to my name?  Will I
		be the Emperor who gave Rome back
		her freedom?

A beat.

					MARCUS
		Before I die I will give the people
		this final gift.  I will give them
		the Senate reborn.  The voice of the
		people empowered again, as it was
		always meant to be.  It is my design
		that they will elect the next
		Emperor.  And I would put forward
		your name with my backing.

					MAXIMUS
		Caesar, you do me honor -- but your
		son has pride of place for
		succession.

					MARCUS
		You are the son I should have had...
		Although I fear in my deepest heart
		that if you had truly been my son my
		blood would have polluted you as it
		did Commodus.  We're a cursed
		bloodline.  We have lived so long in
		power and depravity that we no
		longer remember a life without it.
		We can no longer even imagine a life
		without it.

A beat.

					MARCUS
		Look at me, son.

Maximus looks at him.

					MARCUS
		Son... I know that one grove of your
		vineyard is worth more to you than
		all the treasures of Rome.  I know
		one loving word from your wife is
		worth more than the accolades of an
		Empire.  But... a fond old man, who
		loves you more than he can say, begs
		you to at least think about what he
		has said tonight.

					MAXIMUS
		I shall, Caesar.

A beat.

					MARCUS
		I'll keep this letter to myself.  I
		hope that with the sunrise you will
		agree.  And embrace me as a father.

Maximus nods and rises.  He begins to go.  Stops.

					MAXIMUS
		You have always been my father.

He goes.

INT.  TENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Maximus emerges from Marcus' tent into a long tent
corridor, deep in thought.

					LUCILLA'S VOICE
		He always favored you...

He turns.  Lucilla is waiting.  She glides to him.

					LUCILLA
		Even over his son.

					MAXIMUS
			(turning away)
		That's not true.

					LUCILLA
		Maximus, stop...
			(he stops)
		Let me see your face.

He turns to her.

					LUCILLA
		You've been crying.

					MAXIMUS
		I lost too many men.

					LUCILLA
		What does my father intend?

He turns and walks.  She walks with him.

					MAXIMUS
		I don't know.

					LUCILLA
		You're lying.  I could tell when you
		were lying even when we were
		children.  You hate it.

					MAXIMUS
		I never acquired your comfort with
		it.

					LUCILLA
		True.  But then you never had to.
		Maximus, stop...
			(he stops again)
		... Is it really so terrible seeing
		me again?

					MAXIMUS
		No.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired from the
		battle.

					LUCILLA
		And you are hurt to see my father
		dying.

A beat.

					LUCILLA
		He will announce Commodus'
		succession.  That's why he summoned
		us.  Will you serve my brother as
		you served his father?

					MAXIMUS
		I will always serve the ideals of
		Rome.

A beat.

					LUCILLA
		Do you know I still remember you in
		my prayers...?  Oh yes, I pray...
		Ever since that day you saved me
		from drowning off Capri.  Do you
		remember?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					LUCILLA
		Commodus was so angry that a mere
		peasant -- a Spaniard no less --
		touched the royal person, do you
		remember his anger?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					LUCILLA
		Mark this, Maximus:  that is the man
		who will be Emperor.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		May I be permitted to go, Highness?

She smiles sadly.

					LUCILLA
		There was a time when you didn't
		call me "Highness."

					MAXIMUS
		And there was a time when you were
		just a little girl drowning in the
		sea.  All that was a different life.

					LUCILLA
			(quietly)
		Very different... I wonder if it was
		better?

					MAXIMUS
		It was more honest.

A moment between them.  We sense there is much to be said,
much that could be said.

Finally:

					MAXIMUS
		I thank you for your prayers.

He goes.  She watches him walk away.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent.  He faces
six small figures that represent his dead ancestors.

					MAXIMUS
		Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you
		for your guidance.  Bring me your
		solace and your wisdom.  Blessed
		Mother, come to me in my dreams with
		the Gods' desire for my future.
		Blessed Father, watch over my wife
		and my son with a ready sword.  Keep
		them safe until my return.  Whisper
		to them in their sleep that I live
		only to hold them again and all else
		is dust and air.  Ancestors, true
		bloodline, I honor you and will try
		to live with the dignity you have
		taught me.

He looks at his "ancestors" for a moment and then blows
out the candles around them.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT

Commodus' eyes are red with weeping.  He sits, head down,
at the foot of Marcus' bed and speaks to his father.

					COMMODUS
			(quietly)
		I search the faces of the Gods for
		ways to please you... to make you
		proud... and I can never do it.  One
		kind word -- one full hug where you
		pressed me to your chest and held me
		tight -- would have been like the
		sun on my heart for a thousand
		years... What is it in me you hate
		so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My
		hands are your hands.  All I have
		ever wanted was to live up to you.
		Caesar.  Father.

He stands.  We see that he is holding the scroll denoting
Marcus' intention to nominate Maximus as Emperor to the
Senate.  Commodus cannot control his tears.

					COMMODUS
		Why does Maximus deserve what I
		could never have? -- Why do you love
		his eyes over mine? -- I would
		butcher the whole world -- if you
		would only love me...

Commodus weeps.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Quintus is waking Maximus --

					QUINTUS
		General -- Maximus --

					MAXIMUS
		Quintus -- ?

					QUINTUS
		The Emperor needs you.  It's urgent.

Maximus leaps up and throws on a cloak, strides out with
Quintus...

EXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT

Dead of night.  Maximus and Quintus stride quickly through
the sleeping camp toward Marcus' tent.

					MAXIMUS
		What is it?  Is he ill?

					QUINTUS
		I don't know...

They continue on toward Marcus' tent.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus and Quintus stride into the tent -- Maximus slams
to a halt.  Stunned.

Commodus stands before him.  Lucilla stands in a corner of
the tent, head down.

And Marcus Aurelius dead, lying on his bed.

Maximus stares at Marcus.

					COMMODUS
		Lament with me, brother, our great
		father is dead.  I want --

Maximus, not even hearing, steps past him to Marcus.

He stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before
Marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead.  A ritual
farewell.

A moment of silent mourning and then Maximus stands.  He
turns very, very slowly to Commodus.

					COMMODUS
		General, the Gods' have taken the
		great man and left me alone.  My
		first desire as Emperor is that you
		take my hand in friendship.  I need
		you at my side, Maximus, at this
		moment above all others.  Stand with
		me.

Maximus glares at him:

					MAXIMUS
		How did he die?

Commodus does not respond.

					MAXIMUS
		How did he die?

					COMMODUS
		The surgeons say it was his breath
		that gave out.

Maximus glances to Lucilla, she avoids his eyes.

					COMMODUS
		Take my hand, Maximus.  I only offer
		it once.

A beat.

Maximus turns back to Marcus.

					MAXIMUS
		How will the world speak your name
		now, old man?

Without a glance to Commodus, he stalks out.

A silent beat.  Then Commodus nods to Quintus.  Quintus
goes.

Lucilla looks at Commodus for a long moment, her face an
enigmatic tornado of complex emotions.

Then:

					LUCILLA
		Hail, Caesar.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus is kneeling before his ancestors, head down, his
fists clenched, praying.

Quintus and four Praetorian ASSASSINS suddenly burst in --
the assassins move immediately to bind Maximus -- swords
at his throat --

					MAXIMUS
		What -- ?!

					QUINTUS
			(ashamed)
		Please don't fight, Maximus --

					MAXIMUS
		Quintus --

Quintus goes to Maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and
slowly removes his seal of office.

					QUINTUS
		I'm sorry, General, Caesar has
		spoken.

They pull Maximus out --

EXT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - TENT CITY - NIGHT

Five horses are waiting.

					MAXIMUS
		Quintus, what -- ?

					QUINTUS
			(anguish)
		I have no choice --

They are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty
Praetorians who gallop past.  Maximus knows immediately
what this means.

					MAXIMUS
			(suddenly)
		My family?!

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		What about my family, Quintus?

					QUINTUS
			(quietly)
		They will greet you in the
		afterlife.

Maximus lunges at him -- the Praetorians subdue him --
slamming him with a sword hilt -- knocking him
unconscious.

					QUINTUS
			(quietly, to
			assassins)
		Take him as far as the sunrise and
		then kill him.

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

The four Praetorian assassins lead Maximus along a road.
He sits slumped in his saddle, drained.

					ASSASSIN #1
		All right, this is far enough.

The three other assassins climb from their horses.
Assassin #2 pushes Maximus from his horse.  He falls to
the ground hard.

					ASSASSIN #1
		You two take him down there where no
		one will find him.

					ASSASSIN #3
		Come on, General...

Assassin #3 and Assassin #4 drag Maximus down a densely
forested hill along the road.  Maximus' hands are still
bound in front of him.  He seems totally lacking in any
resistance.

EXT.  FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN

Maximus eyes the two assassins as they troop down the
hill away from the road, he notes their sparkling armor.
The armor of men who have never seen real battle.

					MAXIMUS
		Have you ever done this before?

					ASSASSIN #3
		What?

					MAXIMUS
		Killed a man with a sword?

					ASSASSIN #3
		Not like this, exactly... this is
		good, you can stop.

They stop.  They are far down the hill, out of sight of
the road.

					MAXIMUS
		It can be very messy -- you could
		get blood all over your armor.  You
		don't want to hack me up now.  You
		want one clean stroke.

					ASSASSIN #3
		Would you kneel, General?

Maximus kneels, his whole body secretly coiling.  Assassin
#3 stands over him as:

					MAXIMUS
		One good stroke -- you do know
		where, don't you?

					ASSASSIN #4
		Be quiet.

					MAXIMUS
		If you miss the spot there'll be
		blood everywhere.  Quite a spray.

					ASSASSINS #3
		All right, where?

					MAXIMUS
		Here -- you don't want to hit the
		vein on the neck --

Maximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of
his neck.

					MAXIMUS
		Put the point of your sword here...
		you want one, good blow right at
		this spot --

Assassin #3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the
spot on Maximus' neck.

A grave mistake.

Maximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his
hands and yanks it from Assassin #3 -- EXPLODING up -- his
hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air
and catches it -- swings the sword with brutal efficiency
-- decapitating both assassins --

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

On the road above, the other two Assassins are on their
horses, waiting.

They hear a quick yelp from below.  And then nothing.

Assassin #1 nods for Assassin #2 to check on the
execution.  Assassin #2 canters off the road and down the
hill...

EXT.  FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN

Assassin #2 canters down the hillside.

He senses movement behind him -- spins around, drawing his
sword -- too late --

Maximus throws a sword -- it flashes through the air --
and into Assassin #2.

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

Assassin #1 waits on his horse.  He hears the commotion
below -- spins his horse around just as Maximus bursts to
the road.  He stands with a sword.

Assassin #1 spurs his horse and gallops toward Maximus at
full speed -- Maximus crouches and prepares --

Assassin #1 and Maximus swirl together for an instant --
both slashing brutally --

Assassin #1 continues to gallop past Maximus.  He stops.
He looks down.  A wound in his stomach.  He falls off his
horse.  Dead.

Maximus has also been wounded -- a deep gash on his side.
He fights the pain as he moves toward the horses...

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAY

Maximus is galloping through the forest at lightning
speed, leading four horses behind him.  The gash in his
side bleeding.

EXT.  TENT CITY - DAY

A gloomy day.  Emperor Commodus stands before the
assembled Felix Regiment.

The soldiers are already uneasy.  They note Quintus
standing by Commodus, wearing Maximus' seal of office.
Where is Maximus?

					COMMODUS
		Even as the Gods curse this dark day
		with clouds, so too does the sun
		begin to shine forth on a promised
		tomorrow.  Even as we mourn the
		passing of our father, so too do we
		celebrate the coming of a bright,
		new age for Rome.  At my side,
		brothers, you shall pull fresh
		glories from the heavens.  At my
		side, brothers, you shall know the
		adoration of the Gods.  Doubly-dark
		is this day because my friend, your
		noble commander Maximus Meridas, has
		been called to Rome to deal with
		urgent matters of state...

Titus glances quickly to Gallus, whose hand is bandaged
from surgery.  They know this cannot be true.

					COMMODUS
		Until his promised return I
		appointed Quintus Domitian to serve
		in his stead.  I salute you,
		Legionnaires!

					QUINTUS
			(raising his sword)
		Hail, Caesar!

The Felix Regiment responds, many unsure.

					FELIX REGIMENT
		Hail, Caesar!

Commodus strides off and the Felix Regiment slowly
disbands, muttering to one another in confusion.

Titus and Gallus go to Quintus.

					TITUS
		Quintus, what is -- ?

					QUINTUS
			(firmly)
		Don't speak of it.  Never speak of
		it.

He stalks off.  Titus and Gallus, concerned, watch him
follow after Commodus.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - DAY

Lucilla stands in Maximus' tent.  She looks around.  She
gently touches his Lorica Segmentata.  Her fingertips move
along the contours of his armor.  She tries to retain her
neutral demeanor.

She notes his "ancestors" on the small alter.

EXT.  HILLSIDE - NIGHT

Maximus continues to gallop, he is on a different horse.
He leads only two horses now.

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAY

Maximus' home in Spain is beautiful beyond measure.

We see verdant farmlands and vineyards and a spacious
house nestled amid gently rolling hills.

Maximus' eight-year-old SON is in a paddock playing with
his pony.  He stops, sees something.  Over a hill, he can
just glimpse a battle flag, approaching.

He screams with joy and runs toward the flag as he calls:

					MAXIMUS' SON
		MOTHER!  MOTHER!  FATHER'S HOME!

Maximus' WIFE emerges from the house, drying her hands on
a cloth and smiles.

Maximus' Son races toward the flag.  He can just see the
soldiers beginning to appear over the hill.  Not a Roman
Legion at all.  Twenty Praetorians canter over the hill.

Maximus' Son stops, confused.

EXT.  OLIVE GROVE - DAY

Maximus is galloping up a hill, leading only one horse
now.  The horse he is on is exhausted, spent, foam coats
its neck.  It can't make it.

The horse collapses and Maximus falls.  He immediately
leaps onto the remaining horse and continues riding up the
hill.

EXT.  HILLS AROUND VINEYARD - SUNSET

Maximus is racing over the countryside, galloping in a
frenzy.  His wound is bleeding profusely, coating the side
of his horse.

He rears the horse to a stop for a moment.  Over a hill he
can see thick black smoke rising.  He spurs the horse and
gallops over the hill...

EXT.  VINEYARD - SUNSET

And his worst nightmares are realized.

His home and his vineyards have been destroyed.  The earth
has been scorched and his house is still smoldering.  He
rides up to the house and practically falls off the horse.

He pulls himself up and walks past the smoldering debris
of his house, fearing what he knows he will find.

He sees the bodies of servants scattered about in the
ruins.  He sees a Praetorian battle flag.

He continues on, his wound bleeding more with every
tortured step.  He finally stops.  He stares up.

His wife and his son have been crucified and burnt.  They
are nothing more than grotesquely twisted, charred shapes.

Maximus instantly collapses to his knees -- he howls out
his torment in a heartrending keen of despair as he coats
his face in the ashes of his dead world.  He sinks into
unconsciousness, praying for death.

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAY

An unusual jingling sound is heard.  Maximus appears to be
dead, his gaping wound beginning to fester.

The source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the
feet of Bedouin brigands, with delicate anklets, shuffling
around him.  A hand touches his sandals.  Rich sandals.
Another touches his tunic.  Good cloth.

Suddenly Maximus groans.  The hands stop.  He's alive.  A
bit of quick language in an unknown tongue.

Then the hands grab Maximus and drag him away.

EXT.  SLAVE WAGON TRAIN - DAY

Maximus' eyes slowly open --

Inches away from his face -- a lion roars --

Maximus lurches back.

He looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon.
Three other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape.
Exotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the
wagons:  lions, panthers, zebras, a giraffe.  A dozen
slaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and
other cargo.  Bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal
babel of foreign tongues.

And someone is looking at him.  JUBA, a striking African,
is gazing at him impassively as he chews something.  Juba
is also chained.

					MAXIMUS
			(weakly)
		Am I in Hades?

					JUBA
		Yes.

Juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and
moves to Maximus.

					JUBA
		For your wound...

Maximus stares at him.

					JUBA
			(nods)
		For your wound.

Maximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side.

Juba carefully places his poultice over the wound --
Maximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into
the wound gently as:

					JUBA
		If you die in the wagons they feed
		you to the lions... The lions are
		worth more than we are.  I think we
		are worth more than the zebras
		though.  So they don't feed us to
		them.

Maximus stares at him.  Juba looks down at him with the
barest hint of a smile.

					JUBA
		I'm not sure about the giraffe.

EXT.  SLAVE MARKET - DAY

The heat of Morocco is unlike anything Maximus has ever
known.  Shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand.

The provincial market is bustling like the proverbial
anthill.  Slave traders and dealers and merchants move
around, all talking very quickly and very emphatically.

Maximus, Juba and a number of other slaves are on display,
poked and prodded and fondled.  Their BEDOUIN SLAVE TRADER
sings out their praises to any passers.

The crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival
of PROXIMO.  Proximo is a large man of immense appetites.
He has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate.  Two
slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with
switches.

					SLAVE TRADER
		Proximo, my old friend, see what I
		have for you today -- !

Proximo SLAMS a fist into the Slave Trader's face.  The
Slave Trader sails back.

					PROXIMO
		Those giraffes you sold me won't
		mate!  All they do is run around not
		mating!  YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH
		GIRAFFES!!

The Slave Trader pulls himself up, hugely obsequious.

					SLAVE TRADER
		I will make it up to you, Master.
		It's bargain day for you!  Look,
		look, look -- I have two lions and a
		panther -- hear how they roar for
		you!  "Bring me home, Proximo!"

Proximo examines the animals.

					PROXIMO
		How much for the lot?

					SLAVE TRADER
		For you -- 8,000 sesterces.

					PROXIMO
		For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want
		to see their balls first.  And you
		throw in those two slaves.

					SLAVE TRADER
			(moves to Maximus)
		What about this one?  Look at the
		arms!

Proximo moves to Maximus.  The Slave Trader forces open
Maximus' mouth.

					PROXIMO
		Good teeth --

Proximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body.

					PROXIMO
		Where did you get those scars?   

Maximus doesn't respond.

					PROXIMO
		Are you a soldier?

Maximus doesn't respond.

					PROXIMO
		Do you speak? --
			(he roars back to a
			slave)
		KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME!
			(back to Maximus)
		He's dying.

					SLAVE TRADER
		1,000 sesterces.

					PROXIMO
		My ass...
			(moves to Juba)
		You throw in this one and we'll make
		it 7,000 sesterces for the whole
		lot.

					SLAVE TRADER
		I have to eat, Master!  He's my
		finest, I couldn't let him go as
		part of the lot for less than 9,000
		total...
			(back to Maximus)
		I tell you this one is prime.  He's
		a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my
		men before he could be subdued!

Proximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars
again.  The scars, and something he senses in Maximus'
eyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it.

					PROXIMO
			(to trader)
		All right, let's see.

The Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and
bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains.
Maximus has no idea what's going on.

In the center of the market place, a veritable GIANT of a
man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand.  He
is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot
chain shackled to his ankle.  A think metal helmet is
riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair
emerging.  His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in
the helmet.

The Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and
shoves him toward the Giant.  The Giant stands.  He towers
over Maximus.

The Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with
remarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block
the blow -- it sends him flying to the ground.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils
-- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant moves in again -- he slams him a few more times
-- Maximus makes no attempt to protect himself -- he
falls.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant is about to attack again --

					PROXIMO
			(to Slave Trader)
		That's enough.

					SLAVE TRADER
		STOP!  STOP!

His colleagues race into the ring and haul the Giant away
from Maximus.  The Giant quietly sits back on his stool.

Proximo studies Maximus for a moment and then glances to
the Slave Trader.

					PROXIMO
		I'll give you 500 sesterces.

					SLAVE TRADER
		No -- no -- 1,000!

					PROXIMO
			(laughs)
		Come, don't quibble with your old
		friend.  I'll take the lions, the
		panther, the Numidian and this one
		for 7,000.  And I'll buy you the
		best whore in the town for two
		nights.  She's an enormous mountain
		of flesh who craves a stern hand.

					SLAVE TRADER
		How could I say no to my old friend
		Proximo?

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - DAY

Maximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten
other slaves, including a very scared and reedy SCRIBE.
Other wagons are filled with exotic animals, including
several lions.

The wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken
through an imposing set of gates to...

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - DAY

An open compound in Proximo's school.  On one side of the
compound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of
every description -- including Proximo's two hapless
giraffes.

Proximo's house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased
exotic animals into cages as Maximus and the new slaves
are unloaded.  Heavily armed guards supervise everything.

But Proximo's slaves are having a bit of a problem with
one of the new lions -- it growls and resists them.

Without the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the
lion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a
cage.

					PROXIMO
		COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!

He kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the
cage.

Proximo's provincial school resembles nothing so much as a
seedy prison.  The fading grandeur of the decaying
battlements and the sweeping North African architecture
only slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place.

And if Maximus had any doubts as to Proximo's profession
-- all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound.

Twenty GLADIATORS are working out in the compound --
hacking at practice dummies and sparring.  The many
heavily armed guards oversee everything.  The gladiators
stop working out as they see the new slaves enter.  They
eye their potential new opponents warily.

One huge, glowering gladiator -- VIBIUS -- watches with
particular interest.  His eye is quickly drawn to the most
obvious athlete:  Juba.

The new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound
and house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of
water on them, cleaning them.

Meanwhile, Proximo shrugs off his cloak.  A slave brings
him wine as he give his "welcoming speech" to the new
slaves:

					PROXIMO
		Slaves.  I am Proximo, trainer of
		gladiators.  You live and die at my
		pleasure.  Fight well and you will
		live.  Fight poorly and you will
		die.  It is better to live.

Slaves now toss thick handfuls of powdered lime on the new
slaves -- they cough and clench their eyes shut, the lime
coats and stings their wet bodies.

					PROXIMO
		Here you will be trained in the art
		of combat.  Here you will be given
		the tools to survive.  Please my
		patrons in the arena and all the
		gifts of the world will be showered
		upon you.  Imagine riches beyond
		your paltry dreams of riches!
		Imagine fame beyond your rude
		understanding of the word!  All this
		can belong to the select few who
		prove their worth in the arena.

Slaves throw more water on the new slaves -- washing off
the lime.

					PROXIMO
		If... on the other hand... you
		disappoint me... you will be
		dismembered and fed to my jackals
		limb by limb.

He gazes evenly at his new acquisitions.

					PROXIMO
		And my jackals are always hungry.

He strides off and the guards shove the new gladiators
toward their cells.

INT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - MAXIMUS' CELL - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell.  The cell
door faces the open compound.  Across the compound they
can see the much more comfortable cells of the "star"
gladiators such as Vibius.

They both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall.
Juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon.
Maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not
touched them.

					JUBA
		Have you killed a man before?

Maximus does not respond.

					JUBA
		You should eat.  You'll need your
		strength tomorrow.

Maximus does not respond.

					JUBA
		I've never killed a man.  But I
		think you have.

Maximus does not respond.

					JUBA
		I almost killed once.  The Romans
		destroyed my village.  I was with a
		hunting party and when we
		returned... I would have killed
		every Roman in the world.

A long beat.

					JUBA
		If you don't eat you will die.

Maximus does not respond.

A beat.

					JUBA
		In the village I come from there was
		a man once.  He went fishing one day
		and his boat was attacked by
		crocodiles.  One of them ate his
		leg.  He pulled himself to the shore
		and a lion attacked him.  It ate one
		of his arms.  He dragged himself
		through the desert on the way home
		and a scorpion stung his eye.  So he
		only had one eye.  When he reached
		the village I sat with him.  I said,
		"You have lost a leg, an arm and one
		eye.  You must have a mighty will to
		live."  He said, "No, Lord, it's
		just better than the alternative."

Maximus finally looks at him.

					JUBA
		Life is a gift from our fathers to
		us.  Who are you to give it up for
		lack of lifting a spoon?

Maximus does not respond.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba are being observed.  Proximo stands in
the shadows of the compound and watches intently.

EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - PROVINCIAL STREETS - DAY

Blood appears to be flowing across an oxen's back.  But
the blood is too rich, too red.

The oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the
crowded streets of the town.  Hanging above the street is
dyed wool drying in the sun.  Vermilion and crimson dyes
drip down and splash across the oxen -- and splash across
the gladiators.

Maximus, Juba, the formidable Vibius are chained in the
back of the wagon.  Also the frightened Scribe.

Proximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon.  Proximo
has an umbrella over him, colored with years of dripping
dyes.

They pass a banner honoring Vibius, the star of Proximo's
stable.

Meanwhile, the terrified Scribe is almost weeping,
chattering nervously to Vibius, chained next to him:

					SCRIBE
		I know nothing of armaments and
		warfare!  I'm a scribe -- I write
		down words!  I can write down seven
		languages --

					VIBIUS
		Be still.

					SCRIBE
		I don't -- how do you hold the
		sword?!  I've never held a sword!

					VIBIUS
		You point the sharp end at your
		opponent and you shove it in his
		guts.

					SCRIBE
		I can't -- I --

He suddenly vomits.

					VIBIUS
			(calling to Proximo)
		Proximo!  You insult me with this
		carrion!  Chain him to someone else!

					PROXIMO
			(calling back)
		Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't
		be bothering you for long.

The Scribe begins to weep.

The crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators.
Occasionally throwing trash at them.  A pack of children
run alongside the wagon, chanting:

					CHILDREN
		Dead guts!  Dead guts!  Dead guts!

Maximus watches the children for a moment and then another
sight draws his attention.  Over some buildings he can see
vultures circling in the distance.

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - DAY

In the cramped holding area of the arena, a dugout beneath
the stands, Maximus and the other gladiators are waiting.

Proximo walks before them, giving a final "pep talk."  He
gazes at them evenly, his eyes going from face to face.

					PROXIMO
		Some of you say you can't fight, you
		won't fight... They all say that...
		But one day you will pick up a sword
		and thrust it into another man.  And
		the crowd will cheer you and love
		you.  And you will love them for it.
		On that day... you will be a
		gladiator.

He stops at Maximus.

					PROXIMO
		In this life, we all die.  All we
		can choose is how we die.  And how
		we are remembered.  Be remembered
		proudly.

Drums are heard from the arena.  Proximo nods to a waiting
blacksmith.

The blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's
wrists -- chaining them together in teams of two by a
chain about four feet long.

The blacksmith is about to chain Maximus to the Scribe.

					PROXIMO
		No...
			(he points to Juba)
		... give the Spaniard to him.  Give
		the Scribe to Vibius.

Proximo nods to Vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon
see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering
Scribe.

Proximo watches the blacksmith shackle Maximus and Juba
together and then strides off.

					JUBA
			(to Maximus)
		Are we going to fight each other?

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DAY

Proximo sits in a box with several other GLADIATOR
TRAINERS.  They drink wine and eat constantly.  A
perpetual chatter of wagers and odds and side bets.

The arena is only sparsely attended this day.

					PROXIMO
		Make it 600 sesterces for each
		decapitation.

					TRAINER #1
		How many strokes?

					PROXIMO
		Two.

					TRAINER #1
		For the great Vibius, one stroke.

					PROXIMO
		Done.  400 sesterces for two
		strokes.

In the arena:

Proximo's chained teams enter the arena, five teams.
Maximus and Juba are chained together.  Some of the small
crowd cheers for Vibius.  He acknowledges the cheers.  He
is chained to the weeping Scribe.

In the box:

Trainer #1 laughs.

					TRAINER #1
			(re: Vibius)
		Who's he with?

					PROXIMO
		A Greek Scribe.

					TRAINER #1
		I'll raise the wager.

					PROXIMO
			(smiles)
		Give me odds, friend.

In the arena:

From the opposite end of the arena a dozen armored, very
scary Andabatae thunder into the arena.  Some of the crowd
cheers.

The Andabatae immediately race for the chained teams and
the battle is on.

Vibius spins into action -- dragging the weeping Scribe
after him as he circles opponents and fights -- the Scribe
is almost instantly killed -- Vibius immediately hacks
through the Scribe's wrist and frees himself, as Proximo
surely intended.  Vibius is now free to fight alone,
swinging the chain as an additional weapon.

Juba's eyes dart everywhere as he tries to move with
Maximus -- Maximus neither helps nor hinders -- allowing
Juba to pull him along --

Proximo, now that his star Vibius is safe, watched Maximus
and Juba closely.

Juba fights well, with a strange elegance, his body
flowing like liquid -- but he is inexperienced.  He
strikes a few blows and then tries to move away -- finally
he is in trouble -- cornered -- a huge Andabata is slicing
at him -- it is a desperate battle -- Juba is losing --
his sword is slammed away -- the Andabata raises his sword
for the kill --

And Maximus strikes.

With a sudden roar he EXPLODES into action -- he swings
past Juba and blocks the blow meant for Juba -- then he
slashes the Andabata -- killing him -- he pulls Juba after
him as he fights --

It is a dazzling display of Maximus' skill -- he moves
through the Andabatae at amazing speed -- spinning around
Juba and protecting him -- slashing ruthlessly -- pulling
Juba after him and commanding the battle -- Juba recovers
a sword and they fight together.

In the box:

Proximo watches, smiles.  A gladiator is born.

EXT.  ROME - WAGON - DAY

SENATOR GRACCHUS, an imposing, moral and corpulent man in
his 60's, is riding in a luxurious wagon with Senator
Gaius.

And CAPTAIN MARCELLUS, the handsome Head of the Roman City
Guard.

Their wagon slowly maneuvers through the crowded streets
of Rome.  The cosmopolitan bustle of the great urban
center is everywhere around them.

					GRACCHUS
		We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter
		and it is spreading... we have
		looting at the granaries... we have
		so much filth in the Tiber that the
		water is undrinkable... we have
		Praetorian Guard units that are
		demanding protection payments from
		the merchants at the exchange --

					MARCELLUS
		My City Guard units have tried to
		curtail these excesses but no
		constabulary can police the entire
		city.  And the Praetorians outnumber
		us two to one.

					GRACCHUS
		Rome dies as the Emperor plays at
		beneficence.  At least Nero gave us
		music!

					GAIUS
		Do you think he'll listen to us?

					GRACCHUS
		It is his duty to hear the will of
		the Senate.

Their wagon stops -- hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic
jam of chariots, wagons and sedan chairs.

					GRACCHUS
		Not to mention the damn traffic!

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

Emperor Commodus is standing before a group of male
children and their tutors in his throne room.

The throne room is still very much the province of his
father.  Manuscripts and astronomical charts and papyrus
scrolls and wax tablets litter the heavy desk.  A large
bust of Marcus Aurelius is in one corner.

Lucilla and Senator Falco are present.  So too Senators
Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus.

A well-rehearsed child presents Commodus with a laurel
wreath.

					CHILD
		We honor Caesar with the laurel to
		show our love and appreciation for
		his benevolence.

					COMMODUS
		Caesar is honored to accept your
		tribute, Citizen Scholar.

The child smiles and moves back to his fellows.

					COMMODUS
			(to all)
		It is the most sacred duty of the
		Emperor to oversee the education of
		the young.  If I could leave no
		other legacy than the scholarship of
		all children my life would be
		blessed.  Tutors, you hold the
		future of Rome in your hands.  Teach
		them well so that they will bring
		honor to the Empire.  I salute you.

Commodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor.

The tutors bow in response and herd the children out.

					COMMODUS
		Look at them, Senators... my truest
		gift to Rome.

					GRACCHUS
		Darling children, to be sure, now if
		I may proceed?

					COMMODUS
			(sighs)
		Very well...

Commodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at
Marcus' scrolls as:

					GRACCHUS
		Caesar, your presence in Rome is an
		invaluable opportunity to begin
		correcting some of the ills that
		have beset the city since your
		father went to the wars.  We would
		like to --

					COMMODUS
		Peace, good Gracchus, peace...

Commodus slowly begins pushing Marcus' papyrus scrolls off
the desk to the floor, one by one, as:

					COMMODUS
		My beloved father was a careless
		shepherd to his flock.  I shall be a
		good father to my children.  I shall
		remain in Rome and show them how
		they are loved.

					GRACCHUS
		With respect, sire, the people don't
		need love -- they need law.  The
		Senate has prepared a series of
		protocols to begin addressing the
		corruption in the city --
			(Gaius hands him a
			scroll)
		-- starting with basic sanitation in
		the Hebrew Quarter.  If Caesar could
		study this and --

					COMMODUS
		You see that's the very problem,
		isn't it, my old, old friend?  My
		father spent all his time at study.
		At books and learning and
		philosophy...

As Commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk,
tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave.  The chair is
whisked away.

					COMMODUS
		He spent his twilight hours reading
		scrolls from the Senate.  All the
		while, the people were forgotten.

					GRACCHUS
		The Senate is the people.

					COMMODUS
		I doubt many of the people eat so
		well as you do, Senator Gracchus...

As Commodus speaks he moves to the bust of Marcus, studies
it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is
whisked away.  Lucilla watches this closely.

					COMMODUS
		I doubt many of the people have such
		splendid armor, Captain Marcellus.
		Or such fine mistresses, Senator
		Gaius.  No... only their true father
		knows what the people need.  I shall
		show them they are loved.  I shall
		hold them to my bosom and embrace
		them tightly --

					GRACCHUS
		Have you ever embraced someone dying
		of plague, sire?

Commodus stops.  Looks at him.  A lethal moment.

					COMMODUS
		No.  But if you interrupt me one
		more time I assure you that you
		shall.  I will emulate the immortal
		Caesars of the past.  I will give
		the people what they truly want.
		Starting this day I will draw all of
		Rome to the Colosseum.  I will give
		them bread.  And they will want
		nothing more.

Startled looks between Gracchus, Gaius and Marcellus.

					GRACCHUS
		You want to hold games?

					COMMODUS
		Not just any games, Senator!  A
		series of games that will make the
		Gods envious and leave my children
		happy!  I will subsidize the arena
		from this day forth -- and I will
		culminate this celebration in a
		great spectacle the likes of which
		the world has never seen!  A great
		spectacle to honor my father!
		Magnificent, unending weeks of
		festivity all in the name of Marcus
		Aurelius!

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		If I may, Caesar... how are you
		going to pay for this?

					COMMODUS
		That is not your concern.

Gracchus ignores a warning look from Gaius.

					GRACCHUS
		Respectfully, sire, taxation and
		import duties are the exclusive
		province of the Senate --

Commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral
violence that everyone is shocked --

					COMMODUS
		MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND
		I WILL HONOR HIM! -- AND THE PEOPLE
		WILL LOVE ME! -- AND THE SENATE WILL
		OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL
		BURN!  BURN!  BURN! -- I WILL HAVE
		ORDER!

He snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away.
Senator Falco quickly follows.

A dreadful silence.

Then:

					LUCILLA
		Gentlemen, in the future do not
		concern my brother with these
		matters.  Come to me.

She sweeps out.

A beat.

					MARCELLUS
		Games?  He wants to hold games?

					GAIUS
		It's madness.

					GRACCHUS
		No... it's not...

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		He knows who Rome is.  Rome is the
		mob.  He will conjure magic for them
		and they will be distracted.  And he
		will takes their lives.  And he will
		take their freedom.  And still they
		will roar.  The beating heart of
		Rome isn't the marble of the Senate.
		It's the sand of the Colosseum.  He
		will give them death.  And they will
		love him for it.

INT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - TUNNELS - DAY

Maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and
cramped, serpentine trench-like tunnels that lead to the
arena.

We don't really see Maximus well in the dark tunnels.

Proximo scurries to keep up with him -- they brush past
gladiators who line the walls.  Some are wounded, some are
being attended to by surgeons, some are shell-shocked,
some are nervously waiting to go on, whispering prayers.

We twist and turn in the tunnels with Proximo and Maximus
as:

					PROXIMO
			(quickly)
		I've wagered on you against the
		Celts -- ignore the others and go
		for them -- there are two axe-and-
		net and two long spear.  Now the
		Celts aren't used to the sun so you
		have the advantage there...

The roar of the crowd is growing, they are nearing the
arena...

					PROXIMO
		And keep them moving, their lungs
		aren't strong, ground the spears as
		soon as you can and then go for the
		ax-men.  If you get all four there's
		an extra bonus so don't be
		distracted by the Spartans...

Without a word to Proximo, or a moment's hesitation,
Maximus strides into the arena.

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DAY

We continue with Maximus as he strides into the roaring
arena.

We finally see him in the blazing sunlight -- he wears
traditional gladiator armor and now has longer hair and a
beard --

A battle is already in progress, fighting and dead and
dying gladiators crowd the arena --

We stay with Maximus as he wades through his opponents,
fighting them heroically, slashing through them without
stopping --

The large crowd cheers mightily -- chants of "Spaniard!
Spaniard!  Spaniard!"

We stay with Maximus as he cuts through the four Celts
like a scythe through wheat and then we dramatically pull
up and away --

Taking in the roaring arena and the hero.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT

A large mess area has been set up.  The tables around the
compound are crowded with gladiators.  Guards everywhere.

Maximus and Juba enter.  Move to get food.  All
conversation gradually drains away as the other gladiators
watch them.  Silence.

Maximus and Juba note the strange silence as they move to
a large table.

Vibius is at the table with a number of other gladiators.
There are no places for Maximus and Juba.

Vibius stands and kicks two other gladiators off their
bench.

					VIBIUS
		MOVE ASIDE!  THIS IS A TABLE FOR
		MEN!

Maximus and Juba sit.

Vibius remains standing.  He begins to pound on the table
with his fist.  Soon all the gladiators are pounding on
their tables.  It is a cacophonous din honoring Maximus.

INT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound,
sipping wine.  Various gladiators can be seen working out
below.

A guard brings Maximus.  Proximo nods for the guard to
leave.

					PROXIMO
			(holding up a plate)
		Butterfly?

The plate is filled with honeyed butterflies, their wings
still moving slightly.

Maximus shakes his head.  Proximo pops one into his mouth.
He chews as he looks at Maximus.

					PROXIMO
		Perhaps you'd like a woman?

Maximus shakes his head.

					PROXIMO
		Boy?

Maximus shakes his head.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		Gold?

Maximus shakes his head.

					PROXIMO
		Well, I have nothing left to offer
		you!  A man who turns down a
		butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold
		confuses me.  Personally, I'd grab
		them all and then grab some more
		because the Gods are fanciful and
		take us at their whim.  Does the
		Spaniard have any needs?

Maximus shakes his head.

A beat.  Proximo studies him.

					PROXIMO
		You fight like a soldier.  You have
		wounds like a soldier who has been
		on long campaigns.  You eye the
		world around you like an enemy.
		What is your name, Roman soldier?

					MAXIMUS
		Gladiator.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		And nothing more?

					MAXIMUS
		Nothing more.

A beat.

Proximo watches Maximus very closely for the following:

					PROXIMO
		In two days we leave for Rome.

Maximus' eyes suddenly flash to Proximo.  He is
transfixed, his eyes burning.

					PROXIMO
		Ah... so it's Rome you want.  Well
		you shall have her, Gladiator.  The
		new Emperor has ordered a series of
		matches to culminate in a grand
		spectacle.  If you do well I shall
		become very, very rich.  If you do
		well enough I shall set you free.
		Is it freedom you want?

A beat.

Maximus shakes his head.

					PROXIMO
			(quietly)
		Not even that.

					MAXIMUS
			(barely controlled)
		The Emperor -- will he be there?

					PROXIMO
		Oh yes.  He's apparently quite mad
		about the games.  Spending a
		fortune, which is, needless to say,
		good for me again.  But what is good
		for you, Gladiator?

					MAXIMUS
		Have you -- how does one meet the
		Emperor?

					PROXIMO
		As a gladiator?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					PROXIMO
		One doesn't.

A beat.  Proximo sees that Maximus' mind is racing.

					PROXIMO
		Except... If one has proven oneself
		in battle.  If at the end of the
		games you are the final man standing
		-- the Emperor will present you with
		a small wooden sword.  The sword is
		your freedom.

					MAXIMUS
		He give it personally?

					PROXIMO
		He did to me...
			(Maximus is surprised
			at this)
		Our great father Marcus Aurelius
		looked into my eyes and touched me
		on the shoulder.

					MAXIMUS
		You knew Marcus?

					PROXIMO
		I didn't know him.  He touched me on
		the shoulder.  Just once.  But that
		was enough.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		All right, Gladiator.  We shall go
		to Rome together and have bloody
		adventures.  The Great Whore will
		suckle us until we are fat and happy
		and can't suck another drop.  That
		is Rome.

INT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - OUTSIDE ROME - EVENING

Maximus is crouched in the back of an enclosed slave wagon
with Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators.

In the distance, Rome.

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Commodus sits on his bed, rubbing his aching head.
Lucilla is preparing a drink for him, a medicinal tonic.

					COMMODUS
		All my desires are splitting my head
		to pieces -- there's so much I want
		to do -- but all my efforts to show
		my children they are loved go
		unappreciated by those dragons in
		the Senate --

					LUCILLA
			(mixing tonic)
		Quiet, brother...

Unseen by him, she adds a little special powder to the
drink from a vial secreted in her robe.

					LUCILLA
		Leave the Senate to me.  Don't
		trouble yourself.

					COMMODUS
		All I want is to be a good father to
		my people.  Why don't they
		understand that?

She goes to him.

					LUCILLA
		Shhh.  The tonic will help...

She takes a sip and then hands it to him.

					LUCILLA
		Yes, just drink this down.

She sits on the edge of the bed.  He drinks as:

					COMMODUS
		I must take a firmer hand with them.
		They must know their father can be
		firm.  As our father was firm with
		us.

					LUCILLA
		Our father lost his way.  His
		mistake was believing the old songs
		of the "Republic."  We know better.
		So let the Senate talk.  They have
		no real power.

					COMMODUS
		Yes... yes... you always know the
		way.  You were always so wise in
		these matters...
			(he takes her hand)
		You know if I didn't have my duty to
		Rome I think I should be an artist.
		I should go away and paint pictures
		of the sea and leave all the
		politics to you...

A beat.  He is sleepy, he lies back on his bed.

					COMMODUS
		Will you stay with me?

					LUCILLA
			(smiles gently)
		Still afraid of the dark, brother?

					COMMODUS
		Still.  Always.

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		My dreams would terrify the world.

A beat.

					LUCILLA
		I'll stay with you until you are
		asleep.

					COMMODUS
			(falling asleep)
		And after... just sit with me.  Keep
		me safe...

He is asleep.

She watches him for a moment and then rises.

She goes.

INT.  PALACE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lucilla moves down a long corridor in the palace and blows
out candles as she goes.

She finally arrives at her own chamber and enters...

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Senators Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus are
waiting.

					LUCILLA
		He's asleep.  Be quick.

					GRACCHUS
		We've taking a sounding, the Senate
		is with us.

					LUCILLA
		Good.

					GRACCHUS
		But we are only words.  We are air.
		We need steel.

					MARCELLUS
		The City Guard is faithful to the
		Republic.  But we don't stand a
		chance against the Praetorians.

					LUCILLA
		Can they be bought?

					MARCELLUS
		They are zealots -- totally
		committed to your brother.

					GRACCHUS
		Well, can they at least be rented
		for a day?

					MARCELLUS
		I doubt it.  He pays them exorbitant
		salaries and lets them loot and
		extort as they see fit.  The city
		belongs to them.

					LUCILLA
		And they've started arresting
		scholars now.  Anyone who dares
		speak out -- even satirists and
		chroniclers.

					MARCELLUS
		And mathematicians and Christians.
		All to fill the arena.

					GAIUS
		And what pays for it?  These games
		are costing a fortune and yet we
		have no new taxes.

					LUCILLA
		The future.  The future pays for
		it...

A beat.  She looks at them.

					LUCILLA
		He's started selling the grain
		reserves.   

					GAIUS
		No.

					MARCELLUS
		That can't be true...

					LUCILLA
		He's selling Rome's reserves of
		grain.  The people will be starving
		in two years.  I hope they are
		enjoying the spectacles because soon
		enough they will be dead because of
		them.

					MARCELLUS
		Rome must know this.

					LUCILLA
		And who will tell them?!  You,
		Marcellus?  You, Senator Gaius?
		Will you make a speech on the Senate
		floor denouncing my brother?  And
		then see your family in the
		Colosseum?  What town-crier would
		dare?

A long beat.

					LUCILLA
		He must die.

A beat as her words sink in.

					GAIUS
		The Praetorians would only seize
		control themselves.

					LUCILLA
		No -- cut off the head and the snake
		cannot strike.

					GRACCHUS
		Lucilla, Gaius is right.  Until the
		City Guard can neutralize the
		Praetorians we can accomplish
		nothing.

					MARCELLUS
		And I haven't enough men.

					LUCILLA
		What about the army?

					GAIUS
		No Roman army has entered the
		capital in a hundred years.

					LUCILLA
		So we do nothing?!

A door opens, a voice...

					LUCIUS' VOICE
		Mother...

An eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy.  He is
LUCIUS, Lucilla's son.

					LUCIUS
		I heard voices...

					LUCILLA
			(going to him)
		It's all right, darling, you --

Lucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus:

					LUCIUS
			(running to Gracchus)
		Senator!  What did you bring me?!

He leaps onto Gracchus -- Gracchus laughs and pulls
something from his robe.

					GRACCHUS
		For you prince Lucius... a sea
		monster!

Gracchus gives Lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea
serpent.

					GRACCHUS
		Off the coast of Achaea they grow
		twenty times this size, with
		snapping teeth to devour any nasty
		Praetorians they come across... now,
		where is Achaea?

					LUCIUS
		Below Macedonia!

					GRACCHUS
		Show me on the map.

Lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at Achaea.  We
sense this is an old game between them.

					LUCILLA
		Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in
		shortly.

					LUCIUS
			(to Gracchus)
		Thank you, Senator Mountain!

					GRACCHUS
		You're welcome, Prince Anthill!

Lucius goes.  Lucilla shuts the door after him.  A moment.
She turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes.

					LUCILLA
		What are you going to do?

Gracchus goes to her, holds her.

					GRACCHUS
		Peace child... One dark night the
		Gods will light our path.  They will
		give us the voice we need.  Have
		faith in that.  Have faith.

INT./ EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - SLAVE WAGON - NIGHT

Maximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a
hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart.

He can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass.  But the
images are not what he expected.  Alongside the undeniable
glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius
spoke of are readily apparent.

Maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on
carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending
and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian
Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent
architecture of the city -- he sees starving children
begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out
for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of
sophistication and depravity, of civilization and
corruption.

He sits back in the cart, deep in thought.  Vibius looks
at him.

					VIBIUS
		Not what you expected?

					MAXIMUS
		No.

					VIBIUS
		Rome is nothing but a slaughter
		house.  And we are the meat.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

The slave wagon pulls up to Proximo's rather grand Roman
compound.  Guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon
drives in...

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Inside the gates is a large courtyard, much like Proximo's
Moroccan school but much more impressive.  A fountain with
an enormous statue of the war god Mars is central in the
courtyard.

The gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the
long journey.  Vibius leads Maximus and Juba to the
statue.  He wades through the fountain and kisses the toe
of Mars.

					VIBIUS
		Tradition.  He watches over us.

Juba steps up and kisses the toe.

					VIBIUS
			(to Maximus)
		Oh go on, it won't kill you.

Maximus kisses the toe as well.

					PROXIMO
			(calling to them)
		Stop that!  You'll get some
		monstrous disease and then you'll be
		worth nothing to me!

Guards come and lead them to their cells, which line one
side of the courtyard.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Later.  Maximus and Juba again share a cell.  It is more
comfortable than their cell in Morocco, befitting Maximus'
new status as one of the "stars."  A high, barred window
on one wall opens to the city.  Another barred window is
directly over them, twenty feet above.

Maximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out.

And sees at last... The Colosseum.

It is a breathtaking sight.  Monolithic Albert Speer-like
columns of light shine up from the Colosseum.  It seems to
illuminate the whole city and the heavens above.

Maximus drops back to the floor.

					JUBA
		Do you think it will be much
		different?  Here in Rome?

					MAXIMUS
		Bigger arena.  Same killing.

A beat.

					JUBA
		Are you scared for tomorrow?

					MAXIMUS
		No.

A beat.

					JUBA
		Me too.

A beat.

					JUBA
		I never though it would be so easy
		to kill.

A beat.

					JUBA
		So you're finally home.

					MAXIMUS
		This isn't my home.

					JUBA
		For all Romans... this is home.

A beat.

					JUBA
			(quietly)
		Among my people we honor the soil of
		our home.  Our ancestors are in that
		soil.  All their dreams live there.
		I will never see my home again.  The
		soil is dead and no one honors them,
		so the dreams die.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		Perhaps one day you'll return.

Juba looks at him.

					JUBA
		How can I go back?  I am not what I
		was.  When a man kills for no
		reason, he has lost himself.

A long beat.

Juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing.  A
haunting lament in his native tongue.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

A flurry of images from around the Colosseum, the energy
mounting.  At this point we see practically nothing of the
inside of the Colosseum:

Slaves are balancing high above the empty arena.  They are
on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that
provide shade below...

Merchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside
of the Colosseum.  They sell everything from food to magic
elixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs.  They immediately
start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their
products...

Gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets.  They
have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup...

Citizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the
pickpockets.  We see whole families with picnic lunches...

Ferocious animals are brought into the Colosseum in barred
cages...

In the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice
their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and
contortionists...

Richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they
feign indifference to the hooting mob...

Mounted City Guard police units try to retain some
order...

Gamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly...

Finally, we see Maximus and the other gladiators in a
slave cart.  Maximus watches everything as the slave cart
disappears into the Colosseum...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - ROUTE TO HOLDING CELLS - DAY

The interior of the Colosseum is a busy world unto itself.

Maximus and the others are lead by Proximo's guards down a
long ramp and past countless animal cages.  Gamblers
circulate everywhere and observe the warriors, angling for
the best odds and the best matches.

Maximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels
of the Colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm.
Numerous cells line the walls.  Racks and racks of
weaponry and armor.

And, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy
machinery of the spectacles above.  Huge "elevator"
platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are
manned by teams of sweating slaves.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Finally, Proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their
holding cells.  These cells are right at the edge of the
arena.  Barred windows offer a sand-level view of the
action.

Maximus immediately goes to a window and looks out.

He cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does
see transfixes him.

A band of Christians are huddled together.  An eerie
silence from the Colosseum but for the prayers of the
Christians.

Maximus watches them.  One little girl peels past her
mother's arm.  She sees Maximus.  She smiles.

Suddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by Maximus
-- they roar into the arena --

We do not see the carnage.  We watch Maximus' face as we
hear the sounds of the slaughter.

And the sound of the roaring crowd.

Maximus finally cannot watch.  He drops his head.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - TRAINER'S LAIR - DAY

Proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the
Colosseum's orator and majordomo, CASSIUS.  They are
haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena
itself.  Huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and
wagers and odds.

Colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on
the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing
bouts.

The roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the
Christians can clearly be heard.

					CASSIUS
		... and the Emperor will have no
		more animal battles today --

Upset roars from some of the trainers.

					TRAINER #1
		You promised me a bear match,
		Cassius!

					TRAINER #2
		I have ten damned gorillas!  You
		said gorillas yesterday!

					CASSIUS
		Talk to the man in the imperial box.
		Who has the next slot...?
			(he checks the
			boards)
		-- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and
		Proximo --
			(to Proximo)
		-- Nice to have you back, you
		piratical bastard -- now listen, the
		Emperor wants the Carthage
		spectacle.

The four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance --

					PROXIMO
		No -- have pity, Cassius -- !

					TRAINER #3
		My men are too good for -- !

					CASSIUS
		You give us the Carthage match or
		lose your spot on the rotation --
		but don't worry -- gold is flowing
		from the Emperor's fingers.

					TRAINER #3
		It'll cost you --

					PROXIMO
		I won't do it for less than 100,000
		sesterces -- !

					TRAINER #4
		120,000!  All I have is my best
		Thracians!

					CASSIUS
			(to Proximo)
		And I want to see this famous
		Spaniard of yours -- his reputation
		soars from the provinces.  The
		people are eager for him --

					PROXIMO
		I won't throw my Spaniard into a
		spectacle!  Damn you and damn the
		rotation!

					CASSIUS
		You will and the price will be
		90,000 sesterces each --
			(to all)
		-- which you all know is exorbitant
		-- AND IF YOU EXTORTING BLOOD-WHORES
		TRY TO PAWN OFF LESSER FIGHTERS ON
		ME I WILL SEE YOU DEAD IN THE ARENA
		TOMORROW!

					TRAINER #4
		My Thracians are worth -- !

					CASSIUS
		Give me your best, brothers.  They
		die before Caesar.

He strides back to the arena.  The touts instantly begin
making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious
"Carthage Spectacle" as some of the trainers hurry out.

Proximo walks with Trainer #4:

					PROXIMO
		I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will
		kill at least one of your Thracians.

					TRAINER #4
		30,000?!  On a Spaniard?!  That
		provincial sun has curdled your
		brain!

					PROXIMO
		Then make the wager, you smug
		bastard!

They disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the
while.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus, Juba, Vibius and another of Proximo's gladiators
are being armed.  They all wear mask-like helmets.

Proximo hurries to them.

					PROXIMO
		All right -- there are three other
		teams, four men each --
			(to Maximus)
		You know what a Thracian looks like?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes, but --

					PROXIMO
		Ignore the others -- go for the
		Thracians.  The sun is to the east
		-- over the gate -- keep your back
		to the gate and you won't have the
		sun.

					MAXIMUS
		What -- ?

Trumpets begin sounding from the arena.

					PROXIMO
		Hurry -- !

The guards quickly bustle the four toward a gate leading
to a dark tunnel to the arena.

					PROXIMO
		Die well and we'll sing songs about
		you for a generation.

Short swords are shoved into their hands and the gate
rises.  They are pushed into the dark tunnel leading to
the arena.  The gate closes behind them.

The four gladiators stand for a moment and then slowly
walk down the tunnel to...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

At last we see it.

The mighty Colosseum Arena.

Nothing we could have possibly imagined could have
prepared us for the sight of the thousands and thousands
of screaming spectators, the row after row of cheering
faces.

It is staggering.

But for Maximus none of this exists.  His full attention
is focused on one spot alone.  The Imperial Box.

He can see Commodus and Lucilla sitting in the box.  The
box is elevated fifteen feet above the arena floor at the
top of a sheer black marble wall.  A cohort of fifty
imposing Praetorian Guard Archers surround the box.
Commodus' personal Body Guard of six Centurions actually
stand in the box itself, eyes constantly watching like
modern Secret Service agents.

Commodus is untouchable.

Meanwhile, three teams move from different entrances to
the arena.

As Cassius orates to the crowd:

					CASSIUS
		This day we reach back to hallowed
		antiquity to bring you... THE FALL
		OF MIGHTY CARTHAGE...!
			(the crowd cheers)
		... On the barren armies of the
		barbarian Hannibal!  Ferocious
		mercenaries and warriors of all
		brute nations bent on merciless
		conquest!  Your Emperor is pleased
		to give you... THE BARBARIAN HORDE!

He gestures to the gladiators in the arena.  The crowd
laughs, jeering the "barbarians."

The drummers begin pounding out a more insistent, heroic
beat.

					CASSIUS
		But on that illustrious day the Gods
		sent against them Rome's greatest
		warriors...!  The very life-image of
		nobility and glorious valor... who
		would on this day, and on these same
		arid Numidian deserts, decide THE
		FATE OF THE EMPIRE... Your Emperor
		is pleased to give you... THE
		LEGIONNAIRES OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS!!

The crowd EXPLODES in cheers as the huge doors at one end
of the arena suddenly burst open and ten chariots thunder
in --

Each chariot has a driver and an archer, both dressed in
theatrical versions of the familiar Roman Lorica
Segmentata.

A chaos of dust -- and the battle is on --

The chariots zoom around the arena -- the archers keeping
up a deadly hail of arrows.

Maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kills
the charioteer and archer -- he dramatically leaps from
the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free.

And Maximus takes control, we see the General of the Felix
Regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders and
leads his gladiators in battle.  They follow him
faithfully, his stern commands unquestioned.

His strategies are quick and smart, he makes the
gladiators work together.

This kind of slaughter could last for hours...

We see flashes of the endless battle... Maximus races on
his horse past another chariot, kills the driver, the
chariot smashes into a wall... the sun sinks lower, the
shadows on the sand lengthen... areas of the sand are
swamps of blood, Juba slips, pulls himself up fighting...
Maximus uses Vibius to create a diversion, two chariots
collide... the crowd roars... a gladiator is dragged
between a chariot and the side wall of the arena... the
drummers pound out their relentless tattoo...

Finally...

Maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot.

We can see that Juba and Vibius and a few other gladiators
are still alive.  The rest of the arena is polluted with
the dead and injured.

Maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final
chariot -- the charioteer whips his horses and zooms
toward Maximus --

The crowd is breathless -- watching the final battle --

Maximus and the chariot speed toward each other -- like
Medieval jousters --

And collide in a flashing explosion of steel --

Maximus sails from his horse -- as the charioteer sails
from his chariot --

Maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up, he races
to the final charioteer.  The charioteer is defeated but
not dead.

Maximus glances around, all his opponents are defeated.

He stands over the final charioteer.  Then he simply
tosses down his sword.

The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy.  But
then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after
wave of adulation for the hero of the day.

Maximus looks around, taking it all in.

Then he turns to the Imperial Box.

Maximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box.  The
Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing
down at him.

Maximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask.
Commodus returns his gaze, curious.

The crowd is intrigued, growing quiet.  What is going on?

Then Maximus simply turns and begins walking away.

					COMMODUS
		Slave!  Who are you?

The Colosseum is suddenly silent.  The Emperor is speaking
to a gladiator.

Maximus keeps walking.

					COMMODUS
		SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?

Maximus keeps walking, his fists clenched now.

Commodus suddenly grabs a spear from a nearby Praetorian
and hurls it with perfect aim -- the crowd gasps -- the
spear sails past Maximus -- actually nicking his shoulder
-- it slices into the sand ahead of Maximus.

Maximus stops.

					COMMODUS
		SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?!

Maximus can hold it no longer.  He spins to Commodus --
ripping off his helmet mask -- and THUNDERING:

					MAXIMUS
		I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE
		FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND
		SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS
		AURELIUS!

Commodus eyes shoot wide -- Lucilla bolts up -- Gracchus
leans forward -- Proximo is stunned -- the crowd is
mystified --

					MAXIMUS
		I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND
		HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND
		LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND
		I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE!

The Praetorian Archers tense their bows -- ready to kill
the defiant slave --

But something extraordinary stops them.  Almost as one
being the crowd roars -- they leaps to their feet and
thrust their thumbs up!  They cheer and stomp their
approval of Maximus.

Commodus looks around at the people of Rome, amazed.

He finally plasters on a benevolent smile and thrusts his
thumb up!  The Praetorians lower their bows.

And the crowd cheers.  Never in the long, long history of
the Colosseum have they ever seen such a thing.

Maximus leads his gladiators out of the arena.

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

To our great surprise, Commodus is not raging.  He sits
quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model
of the Colosseum.  He moves model pieces around in the
Colosseum, planning his festival.

Lucilla stands, tense.

					COMMODUS
		Why is he still alive?

					LUCILLA
		I don't know.

					COMMODUS
		He shouldn't be alive.  That vexes
		me.  I am terribly vexed...

Lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the
explosion.  He carefully moves some model pieces in the
arena.

					COMMODUS
		There, that's better.  Do you like
		the platform here?

					LUCILLA
		Mmm.

					COMMODUS
		I do too.  Simple, elegant...

Lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at Commodus'
unusual serenity.

					COMMODUS
		Father would have wanted something
		more ornate but he's dead now.

A beat.  Commodus laughs.  A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Maximus Meridas haunts me.  I see
		Father turning away from me and
		gazing at him.  How many times did I
		suffer that indignity, I wonder?

					LUCILLA
		What are you going to do?

					COMMODUS
		I'm going to kill him.

					LUCILLA
		Good.

					COMMODUS
			(glances at her)
		Oh, you're too clever, Sister.
		Don't tell me part of you won't weep
		for him.

					LUCILLA
		When he defies my brother the
		Emperor, he defies me.  But you
		shouldn't send assassins.

					COMMODUS
		No?

					LUCILLA
		The people embraced him today.  They
		will be expecting his next match...
			(she kneels next to
			him)
		... let him die in the arena like
		the slave he is.  Let the people see
		what comes of defying Caesar.

A beat as he looks at her.

					COMMODUS
		He wounded you deeply, didn't he?
		Long ago.

She does not answer.

					COMMODUS
		Nonetheless, your political acumen
		is, as always, unerring.

He picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena.  He
looks at the model tiger and smiles.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus silently awaits Commodus' assassins with Juba.
They hear footsteps outside the cell.  Maximus stands,
preparing for death.

					JUBA
			(also standing)
		I will fight with you.

					MAXIMUS
		This isn't your battle.

					JUBA
		Better to die for a friend than to
		die for gold.

The door swings open and they are surprised to see Proximo
sweeping in with a cloaked woman.  The woman gives Proximo
a bag of money.

					PROXIMO
		Enjoy yourself, Madame...
			(he glances to
			Maximus)
		General, perform well and there will
		be riches for you.

He beckons to Juba, they go, shutting the door behind
them.  The woman pulls off her cloak, it is Lucilla.

Maximus glares at her, his muscles tensing.

					LUCILLA
		Rich matrons pay well to be
		pleasured by the bravest champions.

Maximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the
spot.  He finally bumps into a wall of the cell.

					MAXIMUS
		I knew your brother would send
		assassins.  I didn't think he would
		send his best.

					LUCILLA
		Maximus, listen to me --

					MAXIMUS
		My family were crucified and burnt
		while they were still alive.

					LUCILLA
		I knew nothing of that.

					MAXIMUS
			(low)
		Don't lie to me.

					LUCILLA
		I wept for them.

					MAXIMUS
		Don't.

A long, tense moment.

She does not look at him.

					LUCILLA
		Do you know what it is to be the
		daughter of the Emperor?  I learned
		on the night my father had my
		husband killed.  I loved my husband
		very much.  Very... simply.  He was
		a man who believed in the Republic.
		He was a man who thought Marcus
		should be tending to Rome and not
		conquering the world.  One night my
		father had him strangled for
		conspiring with the Senate.  My
		father never spoke of it.  I never
		spoke of it.  That is what it is to
		be the daughter of Rome.

She finally looks up at Maximus.

					LUCILLA
		My son will live.  He will survive
		this cursed bloodline.  Rome will
		die and the jackals will pick her
		clean -- but my son will survive.
		Empires come and go.  Cities crumble
		to dust.  Only family matters.

A beat.  Despite himself, Maximus is moved.

					MAXIMUS
		My son was innocent.

					LUCILLA
		So is mine.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		I want your brother dead.

					LUCILLA
		So do I.

A beat.  Maximus is surprised at her direct answer.

					LUCILLA
		My son will never be safe while he
		lives.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		How do you plan it?

					LUCILLA
		The Senate is with us, and the City
		Guard.  We have growing power in the
		streets.  But we need a leader.
		Someone the people can --

					MAXIMUS
		So the crown passes to your son.

					LUCILLA
		No.  So that my son will be safe.
		So that we may leave this charnel
		house forever and never look back.
		Look into my eyes, Maximus, and
		believe what I say to you...

She rivets him intensely with her eyes.

					LUCILLA
		By all the Gods, and in the name of
		my father who loved you, and in the
		name of the husband I loved... I
		swear to stand by your side in this
		now and always.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		What is your son's name?

					LUCILLA
		Lucius Verus.  Like his father.

					MAXIMUS
		I weep for him.

A long beat.  Maximus' cold eyes give away nothing.

Lucilla turns and starts to go.  She stops, not looking
back.

					LUCILLA
		Commodus plans to kill you in your
		next match in the arena.  He's
		planning something.  I will pray for
		you.  As I have always done.

She then pulls something from her robes and sets it down,
a little bundle wrapped in cloth.  She sweeps out.  The
sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side.

Maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has
left.  He opens the cloth.  Inside are his six "ancestor"
figures.

He picks up one of the figures.  He looks at it deeply,
gently feeling along the contours with a finger.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

The Colosseum is again packed.  Commodus, Lucilla and her
son Lucius are in the Imperial Box.

It is late in the day and teams of slaves are cleaning the
arena after a bout.  They haul off carcasses and toss down
fresh sand.

Meanwhile, Cassius is orating to the crowd:

					CASSIUS
		... in his majestic charity the
		Emperor has deigned to this day
		favor the people of Rome with an
		historical final match.  Returning
		to the Colosseum today... after five
		years in retirement... Caesar is
		pleased to bring you... THE ONLY
		UNDEFEATED CHAMPION IN ROMAN
		HISTORY...
			(the crowd is going
			mad)
		... THE LEGENDARY... TIGER OF GAUL!!

The crowd erupts in paroxysms of joy as TIGER explodes
into the arena in an ornate chariot.  Tiger is a fierce
man in his 40's, his brutal, scarred face and hugely
muscled body a testament to his many years in the arena.

Tiger speeds around the rim of the arena in his chariot,
raising an arm in triumph.  The crowd roars.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Proximo stands with Maximus, who is busy strapping on
armor.

					PROXIMO
		Gods!  That old Homicide!  The
		Emperor must truly hate you.

					MAXIMUS
		What can you tell me?

					PROXIMO
		He cheats.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Tiger waits.  He stands in the center of the arena.  He
has only a traditional short sword.  The crowd is
breathless with anticipation.  As:

					CASSIUS
			(orating)
		And from the rocky promontories and
		martial bloodlines of Spain...
		representing the training lyceum of
		Proximo Antoninus... I give you...
		THE WARRIOR MAXIMUS!

The crowd cheers.  Maximus appears from his gate.  His
fans have increased in number considerably.  They eagerly
crane forward and celebrate him.

Meanwhile, Maximus looks at Tiger.  Only one man with a
sword?  Maximus approaches, cautious but confident.

He stops a few feet from Tiger.  They lock eyes, salute
each other and then turn to the Imperial Box, raising
their swords.

The crowd waits eagerly for the immortal words...

					MAXIMUS AND TIGER
		We who are about to die salute you.

The crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts
slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back --

The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and
hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are
perfectly matched --

As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over
the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels
something -- a vibration in the ground --

Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous
platforms rise into view.  On each platform is a snarling
Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of
"cornermen" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The
cornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at
ground level.

The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the
battleground.

Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and
assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the
tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just
evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another
tiger snaps at him --

Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting
off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts --

And then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams
of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit,
gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The
crowd roars.

But the fight is hardly fair.

Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen
pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a
tiger they let it out a bit.

Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally,
Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs
into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under
Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall --
a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back
-- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one
of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up
and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat.

Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed.

Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they
completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus --

Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into
him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through
his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm
into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword --

Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his
corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos --

Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with
superhuman effort so it is always between himself and
Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him --

Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he
quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground --

Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de
grace.

All eyes turn to the Emperor.

Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the
Imperial Box.  He raises his arm and gives the fatal
thumbs down.

Maximus looks up at him.

And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground,
refusing to kill Tiger.

Commodus is stunned.

The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and
then an enormous roar building.  It cascades around the
Colosseum.  It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected
act of mercy.  And the delicious act of defiance of the
Emperor.

Commodus slowly sits.

Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and
cheer for him.  Cries of "Maximus the Merciful" can be
heard.

It is the birth of a hero.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus is resting in his cell after the battle, head
down, deep in thought.

					LUCIUS' VOICE
		Is it true you're a General...?

Maximus looks up, Lucius is standing at his cell.  Maximus
has no idea who the boy is -- just another young fan --
but Maximus is immediately struck by Lucius' resemblance
to his own son.

					MAXIMUS
		I was a General.

					LUCIUS
		I saw you fight.  The Carthage
		battle too.  I've never seen so much
		courage.

					MAXIMUS
		It doesn't take courage to kill.

					LUCIUS
		My father was killed.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		I'm sorry.

					LUCIUS
		He still comes to me in my dreams.
		Do you have a father?

					MAXIMUS
		I had a father.  He wasn't really my
		father but I cared for him very much.

					LUCIUS
		I hope he comes to you in your
		dreams.  My father and I ride horses
		in mine.

These simple words strike something deep in Maximus.

Lucilla appears from the shadows and puts her hands on
Lucius' shoulders.

					LUCILLA
		Lucius, run along now.  I need to
		talk to the General.

Lucius runs off to his Male ATTENDANT, who leads him away.

A long beat as Maximus and Lucilla look at each other.

Finally:

					MAXIMUS
		Where is my army?

A drum beat is heard.  It increases throughout the
following scenes, building momentum like a Roman gallery
accelerating to ramming speed.

The conspiracy scenes are enclosed in a montage of scenes
in and around the arena showing Maximus' growing
popularity with the People of Rome...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus is fighting an opponent.

The drums continue...

INT.  THE SENATE - DAY

Lucilla conspires with Senators Gracchus and Gaius and
Captain Marcellus in a dark corner of the Senate.
Whispers.

					LUCILLA
		... Maximus will summon his army
		from Ostia and he will strike from
		the inside as his army strikes from
		the outside.  But he insists that
		the Senate be present.

					GAIUS
		We've been ordered to attend.

					LUCILLA
		How many are with us?

					GRACCHUS
		About half.  But once the tyrant is
		dead.  All.

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		I want to meet him.

					LUCILLA
		I'll arrange it.

					GAIUS
		And what of the Emperor?

A beat.

					LUCILLA
		He has withdrawn.  He's not eating.
		He doesn't go out.  He won't even
		see me... I don't know what tempests
		rage within him but...

					GRACCHUS
		We should fear for the blackest
		storm.

					LUCILLA
		Yes.

A beat.

					GAIUS
		One question... who is to be the
		actual Regicide?

A beat.  She glances at him.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus defeats his opponent.  He stands over him.  He
does not kill him.

He tosses his sword down and walks away.  The crowd goes
crazy, roaring their approval of Maximus.

Senator Falco, sits in the stands and watches with some
alarm.  He glances around as the crowd exalts Maximus.  He
is becoming a hero to the people.

The drums continue...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus returns to the holding cells.  Vibius and Juba are
waiting.

					VIBIUS
		You didn't kill him.

					MAXIMUS
		I will not kill another warrior.
		There is no honor to it.

Maximus goes.  Vibius thinks about it, listening to the
adulation of the crowd.

The drums continue...

INT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - ROMAN STREETS - DAY

Maximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on
the way from the arena.  A gang of children run alongside
the cart, cheering and chanting:

					KIDS
		Maximus the Merciful!  Maximus the
		Merciful!

The drums continue...

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus.  Lucilla
is writing on a piece of parchment.

					MAXIMUS
		Tell him we will enter Rome on the
		first day of Commodus' festival.

					LUCILLA
		And they will march on Rome for you?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.  But this letter must go to the
		lieutenant named Titus, no one else.

					LUCILLA
		Captain Marcellus will take it.  And
		his City Guard will by with you when
		you get to Rome.  Is that enough to
		face the Praetorian Guard?

					MAXIMUS
			(looks to her)
		The Felix Regiment will never be
		defeated.

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		I only have one question for you,
		General... Why?

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		You will lead an army of your
		brothers on Rome.  Many will die.
		Why?

					MAXIMUS
		I want Commodus dead.

					GRACCHUS
		That's not the reason.  Tell me the
		truth.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		Because one night an old man
		whispered to me about a dream.  I
		will die for that dream.

A long beat.

					GRACCHUS
		I knew the old man well.  And I
		loved him very much.  In our youth
		we would spend hours building that
		dream together.  After he went to
		the wars and lost his way... I was
		very cruel.  I tormented him to
		remember that dream we spoke of.

					MAXIMUS
		He did.

					GRACCHUS
		You can have no idea how much that
		means to me.

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		Any man who will die for a whispered
		dream deserves my respect.  I honor
		you, General.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Vibius defeats an opponent -- he stands over him.  He
looks around at the crowd.  Then he tosses down his sword
and walks off.

The crowd goes mad with pleasure.  Vibius eats it up,
raising his arms and soaking up the applause.

Maximus watches from the holding cells.  He smiles.

The drums continue...

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Proximo supervises as a huge banner is unfurled.  It
covers the side of a tall building.

It shows a dramatic painting of Maximus.

Proximo supervises happily as torches and braziers are lit
to illuminate the mammoth banner.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

The ending of a group fight -- Proximo's gladiators
triumphant.

The crowd waits for the delicious act of defiance.  We
note many placard and banners honoring "MAXIMUS THE
MERCIFUL."

Maximus, Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators toss down
their weapons and walk off, leaving their opponents alive.

The crowd roars.  They have completely embraced Maximus
and his fellow gladiators.

Gracchus, in the stands, laughs.

The drums finally conclude.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBER - DAY

Lucilla is with her HANDMAIDEN.  They sit before a large
mirror, the Handmaiden perfecting Lucilla's makeup for the
day.

One of Commodus' Centurion Body Guards enters, bows.

					CENTURION
		Madame, the Emperor would like to
		see you.

Lucilla quickly glances to her Handmaiden in the mirror
and then braces herself, stands, and quickly leaves with
the Centurion.

INT.  PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

Lucilla strides quickly, nervously, down the long corridor
to Commodus' chambers.  She enters...

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - DAY

Commodus is wrapped in a sheet, gazing out a window.

					LUCILLA
		Caesar...

He turns.  She stops.

He looks as if he has not slept for days.  If a word could
now sum up his clouded face it is this:  tormented.

She goes to him, embraces him.  He holds her tightly.

					COMMODUS
		I am sorry to have kept you away...
		I needed this time to think...

					LUCILLA
		Of course...

He moves away from her, slowly moving around the room.

					COMMODUS
		I limited my world to these four
		walls so as to let my mind free...
		again and again my mind settles on
		but one question... What kind of
		world are we making when the people
		of Rome prefer a slave in the arena
		to their father?

A beat.  Commodus' strange philosophical bent is unnerving
Lucilla.

					COMMODUS
		It is my responsibility to make the
		world as it should be.  How is it I
		have made this world?

					LUCILLA
		Brother, do not be influenced by the
		mob.  They are a great, faceless
		beast --

					COMMODUS
		They are not "the mob," Lucilla,
		they are the people.  They are my
		children and all I want to do is
		love them.

A beat.  He stands before a bust of Marcus Aurelius.  He
touches it.

					COMMODUS
		Our father loved Maximus... and I
		love him still... yet he defies me,
		he tasks me in front of my children.
		And they love him for it.  Just as
		Marcus loved him for it.  Tell me
		why, Lucilla.

					LUCILLA
		They see themselves in him.  They
		throw in their own sad dreams
		alongside his.  They think he fights
		for them.

					COMMODUS
		And what do I do but fight for
		them?!  I give them games to please
		them.  I strangle dissent to give
		them peace.  I empower the
		Praetorians to give them order.
		What more can I do?!

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Say I should fight him, in the
		arena.  Let my children see who the
		Gods truly favor.

					LUCILLA
		And what if he should win?

A beat.

Commodus continues to slowly move around the room.

					COMMODUS
		A God is more powerful than a man...

This odd statement hangs in the air for a moment.  Then:

					LUCILLA
		Caesar, you let this unduly worry
		you.  At best he is a passing fancy
		-- he is a name, an image on a
		banner, ephemeral -- he will be
		forgotten as the next fancy
		appears --

					COMMODUS
		But I need to know -- why do they
		love him?

					LUCILLA
		Mercy.

He stops.  Looks at her.

					LUCILLA
		He will not kill in the arena.  He
		is merciful.  As they all wish they
		were in their own hearts.

Something in her words has struck a chord in him.

					COMMODUS
		And for that moment in the arena
		they are merciful too.  For a
		moment... they are Gods.  Offering
		life.

He looks at her.

					COMMODUS
		But who can be more merciful than
		the Emperor of Rome?

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus is fighting a thick GIANT of a man.  A few quick
blows and the Giant falls -- like a mighty tree he crashes
to the sand.

The arena cheers their hero.

Maximus stands over the beaten Giant.  The crowd waits for
the famous act.

Maximus salutes the Giant and tosses down his sword,
refusing to kill.  He walks away.

The arena explodes in cheers -- a chant of "Maximus the
Merciful" grows to deafening proportions.

Suddenly the arena is filled with Praetorians -- they
block Maximus' exit from the arena -- the crowd boos --
horrified --

The Praetorians surround Maximus.  He is unarmed, but
coils for the inevitable battle.

Then the Praetorians part...

And Commodus walks through them.  He carries something
wrapped in a rich cloth.  Maximus glares at him.

The Praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly.
The Emperor and the Gladiator, at last.

Maximus and Commodus stare at each other.  The crowd
cannot hear what is said, but strain to observe this
incredible confrontation.

					COMMODUS
		Brother... we've taken a sad path
		since we were children at Capri,
		have we not?

Maximus doesn't answer.

					COMMODUS
		For my own part... I am sorry it
		came to this.  And to you alone of
		all men, I acknowledge my errors.
		And my regret.  I shall live with my
		sin for all my days.

					MAXIMUS
		As will I, Commodus.  As will I.

Commodus unwraps the cloth bundle.  Inside is a small
wooden sword.  He holds it up so the crowd can see.

A collective gasp.  The wooden sword, prized by all
gladiators above all else.  Freedom.

					COMMODUS
		As the first act of my contrition I
		offer you the wooden sword of
		freedom.

He holds out the wooden sword.  A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Take it, brother.  Stand at my side
		as a free man worthy of your
		ancestors.

					MAXIMUS
		I only have ancestors because of
		you, brother.  You killed everything
		that ever lived alongside me.

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Take it, Maximus.  Let us heal that
		fatal wound together.

					MAXIMUS
		This is the new home you cursed me
		to.  And I am safer here from your
		treachery than I could ever be
		outside.

					COMMODUS
		Will you always mistrust me?

					MAXIMUS
		Why don't you ask your father that?

Commodus visibly flinches at that, but still holds the
wooden sword out.  The crowd is breathless.

					MAXIMUS
		I have more power as a slave in the
		arena than I could ever have as a
		free man.  As the Colosseum goes,
		the people go.  As the people go,
		the Empire goes.

					COMMODUS
			(tense)
		You think this is power?  I could
		show you power, slave --

					MAXIMUS
		No, Caesar... I will show you.

With that, Maximus does the unimaginable.  He simply turns
his back on the Emperor and walks away.

And the crowd goes mad.  They cheer the defiant gladiator,
their champion.

And, equally, they deride the Emperor.  They mock him by
holding out food and trash like Commodus is holding out
the wooden sword.  They laugh and jeer.

Commodus glances around at his children, lost.

Then he turns to the Imperial Box.  He sees Lucilla
slipping out the back of the box.  He watches her go.

And the crowd continues to jeer.

EXT.  STREET THEATER - NIGHT

The crowd laughs riotously as Roman Actors perform a
typically ribald comedy in a secluded street:

An outrageously dressed version of Maximus is parading
around on an outrageously dressed version of Commodus,
riding him like a donkey and slapping his rear with a
wooden sword.  The "Commodus" actor mews and brays and
wails like an infant.

Captain Marcellus of the City Guard gallops past them, on
his way out of Rome.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - DAY

Maximus stands with Juba and Vibius.  He draws a circle in
the sand with a stick.  He draws a line to the circle.

					MAXIMUS
		The Felix Regiment will come from
		here.  We'll face the body of the
		Praetorians outside -- here.  Once
		inside, my archers will take up
		position to counter opposition
		inside the Colosseum.  I'll enter
		and join you -- we'll attack here --

Maximus draws a line to the Imperial Box.

					MAXIMUS
		-- a covert assault from within.

					VIBIUS
		We'll be killed.

					MAXIMUS
		Probably.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		But if we aren't... think of the
		glory.  Do you remember glory,
		Gladiator?

					JUBA
		And if we die that day -- we die
		free men worthy of our ancestors.

					VIBIUS
		You didn't know my ancestors.  A
		rotten bunch.

Maximus points to the huge statue of Mars.

					MAXIMUS
		Then be worthy of him.  The old
		Titan who would rather die bravely
		in a just battle than slink off to
		grow old and fat.

					JUBA
		And impotent.

A beat.  Vibius thinks about it.

					VIBIUS
		If I die, I want a hundred whores at
		my funeral.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - EVENING

Commodus sweeps in.  Thinks Lucilla is standing there.
The woman turns, it is Lucilla's Handmaiden.

					COMMODUS
		Where is my sister?

					HANDMAIDEN
		She's out, sir...

					COMMODUS
		Where?

					HANDMAIDEN
		I... don't know, Caesar.

Commodus looks at her for a moment.

And then he slowly walks right to her.  His face an inch
away from hers.

					COMMODUS
		Where is my sister?

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo sits, considering Maximus.

					MAXIMUS
		Was it Centurion...?  General...?

					PROXIMO
		Captain.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		How did you know?

					MAXIMUS
		A soldier knows a soldier.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		All that was a long time ago.  Too
		much wine and too many women.  And
		too much money.

					MAXIMUS
		No --

					PROXIMO
		This is who I am...
			(he pats his ample
			belly)
		You see?  There was a time I would
		stand against ten men and never give
		an inch, spitting into the jaws of
		Hades all the while.  There was a
		time my heart swelled to strap on
		the armor of Rome.  But now...

Something flashes across Proximo's eyes, something like
tragedy.

					PROXIMO
		Now I am just an entertainer.

A pause.

					MAXIMUS
		You said something to me once.  You
		said in this life, we all die.  All
		we can choose is how we die.  And
		how we are remembered.  Do you
		recall those words?

					PROXIMO
		Yes.

					MAXIMUS
		Then be remembered proudly.  This is
		your time, Proximo.  Stand at my
		side and be what you were.  What you
		truly are.  One last time.

A beat.

Proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically --
Maximus is a bit taken aback -- Proximo dramatically
flicks tears from his eyes -- and then can't keep the show
up -- he bursts into laughter.

Maximus stares at him.

					PROXIMO
			(laughing)
		You might have spared yourself the
		speech, General.  The lady Lucilla
		bought all my gladiators two hours
		ago!

					MAXIMUS
		You pox-ridden bastard -- !   

					PROXIMO
		I am the richest trainer in the
		Empire!  And I will let my
		gladiators do anything you like!
		Conspire away, General!

Maximus can only laugh as well.

					PROXIMO
		But I tell you -- if you survive
		this madness I want you to go into
		business with me.  I'll give you a
		quarter of my holdings.

					MAXIMUS
			(standing)
		A quarter?!

					PROXIMO
		A third.  And not a hair more.  And
		you'll have to start in the
		provinces!  Cleaning up the lion
		shit!

					MAXIMUS
		You know, if you were half so awful
		as you pretend, you'd be a
		terrifying man.

Maximus shakes his head, smiling, and goes.

Proximo sits for a moment.

Then he rises and goes to a heavy chest.  He looks at the
chest for a moment and then opens it.

Inside is his old Lorica Segmentata.  He gazes at his
armor, considering what he once was.  And what he now is.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus enters.  Lucilla is waiting, extremely tense.

					MAXIMUS
		Lucilla --

					LUCILLA
		Don't even say it.  I know it's
		dangerous -- but I had to see you.
		Captain Marcellus has gone to the
		army with your message as you
		instructed.

					MAXIMUS
		Good.

					LUCILLA
		He says the City Guard will be ready
		at the south road at noon.  They can
		only wait for an hour so --

					MAXIMUS
		You've told me this already.

					LUCILLA
		Did I?  All right then.  So
		everything is prepared.  The Senate
		will be in attendance and you have
		your gladiators -- the usual cohort
		of Praetorians will be inside the
		arena --

					MAXIMUS
		Lucilla... why are you here?

A pause.

					LUCILLA
		Tell me honestly... please... do you
		think it will work?

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		No.

					LUCILLA
		Do you think we'll all die?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

She leans against a wall.

A pause.

					LUCILLA
		Will you swear something to me?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					LUCILLA
		Will you swear it on the memory of
		your son?

A long beat.

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					LUCILLA
		By all that you have ever loved...
		swear that if you survive you will
		take my son out of Rome.  Swear that
		you will go far away and never
		return.

He steps to her.

					MAXIMUS
			(deeply)
		I will.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		And if I should not survive... swear
		to me that you will honor my family
		in your prayers always.

					LUCILLA
		I will.

A long, difficult beat.  She fights back tears.

					LUCILLA
		Had I not been the daughter of
		Rome...

He puts a gentle finger to her lips.

					MAXIMUS
		Shhh... my heart breaks enough.

He holds her closely, tenderly.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Lucilla enters, deep in thought, still drained from her
meeting with Maximus.

She suddenly stops.  Frozen.

Commodus is sitting across the chamber, Lucius at his
knee.  An open scroll on Commodus' lap.

					COMMODUS
		Sister... join us.  I've been
		reading to dear Lucius.

					LUCIUS
		I've been reading too.

					COMMODUS
		Yes, he's a very smart little boy.
		He'll make a grand Emperor one day.

Lucilla has not moved.

					COMMODUS
		Join us, sister.

Lucilla goes to them, sits.

					COMMODUS
		We've been reading about the great
		Julius and his adventures in Egypt.

					LUCIUS
		She killed herself with a snake!

					COMMODUS
			(to Lucius)
		And just wait until you hear what
		happened to some of our other
		ancestors!  If you're very good,
		tomorrow night I'll tell you the
		story of Emperor Claudius.  He was
		betrayed!  By those closest to
		him...
			(he glances up to
			Lucilla)
		... by his own blood... they
		whispered in dark corners and went
		out late at night and conspired and
		conspired...

Lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill.

Lucius is busy scanning the scroll.  Commodus gently
strokes his hair, his cold eyes never leaving Lucilla's.

					COMMODUS
		But the Emperor Claudius knew that
		they were up to something dire.  He
		knew they were busy little bees.
		And one night he sat down with one
		of them and he looked at her and he
		said:  "Tell me what you have been
		doing, busy little bee, or I shall
		strike down those dearest to you.
		You shall watch as I bathe in their
		blood."  And the bee knew he spoke
		the truth, for the Emperor always
		speaks the truth.  And what do you
		think happened then, Lucius?

					LUCIUS
			(still pouring over
			the scrolls)
		I don't know, Uncle.

					COMMODUS
			(glaring at Lucilla)
		The bee told him everything.

Lucilla's face is tortured.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo is asleep -- a sound outside wakes him -- the
steady clip-clop of horses on stone.  A lot of horses.

He rises and goes to a window overlooking the street
outside.

A stern Praetorian Guard cavalry unit is cantering into
position at his gates.  Proximo grabs his clothes --

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

With cool military precision the Praetorians take up
position at the gates before Proximo's compound, an
unassailable line.  They quickly prepare their bows.

Meanwhile, another Praetorian unit has taken up position
at the other end of Proximo's compound -- sealing that
entrance as well.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Proximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the
first flaming arrow arches into the compound -- it is
followed by hundreds more --

The Praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a
ceaseless hail of flaming arrows -- everything begins to
burn -- the caged gladiators are stirring now --
shouting --

Proximo races to his panicked guards --

					PROXIMO
		Release them!  Release them all!
		ARM THEM!

The guards sprint to the cells -- unlocking the gladiators
as quickly as they can --

Not quick enough for many -- Praetorians are now pouring
pitch through the gutter that runs along the bottom of the
cells -- igniting it and incinerating all those trapped
inside --

The compound is soon a raging inferno --

Proximo releases Maximus and Juba --

					PROXIMO
		Come --

					MAXIMUS
		But --

					PROXIMO
		If you want to live -- follow me --

					VIBIUS
			(calling to them)
		Go, Spaniard!  We'll show these
		Roman dogs how gladiators fight!   

Proximo hauls Maximus and Juba off as Vibius and the other
gladiators arm themselves --

INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT

Proximo is leading Maximus and Juba quickly through a
decaying cramped tunnel.

					PROXIMO
		All the old gladiator schools have
		tunnels to the Colosseum -- most
		have long since collapsed --

					JUBA
		How did they know?

					MAXIMUS
		We were betrayed.

					JUBA
			(stops)
		I'll stay here.  In case they
		follow.

Maximus stops as well.

					JUBA
		Go!  Bring us the army!

Maximus nods.

					PROXIMO
		Quickly --

He leads Maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of
tunnels --

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Vibius hoped to die fighting -- he never got the chance.

It is not a battle, it is a slaughter.

The Praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching
the gates -- all the walls are covered -- most of the
gladiators die in the hellish inferno -- the relentless
rain of flaming arrows continues --

Vibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to
fight -- Praetorian snipers cut him down -- he dies
reaching for the statue of Mars.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - SUBTERRANEAN - NIGHT

Proximo and Maximus emerge deep in the bowels of the
Colosseum.

					PROXIMO
			(points)
		Down that corridor is the butchery
		-- the blood sloughs lead to the
		Tiber.  Gods watch over you.

					MAXIMUS
		You're not coming?

					PROXIMO
		They are killing my men!

He races back into the tunnel.

Maximus moves quickly down the corridor.  He can finally
see...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - BUTCHERY - NIGHT

Grisly carcasses of every description hang from hooks.
Two bored butchers hack them up.  The good bits are tossed
into a wagon to fed to the Colosseum animals.  The waste
and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening.  A
butcher occasionally lifts a sluice-gate and a gush of
water flows into the sewer from above, washing down the
blood and carcasses.

Maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of
hanging carcasses and flies.

When the butchers are looking elsewhere, Maximus creeps to
the sewer opening and climbs in -- he immediately slides
down for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood
sluice -- out of sight --

Then he thuds to a stop.  He can go no further because the
remains of an animal carcass blocks his way.  He tries to
slither past the carcass --

Finally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice-gate
and a torrent of water flows down.

Maximus is washed down the hideous sewer.

INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT

Proximo and Juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel
toward the compound -- they are very close now -- the roar
of flame is heard -- the creak of falling timber -- and
the screams of burning men.  They run.

They round a corner and see there is no way past the world
of flame ahead of them.  The tunnel to the compound has
collapsed.

					PROXIMO
		Gods... they're killing them all.

Proximo leads them up a cramped stairway to...

EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

They emerge through a sewer entrance -- right into the
arms of the Praetorian Guard.  Proximo and Juba are bound.
Proximo sees his compound burning.  Sees the Praetorian
archers taking out any last survivors.  Hears the screams.

INT./ EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - ARREST MONTAGE - NIGHT

A quick sequence of brutal arrests as Praetorian Guard
units round up many associated with the plot.  And many
that are not.

GAIUS' BEDROOM:  Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and
hauled out.

CHRISTIAN HOME:  A congregation of Christians is chained
together, their secret altar smashed.

CAFE:  Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls.

STREET THEATER:  Actors are dragged off in the midst of a
performance.

GRACCHUS' STEAM ROOM:  Gracchus is enjoying grapes with
his handsome catamite.  A unit of Praetorian bursts in.
Gracchus looks at them.  Sighs.

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Commodus stands with Lucius on a balcony overlooking the
city.

The roaring flames of the fire at Proximo's compound can
easily be seen.

					LUCIUS
		What is that fire?

					COMMODUS
		Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.  I
		arranged it just for you.

He puts his hand on the boy's shoulder.

Behind them, Lucilla sits slumped in a chair.  Her face is
a mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do.

Two Praetorians enter with a bucket.

					PRAETORIAN
		Caesar...

Commodus goes to them.  He talks quietly with them for a
moment and glances at what they are carrying.

					COMMODUS
		Oh... that's for my sister.

They bring the bucket to Lucilla and set it before her.

Commodus ignores her and goes back to Lucius on the
balcony.

Lucilla glances inside the bucket...

Captain Marcellus' head is floating in brine.  Lucilla
moans.  All is lost.

EXT.  TIBER RIVER - NIGHT

Maximus splashes to the surface of the filthy Tiber,
gasping for air.

Animal carcasses float up next to him.  He grabs onto one
and floats down the gently flowing river.

EXT.  ITALIAN FRONT - CAMP - DAWN

The Wolf of Rome sleeps.  Then its ears rise.  Then its
head.  It sniffs the air.  The wolf slowly rises and
begins loping through the camp.

It passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily
drifting up from campfires.

The wolf finally stops and looks up.

Maximus is on a horse.  He climbs down.  The wolf goes to
him and licks his hand.

Maximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his
side.  Soldiers stir, amazed to see their General is
alive.

Gallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to Maximus.  They
continue to march through the camp, more and more
astonished soldiers joining them.

They march toward the large tents at the center of the
encampment.

Titus emerges from his tent.  Slams to a stop --

					TITUS
		By all the Gods...

He goes to Maximus and embraces him.

					MAXIMUS
		Old friend...

					TITUS
		You're returned from Hades!  By all
		the Gods!

					MAXIMUS
		Where is he?

Just then Quintus emerges from the largest tent.  He
stares at Maximus, unbelieving.

A long beat as they look at each other.

Quintus knows his destiny.  With quiet dignity he begins
whispering a prayer.  Maximus moves to him, embracing him:

					MAXIMUS
		I forgive you.

He stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him.
Quintus falls.

A beat.

Titus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of
office from his uniform.  He hands it to Maximus.

An enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment.

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - MORNING

A castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration.
Their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate
around Commodus' bedroom.

The Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe.  His
body slaves work over him closely.

He is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the
slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him.

The castrati hymn continues...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE COLOSSEUM - DAY

The hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the
Colosseum...

It seems that all of Rome is here for this great day.
Huge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward
the Colosseum entrances.  Vendors are doing brisk
business.  Praetorian units in full dress uniform canter
past.

We elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the
Colosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena
stands...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

The hymn is all we hear as we see...   

The stands are filling.  We see the rich and poor alike.
We see the orator Cassius.  We see Senator Falco and most
of the Senate.  We see the cohort of fifty Praetorian
taking up position around the Imperial Box.

A golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now
extends about twenty feet from the Imperial Box to a spot
over the arena.

We float down the stairs and then we see the arena
itself...

It is stunning in its simplicity.

The days victims are tied to posts in the center of the
arena.  Suspended above them is an enormous cloud.  A
thick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a
threatening rain cloud.

We see Proximo and Juba.  We see Senators Gracchus and
Gaius.  We see Gaius' wife and Gracchus catamite and
Christian families and scholars and actors.

Seven stylized hills surround them.

The hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the
damned.

TIME CUT:

Later.  By now, the Colosseum is packed.  All fifty-five
thousand seats are taken.  Another ten thousand stand
wherever they can.  A feral anticipation buzzes through
the crowd.

Outside the Colosseum, the streets are crowded with
thousands more who couldn't get in.

Trumpets blare.

Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards stride into the
Imperial Box.

Then Commodus enters.  He is shrouded in a full lion's
skin, the head of the lion concealing his own.  His head
is down, he does not look up.

Lucilla and Lucius enter after him and sit.  Lucilla's
face is drained, her eyes defeated.  Lucius is wearing a
miniature set of Lorica Segmentata, complete with
ceremonial dagger.

EXT.  ROMAN STREET - DAY

A mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the
outskirts of Rome.  The street is deserted.  It seems that
almost everyone is at the Colosseum.

The dog stops.  Looks up.

Then a sound is heard.  The steady cadence of horses'
hooves.

The Felix Regiment rounds a corner.  Maximus leads the
cavalry.  He wears Lorica Segmentata.  His corps of
archers and soldiers follow.  They troop down the dusty
street.

Maximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog.

QUICK CUTS:

The Felix Regiment moves through the streets.  The few
pedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around
corners.  The roar of the Colosseum can be heard far in
the distance...

Arrows slice into isolated Praetorian sentries.  The Felix
Regiment continues its stealth invasion...

Finally, Maximus reins his horse and his troops stop.

The mounted City Guard are waiting.

Without a word, the City Guard joins Maximus and the two
combined forces continue their inexorable march to the
Colosseum.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down,
slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the
Imperial Box.

The crowd grows hushed.

Commodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a
moment.  Then he dramatically flings off the lion skin.

The crowd gasps.

He is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in
gold.  His eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks
around at his people.

He finally speaks:

					COMMODUS
			(serene)
		Rome... This is the day that was
		foretold.  This is the day when your
		father takes away all fear...
			(he holds up his
			hands)
		With these hands I shall destroy
		your enemies so that you may sleep
		always and forever in peace.  From
		this day forth let it be known that
		I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,
		have surmounted mortality.  That I,
		Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,
		assume my destined place... at the
		side of the Gods.

The crowd is stunned.  A few scattered laughs.

Lucilla stares at him, disbelieving.

					COMMODUS
		And as a righteous God, I shall ever
		protect you.  I shall cradle the
		world on my benevolent hands and
		clasp it to my heart.  So I have
		spoken!  And let the heavens tremble
		at my might!

EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - DAY

Maximus continues to lead the combined Felix Regiment and
City Guard cavalry through the streets.  The roaring is
closer now.  They are nearing the Colosseum, they can just
glimpse the edge of the top tier over some building.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus continues:

					COMMODUS
		This day I reclaim Rome for her
		people.  I shall give you the
		rebirth of your Empire!  Reborn and
		cleansed of her enemies!

He raises his arms.  At his cue the Praetorian archers
raise their bows, ready, aiming at the victims.

					COMMODUS
		I will make a new Rome!  Founded as
		it was at the beginning!  Archers --
		GIVE US BLOOD!

The Praetorians suddenly point their bows higher and
fire --

They shoot the cloud -- the bladder EXPLODES and thick
blood rains down on the victims -- the blood splashes over
them, coating them.

EXT.  OUTSIDE COLOSSEUM - DAY

The roar from the Colosseum is now deafening as Maximus
and the City Guard round the final corner -- the Colosseum
is before them -- the massive Praetorian Guard force is
caught of guard -- with crisp military efficiency the
Felix Regiment and the City Guard quickly canter into
place, an unbroken line of seasoned warriors facing the
Praetorians.

The huge mob outside the Colosseum is confused, intrigued,
watching the face-off.  The mounted archers of the Felix
Regiment have drawn their bows.

Maximus looks down from his horse at a Praetorian Officer.

					MAXIMUS
		Throw down your weapons or we will
		kill you.

A beat.

The Praetorian Officer glances at the formidable force
against him.  He drops his sword.  His men follow suit.

					MAXIMUS
			(he turns to his men)
		FELIX REGIMENT!  DO HONOR TO YOUR
		ANCESTORS!  I SALUTE YOU!

He spurs his horse and the Felix Regiment roars, springing
into action -- they gallop through the crowd and to the
Colosseum -- meanwhile the City Guard disarm and guard the
Praetorian --

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus continues:

					COMMODUS
		As it was at the beginning so is it
		now.  The great She-Wolf of Rome
		will again suckle us, again ravage
		our enemies -- AND BRING US A WORLD
		REBORN!

At his cue, two elevator platforms rumble into view,
rising from the bowels of the Colosseum to the arena sand.

On each platform is a cage full of ferocious wolves, they
snap and growl, straining to be released.

					COMMODUS
		So it was for Romulus and Remus,
		sons of Mars, so shall it be for us!
		The great She-Wolf will --

Suddenly -- the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open
and Maximus leads the Felix Regiment cavalry thundering
into the arena.

The crowd is stunned -- Commodus is stunned -- Lucilla
bolts up --

Commodus immediately spins to Lucilla, his eyes burning --

His Praetorian are momentarily confused --

At Gallus' command the Felix Regiment archers let fly --
multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the
Praetorians -- some confusing skirmishes as the remaining
Praetorians fire back --

Maximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the
prisoners free --

Meanwhile, Commodus strides back down the platform toward
Lucilla in the Imperial Box, murder in his eyes --

She suddenly hugs Lucius quickly and kisses him --

					LUCILLA
		Remember your mother.

She pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform
and pushes him to his attendant -- his attendant pulls him
away as --

Lucilla spins to Commodus -- he grabs her into an embrace
-- he turns the knife on her -- thrusting deeply as he
kisses her --

A long kiss as he holds her tightly to him.  Then he
gently sits her down on her throne.  Her eyes wide, dying.

One of Commodus' Body Guards grabs him:

					CENTURION BODY GUARD
		Caesar -- we must go -- !

Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards begin hustling him out
of the Imperial Box --

					COMMODUS
		GET THE BOY!

He grabs Lucius from his attendant and drags him off --

They try to escape out the back of the Imperial Box -- but
Felix Regiment troops are blocking their way -- racing up
toward them --

					CENTURION BODY GUARD
		THIS WAY, CAESAR!

Below, through the confusion, Maximus sees Commodus
escaping with Lucius down through a side tunnel.

Maximus cuts Juba and Proximo free.  Juba immediately
snatches up a sword.  Maximus quickly offers a sword to
Proximo.

					MAXIMUS
		Captain?

Proximo takes the sword.

					MAXIMUS
			(re: Commodus and
			the others)
		Where are they going?!

					PROXIMO
		This way!

They race across the arena and into a tunnel...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - BOWELS - DAY

Proximo leads them through a series of catacombs -- damp
tunnels shoot off in every direction -- everywhere around
them the heavy machinery of the games rise like mammoth
creatures to the arena above -- a baroque network of ropes
and pulleys and counterweights and elevator platforms and
air shafts and blood sewers -- And they suddenly run
directly into Commodus, dragging Lucius, and his six
Centurions coming the other direction.

The final battle begins with no preamble --

Maximus launches himself forward -- instantly separating
Commodus and Lucius -- he slams at Commodus with his sword
-- Commodus slams back --

Proximo and Juba race into the six Centurions -- a wild
free-for-all as they prove their worth as warriors -- Juba
fights with his usual elegant precision -- Proximo fights
as a man reborn, alive again --

Proximo takes cagey advantage of his knowledge of this
subterranean world -- spinning around machinery and
leaping over blood sewers and swinging heavy
counterweights --

Maximus and Commodus hack at each other with all the fiery
passion in them -- Commodus is a perfect match for Maximus
and equally ruthless -- their swords thrust and parry and
slice at amazing speed -- one false move, one mistake,
means death --

Meanwhile, the battle is turning into a victory for Juba
and Proximo -- they are defeating the Centurions --
Commodus sees this -- and sees Lucius crying in a
corner --

He screams to one of his remaining Centurions:

					COMMODUS
		KILL THE BOY!

Maximus whirls to Lucius -- Commodus attacks -- slashing
Maximus' shoulders -- Maximus sees Proximo racing to try
and save Lucius as he spins back to battle Commodus --

A Centurion raises his sword to kill Lucius -- Juba kills
his final opponent, turns -- Proximo just manages to push
Lucius out of the way -- the Centurion's sword slices into
him --

Juba flings his sword across the room -- the final
Centurion falls --

Maximus sees Proximo collapse to a wall -- dying --
Proximo locks eyes with Maximus as he slides down the
wall.  The old pirate shrugs.  And is dead.

Juba races to Lucius and holds the boy, turning his face
away from the slaughter --

Maximus, his furious passion redoubled at Proximo's death,
attacks Commodus with every ounce of strength in him --

Commodus' eyes begin to flash with something we have never
seen before, fear.

Maximus strikes mercilessly -- forcing Commodus steadily
back until they are fighting atop one of the elevator
platforms to the arena above.

					MAXIMUS
		For my wife!

Maximus strike hard -- Commodus barely blocks the blow --

					MAXIMUS
		For my son!

He strikes harder -- Commodus is losing --

					MAXIMUS
		For my father!

He strikes with everything he's got -- slashing Commodus
-- Commodus sails back -- his sword falling --

Maximus stands over him.  Glaring.  Commodus is panting,
defeated, glaring up at him.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		We who are about to die salute you.

Maximus raises his sword high -- Commodus raises an arm --
Maximus SMASHES the sword down -- and Commodus is dead.

A moment as Maximus stands over Commodus.  Then he looks
at the series of counterweight ropes around the elevator
platform.

He slices through one of the ropes and the platform begins
to rise...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

A trap door springs open and the elevator platform rises
to the sand of the arena.  Maximus stands above the dead
Emperor.

The crowd stares in amazement -- and then begins to cheer
in joy at the return of their hero.  A chant begins...
"Maximus the Merciful... Maximus the Merciful... Maximus
the Merciful..." which then grows to a refrain of
"Caesar... Caesar... Caesar..."

Maximus ignores them, his eyes drawn to one sight:
Lucilla.

He goes to the steps of the platform leading to the
Imperial Box.  He slowly climbs the steps.

In the Imperial Box, Senator Gracchus is standing.  So too
Juba and others.

Lucius is kneeling by his mother, holding her hand, his
head down.  Lucilla is dead.  Lucius mourns with quiet
dignity.

Maximus looks at Lucilla and kneels.  He takes her other
hand.  A long moment.  He looks at Lucius.

Then he slowly bends forward and kisses Lucilla deeply,
the ritual farewell.

He stands.

Senator Gracchus steps to him:

					GRACCHUS
		General, the purple is yours if you
		so desire.  The Senate will support
		you.

Maximus looks at him.  And then at the people.  The chant
of "Caesar... Caesar... Caesar..." is like a powerful
beating heart.

Maximus moves to the edge of the Imperial Box to address
the people.  The crowd grows silent.

Maximus looks around at the blood of the arena.

					MAXIMUS
		Rome... you are better than this.
		Look inside yourselves.  I challenge
		you to find your true voice.  Help
		the Senate speak for you.  Make them
		your champion... And dare to think
		what could be.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		I give you back the dream.

With that he slowly turns and walks down the steps to the
arena sand.  The crowd is absolutely silent.

He goes to Titus:

					MAXIMUS
		When everything has calmed down,
		lead an orderly withdrawal.  Take
		them home.

Titus salutes.

Maximus return the salute and then leaps onto his horse.
As he canters toward the exit he turns for one final look
at Lucilla.

He sees that Lucius is now at the foot of the stairs, on
the arena sand, gazing at him.

Maximus stops his horse.

He canters back to Lucius.  The boy looks up at him.  A
moment between them.

Lucius thrusts up his hand.  Maximus grabs his hand and
swings him onto the horse behind him.

A look to Juba.  Juba bows his head with respect.
Farewell.

Maximus spins the horse around and begins cantering out of
the Colosseum.

Juba disappears into the crowd.

Maximus and Lucius canter across the arena and through the
huge doors...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

From high above we see Maximus and Lucius riding out of
the Colosseum and disappearing into the streets of Rome.

								FADE TO:

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAWN

Maximus stands with Lucius at his old vineyard.

It is still scorched and dead, weeds overgrowing the
vineyards, the house ruined.

Maximus puts a hand on the boy's shoulder, this boy so
like his own son.

					MAXIMUS
		It doesn't look it now... but soon
		we'll have it growing again... Next
		year there will be vines, and then
		there will be grapes... It will be
		alive.

We leave them, dreaming of the future.

								FADE OUT.

SCENE ONE

A booth at a Chinese restaurant, Williamson and Levene are
seated at the booth.

            All that I'm saying, things get

            ...you didn't close...

            Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I
            pray in your life you will never
            find it runs in streaks.  That's
            what it does, that's all it's doing.
            Streaks.  I pray it misses you.
            That's all I want to say.

                         WILLIAMSON
                   (pause)
            What about the other two?

            What two?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Four.  You had four leads.  One
            kicked out, one the judge, you say...

                         LEVENE
            ...you want to see the court

            Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April,
            September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't
            fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an
            order taker, John.  He talks, he
            talks a good game, look at the
            board, and it's me, John, it's me...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Not lately it isn't.

                         LEVENE
            Lately kiss my ass lately.  That
            isn't how you build an org...talk,
            talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch.
            When we were on Peterson, who paid
            for his fucking car?  You talk to
            him.  The Seville...?  He came in,
            "You bought that for me Shelly."
            Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing.
            Sixty-five, when we were there,
            with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em
            downtown.  What was that?  Luck?
            That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John.
            You're burning my ass, I can't get
            a fucking lead...you think that was
            luck.  My stats for those years?
            Bullshit...over that period of
            time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck.
            It was skill.  You want to throw
            that away, John...?  You want to
            throw that away?

                         WILLIAMSON
            It isn't me...

                                                            4.

            ...it isn't you...?  Who is it?
            Who is this I'm talking to?  I need
            the leads...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...after the thirtieth...

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get
            on the board the thirtieth, they're
            going to can my ass.  I need the
            leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm
            gone, and you're going to miss me,
            John, I swear to you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Murray...

                         LEVENE
            ...you talk to Murray...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I have.  And my job is to marshal
            those leads...

                         LEVENE
            Marshal the leads...marshal the
            leads?  What the fuck, what bus did
            you get off of, we're here to
            fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the
            leads.  What the fuck talk is that?
            What the fuck talk is that?  Where
            did you learn that?  In school?
                   (pause)
            That's "talk," my friend, that's
            "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm
            the man to sell.  I'm getting
            garbage.
                   (pause)
            You're giving it to me, and what
            I'm saying is it's fucked.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You're saying that I'm fucked.

                         LEVENE
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Let me...

                                                            5.


                         LEVENE
            ...and I'm going to get bounced and

            ...let me...are you listening to
            me...?

                         LEVENE
            Yes.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Let me tell you something, Shelly.
            I do what I'm hired to do.
            I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to
            watch the leads.  I'm given...hold
            on, I'm given a policy.  My job is
            to do that.  What I'm told.  That's
            it.  You, wait a second, anybody
            falls below a certain mark I'm not
            permitted to give them the premium
            leads.

                         LEVENE
            Then how do they come up above that
            mark?  With dreck...?  That's
            nonsense.  Explain this to me.
            'Cause it's a waste, and it's a
            stupid waste.  I want to tell you
            something...

                         WILLIAMSON
            You know what those leads cost?

                         LEVENE
            The premium leads.  Yes.  I know
            what they cost.  John.  Because I,
            I generated the dollar revenue
            sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen
            senny-nine, you know what I made?
            Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand
            dollars.  John?  For Murray... For
            Mitch...look at the sheets...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Murray said...

                         LEVENE
            Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You
            know?  You tell him I said so.
            What does he fucking know?  He's
            going to have a "sales"
            contest...you know what our sales
            contest used to be?

            Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on
            the ground.  Murray?  When was the
            last time he went out on a sit?
            Sales contest?  It's laughable.
            It's cold out there now, John.
            It's tight.  Money is tight.  This
            ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It
            just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a

            Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me:
            the hot leads...

            That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You
            don't look at the fucking percentage.
            You look at the gross.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Either way.  You're out.

                         LEVENE
            I'm out.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Yes.

            I've seen those leads.  I saw them
            when I was at Homestead, we pitched
            those cocksuckers Rio Rancho
            nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't
            buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking
            toaster.  They're broke, John.
            They're cold.  They're deadbeats,
            you can't judge on that.  Even so.
            Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine.
            Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING
            LEADS they got their money in a
            sock.  They're fucking Polacks,
            John.  Four leads.  I close two.
            Two.  Fifty per...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...they kicked out.

                         LEVENE
            They all kick out.  You run in
            streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm...
            I'm...don't look at the board, look
            at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone.
            Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at
            Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff.
            You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT.
            I got to get on the fucking board.
            Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who
            ever picked up a check I was flush.
            Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch
            himself...Those guys lived on the
            business I brought in.  They lived
            on it...and so did Murray, John.
            You were here you'd of benefited
            from it too.  And now I'm saying
            this.  Do I want charity?  Do I
            want pity?  I want sits.  I want
            leads that don't come right out of
            a phone book.  Give me a lead
            hotter than that, I'll go in and
            close it.  Give me a chance.
            That's all I want.  I'm going to
            get up on that fucking board and
            all I want is a chance.  It's a
            streak and I'm going to turn it
            around.
                   (pause)
            I need your help.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't do it, Shelly.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            The leads are assigned randomly...

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit, bullshit, you assign
            them... What are you telling me?

            contest board.

                         LEVENE
            Then put me on the board.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You start closing again, you'll be
            on the board.

                         LEVENE
            I can't close these leads, John.
            No one can.  It's a joke.  John,
            look, just give me a hot lead.
            Just give me two of the premium
            leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a
            "test" and I promise you...

            What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked.
            You see...?  Then it's my job.
            That's what I'm telling you.

                         LEVENE
            I will close.  John, John, ten

            Listen.  I want to talk to you.
            Permit me to do this a second.  I'm
            older than you.  A man acquires a
            reputation.  On the street.  What
            he does when he's up, what he does
            otherwise...I said "ten," you said
            "no." You said "twenty." I said
            "fine," I'm not going to fuck with
            you, how can I beat that, you tell
            me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay.
            Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty
            percent, and fifty bucks a lead.
            That's fine.  For now.  That's fine.
            A month or two we'll talk.  A month
            from now.  Next month.  After the
            thirtieth.

            We'll talk.

            What are we going to say?

                         LEVENE
            No.  You're right.  That's for
            later.  We'll talk in a month.
            What have you got?  I want two sits.
            Tonight.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I'm not sure I have two.

                         LEVENE

            Bullshit.  They ain't been in the
            office yet.  Give 'em some stiff.
            We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two
            sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of
            'em, six and ten, you can do
            it...six and ten...eight and
            eleven, I don't give a shit, you
            set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits
            in Des Plaines.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Alright.

                         LEVENE
            Good.  Now we're talking.

                         LEVENE
            Ah, shit, John.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I wish I could.

                         LEVENE
            You fucking asshole.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it, John.
                   (pause)
            I'll pay you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
            I'm coming in here with the sales,
            I'll pay you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it, when I pay, the
            gas...I get back the hotel, I'll
            bring it in tomorrow.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Can't do it.

                         LEVENE
            I'll give you thirty on them now,
            I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've
            got it at the hotel.
                   (pause)
            John?
                   (pause)
            We do that, for chrissake?

                         WILLIAMSON
            No.

                         LEVENE
            I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?
                   (pause)
            John.
                   (long pause)
            John: my daughter...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't do it, Shelly...

                                                           12.


                         LEVENE
            Well, I want to tell you something,
            fella, wasn't long I could pick up
            the phone, call Murray and I'd have
            your job.  You know that?  Not too
            long ago.  For what?  For nothing.
            "Mur, this new kid burns my ass."
            "Shelly, he's out." You're gone
            before I'm back from lunch.  I
            bought him a trip to Bermuda once...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I have to go...
                   (gets up)


                         LEVENE
            Wait.  Alright.  Fine.
                   (starts going in
                   pocket for money)
            The one.  Give me the lead.  Give
            me the one lead.  The best one you
            have.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't split them.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Because I say so.

                         LEVENE
                   (pause)
            Is that it?  Is that it?  You want
            to do business that way...?

Williamson gets up, leaves money on the table.

                         LEVENE
            You want to do business that way...?
            Alright.  Alright.  Alright.
            Alright.  What is there on the
            other list...?

                         WILLIAMSON
            You want something off the B list?

                         LEVENE
            Yeah.  Yeah.

                                                           13.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Is that what you're saying?

                         LEVENE
            That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.
                   (pause)
            I'd like something off the other
            list.  Which, very least, that I'm
            entitled to.  If I'm still working
            here, which for the moment I guess
            that I am.
                   (pause)
            What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to
            you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            That's alright.

                         LEVENE
            The deal still stands, our other
            thing.

Williamson shrugs.  Starts out of the booth.

                         LEVENE
            Good.  Mmm.  I, you know, I left my
            wallet back at the hotel.

SCENE TWO

A booth at the restaurant.  Moss and Aaronow seated.  After
the meal.

                         MOSS
            Polacks and deadbeats.

                         AARONOW
            ...Polacks...

                         MOSS
            Deadbeats all.

                         AARONOW
            ...they hold on to their money...

                         MOSS
            All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens
            to us all.

                         AARONOW
            Where am I going to work?

                                                           14.


                         MOSS
            You have to cheer up, George, you
            aren't out yet.

                         AARONOW
            I'm not?

                         MOSS
            You missed a fucking sale.  Big
            deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal.
            How you going to sell 'em in the
            first place...?  Your mistake, you
            shoun'a took the lead.

                         AARONOW
            I had to.

                         MOSS
            You had to, yeah.  Why?

                         AARONOW
            To get on the...

                         MOSS
            To get on the board.  Yeah.  How
            you goan'a get on the board sell'n
            a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll
            tell you what else.  You listening?
            I'll tell you what else: don't ever
            try to sell an Indian.

                         AARONOW
            I'd never try to sell an Indian.

                         MOSS
            You get those names come up, you
            ever get 'em, "Patel?"

                         AARONOW
            Mmm...

                         MOSS
            You ever get 'em?

                         AARONOW
            Well, I think I had one once.

                         MOSS
            You did?

                         AARONOW
            I...I don't know.

                                                           15.


                         MOSS
            You had one you'd know it.  Patel.
            They keep coming up.  I don't know.
            They like to talk to salesmen.
                   (pause)
            They're lonely, something.
                   (pause)
            They like to feel superior, I don't
            know.  Never bought a fucking thing.
            You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho
            this, the blah blah blah," "The
            Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My
            brother told me that..." They got a
            grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George.
            Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of
            which I want to tell you something:
                   (pause)
            I never got a cup of tea with them.
            You see them in the restaurants.  A
            supercilious race.  What is this
            look on their face all the time?  I
            don't know.
                   (pause)
            I don't know.  Their broads all
            look like they just got fucked with
            a dead cat, I don't know.
                   (pause)
            I don't know.  I don't like it.
            Christ...

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            The whole fuckin' thing...The
            pressure's just too great.  You're
            ab...you're absolu...they're too
            important.  All of them.  You go in
            the door.  I..."I got to close this
            fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or
            I don't win the Cadillac..." We
            fuckin' work too hard.  You work
            too hard.  We all, I remember when
            we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross
            Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of
            that..."

                         AARONOW
            They came in and they, you know...

                         MOSS
            Well, they fucked it up.

                                                           16.


                         AARONOW
            They did.

                         MOSS
            They killed the goose.

                         AARONOW
            They did.

                         MOSS
            And now...

                         AARONOW
            We're stuck with this...

                         MOSS
            We're stuck with this fucking shit...

                         AARONOW
            ...this shit...

                         MOSS
            It's too...

                         AARONOW
            It is.

                         MOSS
            Eh?

                         AARONOW
            It's too...

                         MOSS
            You get a bad month, all of a...

                         AARONOW
            You're on this...

                         MOSS
            All of, they got you on this
            "board..."

                         AARONOW
            I, I...I...

                         MOSS
            Some contest board...

                         AARONOW
            I...

                         MOSS
            It's not right.

                                                           17.


                         AARONOW
            It's not.

                         MOSS
            No.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            And it's not right to the customers.

                         MOSS
            I know it's not.  I'll tell you,
            you got, you know, you got...what
            did I learn as a kid on Western?
            Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him
            five cars over fifteen years.

                         AARONOW
            That's right?

                         MOSS
            Eh...?

                         AARONOW
            That's right?

                         MOSS
            Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys
            come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I
            know what I'll do: I'll go in and
            rob everyone blind and go to
            Argentina cause nobody ever thought
            of this before."

                         AARONOW
            ...that's right...

                         MOSS
            Eh?

                         AARONOW
            No.  That's absolutely right.

                         MOSS
            And so they kill the goose.  I, I,
            I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked
            all his life has got to...

                         AARONOW
            ...that's right...

                         MOSS
            ...cower in his boots...

                                                           18.


                         AARONOW
                   (simultaneously with "boots")
            Shoes, boots, yes...

                         MOSS
            For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand
            and you win the steak knives..."

                         AARONOW
            For some sales pro...

                         MOSS
            ...sales promotion, "You lose, then
            we fire your..." No.  It's
            medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're
            going to fire your ass." It's wrong.

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                         MOSS
            Yes, it is.  And you know who's
            responsible?

                         AARONOW
            Who?

                         MOSS
            You know who it is.  It's Mitch.
            And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have
            to be this way.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean,
            he's doing business for himself,
            he's got his, that list of his with
            the nurses...see?  You see?  That's
            thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A
            ten percent comm...why are we
            giving the rest away?  What are we
            giving ninety per...for nothing.
            For some jerk sit in the office
            tell you "Get out there and close."
            "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He
            goes out and buys.  He pays top
            dollar for the... you see?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                                                           19.


                         MOSS
            That's thinking.  Now, he's got the
            leads, he goes in business for
            himself.  He's...that's what I...
            that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a
            steady job, a couple bucks nobody's
            touched, who?"

                         AARONOW
            Nurses.

                         MOSS
            So Graff buys a fucking list of
            nurses, one grand--if he paid two
            I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand
            nurses, and he's going wild...

                         AARONOW
            He is?

                         MOSS
            He's doing very well.

                         AARONOW
            I heard that they were running cold.

                         MOSS
            The nurses?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                         MOSS
            You hear a lot of things...He's
            doing very well.  He's doing very
            well.

                         AARONOW
            With River Oaks?

                         MOSS
            River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of
            that shit.  Somebody told me, you
            know what he's clearing himself?
            Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.

                         AARONOW
            Himself?

                                                           20.


                         MOSS
            That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The
            leads.  He's got the good leads...
            what are we, we're sitting in the
            shit here.  Why?  We have to go to
            them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety
            percent our sale, we're paying to
            the office for the leads.

                         AARONOW
            The leads, the overhead, the
            telephones, there's lots of things.

                         MOSS
            What do you need? A telephone, some
            broad to say "Good morning,"
            nothing...nothing...

                         AARONOW
            No, it's not that simple, Dave...

                         MOSS
            Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you
            know what the hard part is?

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Starting up.

                         AARONOW
            What hard part?

                         MOSS
            Of doing the thing.  The dif...the
            difference.  Between me and Jerry
            Graff.  Going to business for
            yourself.  The hard part is...you
            know what it is?

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Just the act.

                         AARONOW
            What act?

                                                           21.


                         MOSS
            To say "I'm going on my own."
            'Cause what you do, George, let me
            tell you what you do: you find
            yourself in thrall to someone else.
            And we enslave ourselves.  To
            please.  To win some fucking
            toaster...to...to... and the guy
            who got there first made up those...

                         AARONOW
            That's right...

                         MOSS
            He made up those rules, and we're
            working for him.

                         AARONOW
            That's the truth...

                         MOSS
            That's the God's truth.  And it
            gets me depressed.  I swear that it
            does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn:
            "Somebody wins the Cadillac this
            month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."

                         AARONOW
            Huh.

                         MOSS
            You don't ax your sales force.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            You...

                         AARONOW
            You...

                         MOSS
            You build it!

                         AARONOW
            That's what I...

                         MOSS
            You fucking build it!  Men come...

                         AARONOW
            Men come work for you...

                                                           22.


                         MOSS
            ...you're absolutely right.

                         AARONOW
            They...

                         MOSS
            They have...

                         AARONOW
            When they...

                         MOSS
            Look look look look, when they
            build your business, then you can't
            fucking turn around, enslave them,
            treat them like children, fuck them
            up the ass, leave them to fend for
            themselves... no.
                   (pause)
            No.
                   (pause)
            You're absolutely right, and I want
            to tell you something.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            I want to tell you what somebody
            should do.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Someone should stand up and strike
            back.

                         AARONOW
            What do you mean?

                         MOSS
            Somebody...

                         AARONOW
            Yes...?

                         MOSS
            Should do something to them.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                                                           23.


                         MOSS
            Something.  To pay them back.
                   (pause)
            Someone, someone should hurt them.
            Murray and Mitch.

                         AARONOW
            Someone should hurt them.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
                   (pause)
            How?

                         MOSS
            How?  Do something to hurt them.
            Where they live.

                         AARONOW
            What?
                   (pause)


                         MOSS
            Someone should rob the office.

                         AARONOW
            Huh.

                         MOSS
            That's what I'm saying.  We were,
            if we were that kind of guys, to
            knock it off, and trash the joint,
            it looks like robbery, and take the
            fuckin' leads out of the files...go
            to Jerry Graff.

Long pause.

                         AARONOW
            What could somebody get for them?

                         MOSS
            What could we get for them?  I
            don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a-
            half a throw...I don't know...Hey,
            who knows what they're worth, what
            do they pay for them?  All
            told...must be, I'd... three bucks
            a throw...I don't know.

                                                           24.


                         AARONOW
            How many leads have we got?

                         MOSS
            The Glengarry...the premium leads...?
            I'd say we got five thousand.  Five.
            Five thousand leads.

                         AARONOW
            And you're saying a fella could
            take and sell these leads to Jerry
            Graff.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            How do you know he'd buy them?

                         MOSS
            Graff?  Because I worked for him.

                         AARONOW
            You haven't talked to him.

                         MOSS
            No.  What do you mean?  Have I
            talked to him about this?

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Yes.  I mean are you actually
            talking about this, or are we just...

                         MOSS
            No, we're just...

                         AARONOW
            We're just "talking" about it.

                         MOSS
            We're just speaking about it.
                   (pause)
            As an idea.

                         AARONOW
            As an idea.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            We're not actually talking about it.

                                                           25.


                         MOSS
            No.

                         AARONOW
            Talking about it as a...

                         MOSS
            No.

                         AARONOW
            As a robbery.

                         MOSS
            As a "robbery"?!  No.

                         AARONOW
            Well.  Well...

                         MOSS
            Hey.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            So all this, um, you didn't,
            actually, you didn't go talk to
            Graff.

                         MOSS
            Not actually, no.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You didn't?

                         MOSS
            No.  Not actually.

                         AARONOW
            Did you?

                         MOSS
            What did you say?

                         MOSS
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            I said, "Not actually." The fuck
            you care, George?  We're just
            talking...

                         AARONOW
            We are?

                                                           26.


                         MOSS
            Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Because, because, you know, it's a
            crime.

                         MOSS
            That's right.  It's a crime.  It is
            a crime.  It's also very safe.

                         AARONOW
            You're actually talking about this?

                         MOSS
            That's right.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You're going to steal the leads?

                         MOSS
            Have I said that?

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Are you?

Pause.

                         MOSS
            Did I say that?

                         AARONOW
            Did you talk to Graff?

                         MOSS
            Is that what I said?

                         AARONOW
            What did he say?

                         MOSS
            What did he say?  He'd buy them.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You're going to steal the leads and
            sell the leads to him?

                                                           27.


Pause.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            What will he pay?

                         MOSS
            A buck a shot.

                         AARONOW
            For five thousand?

                         MOSS
            However they are, that's the deal.
            A buck a throw.  Five thousand
            dollars.  Split it half and half.

                         AARONOW
            You're saying "me."

                         MOSS
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One
            night's work, and the job with
            Graff.  Working the premium leads.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            A job with Graff.

                         MOSS
            Is that what I said?

                         AARONOW
            He'd give me a job.

                         MOSS
            He would take you on.  Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Is that the truth?

                                                           28.


                         MOSS
            Yes.  It is, George.
                   (pause)
            Yes.  It's a big decision.
                   (pause)
            And it's a big reward.
                   (pause)
            It's a big reward.  For one night's
            work.
                   (pause)
            But it's got to be tonight.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            What?  What?  The leads.

                         AARONOW
            You have to steal the leads tonight?

                         MOSS
            That's right, the guys are moving
            them downtown.  After the thirtieth.
            Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.

                         AARONOW
            You're, you're saying so you have
            to go in there tonight and...

                         MOSS
            You...

                         AARONOW
            I'm sorry?

                         MOSS
            You.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Me?

                         MOSS
            You have to go in.
                   (pause)
            You have to get the leads.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            I do?

                                                           29.


                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            I...

                         MOSS
            It's not something for nothing,
            George, I took you in on this, you
            have to go.  That's your thing.
            I've made the deal with Graff.  I
            can't go.  I can't go in, I've
            spoken on this too much.  I've got
            a big mouth.
                   (pause)
            "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah
            blah blah "...the fucking tight ass
            company..."

                         AARONOW
            They'll know when you go over to
            Graff...

                         MOSS
            What will they know?  That I stole
            the leads?  I didn't steal the
            leads, I'm going to the movies
            tonight with a friend, and then I'm
            going to the Como Inn.  Why did I
            go to Graff?  I got a better deal.
            Period.  Let 'em prove something.
            They can't prove anything that's
            not the case.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Dave.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            You want me to break into the
            office tonight and steal the leads?

                         MOSS
            Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                                                           30.


                         MOSS
            Oh, yes, George.

                         AARONOW
            What does that mean?

                         MOSS
            Listen to this.  I have an alibi,
            I'm going to the Como Inn, why?
            Why?  The place gets robbed,
            they're going to come looking for
            me.  Why?  Because I probably did
            it.  Are you going to turn me in?
                   (pause)
            George?  Are you going to turn me in?

                         AARONOW
            What if you don't get caught?

                         MOSS
            They come to you, you going to turn
            me in?

                         AARONOW
            Why would they come to me?

                         MOSS
            They're going to come to everyone.

                         AARONOW
            Why would I do it?

                         MOSS
            You wouldn't, George, that's why
            I'm talking to you.  Answer me.
            They come to you.  You going to
            turn me in?

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            Are you sure?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.  I'm sure.

                         MOSS
            Then listen to this: I have to get
            those leads tonight.  That's
            something I have to do.  If I'm not
            at the movies...if I'm not eating
            over at the inn...If you don't do
            this, then I have to come in here...

                                                           31.


                         AARONOW
            ...you don't have to come in...

                         MOSS
            ...and rob the place...

                         AARONOW
            ...I thought that we were only
            talking...

                         MOSS
            ...they take me, then.  They're
            going to ask me who were my
            accomplices.

                         AARONOW
            Me?

                         MOSS
            Absolutely.

                         AARONOW
            That's ridiculous.

                         MOSS
            Well, to the law, you're an
            accessory.  Before the fact.

                         AARONOW
            I didn't ask to be.

                         MOSS
            Then tough luck, George, because
            you are.

                         AARONOW
            Why?  Why, because you only told me
            about it?

                         MOSS
            That's right.

                         AARONOW
            Why are you doing this to me, Dave.
            Why are you talking this way to me?
            I don't understand.  Why are you
            doing this at all...?

                         MOSS
            That's none of your fucking
            business...

                                                           32.


                         AARONOW
            Well, well, well, talk to me, we
            sat down to eat dinner, and here
            I'm a criminal...

                         MOSS
            You went for it.

                         AARONOW
            In the abstract...

                         MOSS
            So I'm making it concrete.

                         AARONOW
            Why?

                         MOSS
            Why?  Why you going to give me five
            grand?

                         AARONOW
            Do you need five grand?

                         MOSS
            Is that what I just said?

                         AARONOW
            You need money?  Is that the...

                         MOSS
            Hey, hey, let's just keep it
            simple, what I need is not
            the...what do you need...?

                         AARONOW
            What is the five grand?
                   (pause)
            What is the, you said that we were
            going to split five...

                         MOSS
            I lied.
                   (pause)
            Alright?  My end is my business.
            Your end's twenty-five.  In or out.
            You tell me, you're out you take
            the consequences.

                         AARONOW
            I do?

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                                                           33.


Pause.

                         AARONOW
            And why is that?

                         MOSS
            Because you listened.

SCENE THREE

The restaurant.  Roma is seated alone at the booth.  Lingk
is at the booth next to him.  Roma is talking to him.

                         ROMA
            ...all train compartments smell
            vaguely of shit.  It gets so you
            don't mind it.  That's the worst
            thing that I can confess.  You know
            how long it took me to get there?
            A long time.  When you die you're
            going to regret the things you
            don't do.  You think you're queer...?
            I'm going to tell you something:
            we're all queer.  You think that
            you're a thief?  So what?  You get
            befuddled by a middle-class
            morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut
            it out.  You cheated on your
            wife...?  You did it, live with it.
                   (pause)
            You fuck little girls, so be it.
            There's an absolute morality?  May
            be.  And then what?  If you think
            there is, then be that thing.  Bad
            people go to hell?  I don't think
            so.  If you think that, act that
            way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes.
            I won't live in it.  That's me.
            You ever take a dump made you feel
            you'd just slept for twelve hours...?

                         LINGK
            Did I...?

                         ROMA
            Yes.

                         LINGK
            I don't know.

                                                           34.


                         ROMA
            Or a piss...?  A great meal fades
            in reflection.  Everything else
            gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's
            only food.  This shit we eat, it
            keeps us going.  But it's only food.
            The great fucks that you may have
            had.  What do you remember about
            them?

                         LINGK
            What do I...?

            Yes.

            Mmmm...

                         ROMA
            I don't know.  For me, I'm saying,
            what is is, it's probably not the
            orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on
            your neck, something her eyes did.
            There was a sound she made...or,
            me, lying, in the, I'll tell you:
            me lying in bed; the next day she
            brought me café au lait.  She gives
            me a cigarette, my balls feel like
            concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying,
            what is our life?
                   (pause)
            It's looking forward or it's
            looking back.  And that's our life.
            That's it.  Where is the moment?
                   (pause)
            And what is it that we're afraid of?
            Loss.  What else?
                   (pause)
            The bank closes.  We get sick, my
            wife died on a plane, the stock
            market collapsed...the house burnt
            down...what of these happen...?
            None on 'em.  We worry anyway.
            What does this mean?  I'm not
            secure.  How can I be secure?
                   (pause)
            Through amassing wealth beyond all
            measure?  No.  And what's beyond
            all measure?  That's a sickness.
            That's a trap.  There is no measure.
            Only greed.  How can we act?

                         ROMA (CONT'D)
            The right way, we would say, to
            deal with this: "There is a one-in-
            a-million chance that so and so
            will happen...Fuck it, it won't
            happen to me..." No.  We know
            that's not the right way I think.
                   (pause)
            We say the correct way to deal with
            this is "There is a one-in-so-and-
            so chance this will happen...God
            protect me.  I am powerless, let it
            not happen to me..." But no to that.
            I say.  There's something else.
            What is it? "If it happens, AS IT
            MAY for that is not within our
            powers, I will deal with it, just
            as I do today with what draws my
            concern today." I say this is how
            we must act.  I do those things
            which seem correct to me today.  I
            trust myself.  And if security
            concerns me, I do that which today
            I think will make me secure.  And
            every day I do that, when that day
            arrives that I need a reserve, [a]
            odds are that I have it, and [b]
            the true reserve that I have is the
            strength that I have of acting each
            day without fear.
                   (pause)
            According to the dictates of my
            mind.

            Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real
            estate.  Now: what are they?
                   (pause)
            An opportunity.  To what?  To make
            money?  Perhaps.  To lose money?
            Perhaps.  To "indulge" and to
            "learn" about ourselves?  Perhaps.
            So fucking what?  What isn't?
            They're an opportunity.  That's all.
            They're an event.  A guy comes up
            to you, you make a call, you send
            in a brochure, it doesn't matter,
            "There're these properties I'd like

            Security?
                   (pause)
            Comfort?
                   (pause)
            All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO
            YOU.

            That's all it is.  How are they
            different?
                   (pause)
            Some poor newly married guy gets
            run down by a cab.  Some busboy
            wins the lottery.
                   (pause)
            All it is, it's a carnival.  What's
            special...what draws us?
                   (pause)
            We're all different.
                   (pause)
            We're not the same.
                   (pause)
            We are not the same.
                   (pause)
            Hmmm.
                   (pause, sighs)
            It's been a long day.
                   (pause)
            What are you drinking?

                         LINGK
            Gimlet.

            Well, let's have a couple more.  My
            name is Richard Roma, what's yours?

                         LINGK
            Lingk.  James Lingk.

                         ROMA
            James.  I'm glad to meet you.

            I want to show you something.

            It might mean nothing to you...and
            it might not.

                   (pause.  He takes out
                   a small map and
                   spreads it on a table)
            What is that?  Florida.  Glengarry
            Highlands.  Florida. "Florida.
            Bullshit." And maybe that's true;
            and that's what I said: but look
            here: what is this?  This is a
            piece of land.  Listen to what I'm
            going to tell you now:

The real estate office.  Ransacked.  A broken plateglass
window boarded up, glass all over the floor.  Aaronow and
Williamson standing around, smoking.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            People used to say that there are
            numbers of such magnitude that
            multiplying them by two made no
            difference.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Who used to say that?

                         AARONOW
            In school.

Pause.  Baylen, a detective, comes out of the inner office.

                         BAYLEN
            Alright...?

Roma enters from the street.

                         ROMA
            Williamson...Williamson, they stole
            the contracts...?

            Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm
            talking about a fuckin' Cadillac
            car that you owe me...

                         WILLIAMSON
            They didn't get your contract.  I
            filed it before I left.

                         ROMA
            They didn't get my contracts.

                         WILLIAMSON
            They--excuse me...

He goes back into inner room with the Detective.

                         ROMA
            Oh, fuck.  Fuck.
                   (he starts kicking
                   the desk)

                   (goes to the door
                   Williamson went into,
                   tries the door; it's locked)

Williamson comes out.

                         WILLIAMSON
            They didn't get the contracts.

                         ROMA

                         WILLIAMSON
            Listen to me: They got some of them.

                         ROMA
            Some of them...

            Moss...Who told him?

            What...talk to me.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You closed him yesterday.

                         ROMA
            Yes.

                         WILLIAMSON
            It went down.  I filed it.

                         ROMA
            You did?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Yes.

                         ROMA
            Then I'm over the fucking top and
            you owe me a Cadillac.

                   the inner room)
            Please don't leave.  I'm going to

Pause.

                         BAYLEN
            Yes.

Pause.

                         ROMA
            My name is Richard Roma.

Baylen goes back into the inner room.

                         AARONOW
            I, you know, they should be insured.

                         ROMA
            What do you care...?

            you needn't feel that you're being

            you if she knew.  This is your life.

            me.  Now how did you know that
            contract was on my desk?

            up something...You got an alibi
            last night?  You better have one.
            What did you do with the leads?  If
            you tell me what you did with the
            leads, we can talk.

                         LEVENE

            I won't turn you in.  If you don't,
            I am going to tell the cop you
            stole them, Mitch and Murray will
            see that you go to jail.  Believe
            me they will.  Now, what did you do
            with the leads?  I'm walking in
            that door--you have five seconds to
            tell me: or you are going to jail.

                         LEVENE
            I...

                                                           86.


                         WILLIAMSON
            I don't care.  You understand?
            Where are the leads?
                   (pause)
            Alright.

Williamson goes to open the office door.

                         LEVENE
            I sold them to Jerry Graff.

                         WILLIAMSON
            How much did you get for them?
                   (pause)
            How much did you get for them?

                         LEVENE
            Five thousand.  I kept half.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Who kept the other half?

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Do I have to tell you?
                   (pause, Williamson
                   starts to open the door)
            Moss.

                         WILLIAMSON
            That was easy, wasn't it?

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            It was his idea.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Was it?

            I...I'm sure he got more than the
            five, actually.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Uh-huh?

                         LEVENE
            He told me my share was twenty-five.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Mmm.

                                                           87.

            Okay: I...look: I'm going to make
            it worth your while.  I am.  I
            turned this thing around.  I closed
            the old stuff, I can do it again.
            I'm the one's going to close 'em.
            I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this
            thing a...I can do that, I can do
            anyth...last night.  I'm going to
            tell you, I was ready to Do the
            Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this,
            we'll get well..." Why not.  Big
            fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping
            to get caught.  To put me out of
            my...
                   (pause)
            But it taught me something.  What
            it taught me, that you've got to
            get out there.  Big deal.  So I
            wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I
            was cut out to be a salesman.  And
            now I'm back, and I got my balls
            back...and, you know, John, you
            have the advantage on me now:
            Whatever it takes to make it right,
            we'll make it right.  We're going
            to make it right.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I want to tell you something,
            Shelly.  You have a big mouth.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            What?

                   Detective's door)

            No, I don't think so, Shel.

            No, I think I don't want your money.
            I think you fucked up my office.
            And I think you're going away.

            Twenty percent.

            Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What sales?

                                                           89.

            see the memos...?  They're nuts...
            they used to call in every week.
            When I was with Webb.  And we were

            you see how they were living?  How

Pause.

            The people are insane.  They just
            like talking to salesmen.

Williamson starts for door.

                         LEVENE
            Don't.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I'm sorry.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Because I don't like you.

                         LEVENE

                   "job," exiting the office)

SCENE ONE

A booth at a Chinese restaurant, Williamson and Levene are
seated at the booth.

                         LEVENE
            John...John...John.  Okay.  John.
            John.  Look:
                   (pause)
            The Glengarry Highland's leads,
            you're sending Roma out.  Fine.
            He's a good man.  We know what he
            is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying,
            you look at the board, he's
            throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's
            throwing them away, he's throwing
            the leads away.  All that I'm
            saying, that you're wasting leads.
            I don't want to tell you your job.
            All that I'm saying, things get
            set, I know they do, you get a
            certain mindset... A guy gets a
            reputation.  We know how this...all
            I'm saying, put a closer on the job.
            There's more than one man for the...
            Put a...wait a second, put a proven
            man out...and you watch, now wait a
            second--and you watch your dollar
            volumes...You start closing them
            for fifty 'stead of twenty-
            five...you put a closer on the...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Shelly, you blew the last...

                         LEVENE
            No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's
            back up here, I did...will you
            please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I
            didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't
            "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out,
            one I closed...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...you didn't close...

                         LEVENE
            ...I, if you'd listen to me.
            Please.  I closed the cocksucker.
            His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know
            he was married...he, the judge
            invalidated the...

                                                            2.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Shelly...

                         LEVENE
            ...and what is that, John?  What?
            Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I
            pray in your life you will never
            find it runs in streaks.  That's
            what it does, that's all it's doing.
            Streaks.  I pray it misses you.
            That's all I want to say.

                         WILLIAMSON
                   (pause)
            What about the other two?

                         LEVENE
            What two?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Four.  You had four leads.  One
            kicked out, one the judge, you say...

                         LEVENE
            ...you want to see the court
            records?  John?  Eh?  You want to
            go down...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...no...

                         LEVENE
            ...do you want to go downtown...?

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...no...

                         LEVENE
            ...then...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...I only...

                         LEVENE
            ...then what is this "you say"
            shit, what is that?
                   (pause)
            What is that...?

                         WILLIAMSON
            All that I'm saying...

                                                            3.


                         LEVENE
            What is this "you say"?  A deal
            kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit,
            Williamson, shit.  You...Moss...
            Roma...look at the sheets...look at
            the sheets.  Nineteen eighty,
            eighty-one...eighty-two...six
            months of eighty-two...who's there?
            Who's up there?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Roma.

                         LEVENE
            Under him?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Moss.

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April,
            September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't
            fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an
            order taker, John.  He talks, he
            talks a good game, look at the
            board, and it's me, John, it's me...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Not lately it isn't.

                         LEVENE
            Lately kiss my ass lately.  That
            isn't how you build an org...talk,
            talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch.
            When we were on Peterson, who paid
            for his fucking car?  You talk to
            him.  The Seville...?  He came in,
            "You bought that for me Shelly."
            Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing.
            Sixty-five, when we were there,
            with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em
            downtown.  What was that?  Luck?
            That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John.
            You're burning my ass, I can't get
            a fucking lead...you think that was
            luck.  My stats for those years?
            Bullshit...over that period of
            time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck.
            It was skill.  You want to throw
            that away, John...?  You want to
            throw that away?

                         WILLIAMSON
            It isn't me...

                                                            4.


                         LEVENE
            ...it isn't you...?  Who is it?
            Who is this I'm talking to?  I need
            the leads...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...after the thirtieth...

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get
            on the board the thirtieth, they're
            going to can my ass.  I need the
            leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm
            gone, and you're going to miss me,
            John, I swear to you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Murray...

                         LEVENE
            ...you talk to Murray...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I have.  And my job is to marshal
            those leads...

                         LEVENE
            Marshal the leads...marshal the
            leads?  What the fuck, what bus did
            you get off of, we're here to
            fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the
            leads.  What the fuck talk is that?
            What the fuck talk is that?  Where
            did you learn that?  In school?
                   (pause)
            That's "talk," my friend, that's
            "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm
            the man to sell.  I'm getting
            garbage.
                   (pause)
            You're giving it to me, and what
            I'm saying is it's fucked.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You're saying that I'm fucked.

                         LEVENE
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Let me...

                                                            5.


                         LEVENE
            ...and I'm going to get bounced and
            you're...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...let me...are you listening to
            me...?

                         LEVENE
            Yes.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Let me tell you something, Shelly.
            I do what I'm hired to do.
            I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to
            watch the leads.  I'm given...hold
            on, I'm given a policy.  My job is
            to do that.  What I'm told.  That's
            it.  You, wait a second, anybody
            falls below a certain mark I'm not
            permitted to give them the premium
            leads.

                         LEVENE
            Then how do they come up above that
            mark?  With dreck...?  That's
            nonsense.  Explain this to me.
            'Cause it's a waste, and it's a
            stupid waste.  I want to tell you
            something...

                         WILLIAMSON
            You know what those leads cost?

                         LEVENE
            The premium leads.  Yes.  I know
            what they cost.  John.  Because I,
            I generated the dollar revenue
            sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen
            senny-nine, you know what I made?
            Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand
            dollars.  John?  For Murray... For
            Mitch...look at the sheets...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Murray said...

                         LEVENE
            Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You
            know?  You tell him I said so.
            What does he fucking know?  He's
            going to have a "sales"
            contest...you know what our sales
            contest used to be?

                         LEVENE (CONT'D)
            Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on
            the ground.  Murray?  When was the
            last time he went out on a sit?
            Sales contest?  It's laughable.
            It's cold out there now, John.
            It's tight.  Money is tight.  This
            ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It
            just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a
            good man--but I need a...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Will you please wait a second.
            Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me:
            the hot leads...

                         LEVENE
            ...ah, fuck this...

            The...Shelly?

            The hot leads are assigned according

                         LEVENE
            That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You
            don't look at the fucking percentage.
            You look at the gross.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Either way.  You're out.

                         LEVENE
            I'm out.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Yes.

                         LEVENE
            I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm
            out, you're giving me toilet paper.

                         LEVENE (CONT'D)
            I've seen those leads.  I saw them
            when I was at Homestead, we pitched
            those cocksuckers Rio Rancho
            nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't
            buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking
            toaster.  They're broke, John.
            They're cold.  They're deadbeats,
            you can't judge on that.  Even so.
            Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine.
            Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING
            LEADS they got their money in a
            sock.  They're fucking Polacks,
            John.  Four leads.  I close two.
            Two.  Fifty per...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...they kicked out.

                         LEVENE
            They all kick out.  You run in
            streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm...
            I'm...don't look at the board, look
            at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone.
            Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at
            Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff.
            You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT.
            I got to get on the fucking board.
            Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who
            ever picked up a check I was flush.
            Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch
            himself...Those guys lived on the
            business I brought in.  They lived
            on it...and so did Murray, John.
            You were here you'd of benefited
            from it too.  And now I'm saying
            this.  Do I want charity?  Do I
            want pity?  I want sits.  I want
            leads that don't come right out of
            a phone book.  Give me a lead
            hotter than that, I'll go in and
            close it.  Give me a chance.
            That's all I want.  I'm going to
            get up on that fucking board and
            all I want is a chance.  It's a
            streak and I'm going to turn it
            around.
                   (pause)
            I need your help.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't do it, Shelly.

                                                            8.


Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            The leads are assigned randomly...

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit, bullshit, you assign
            them... What are you telling me?

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...apart from the top men on the
            contest board.

                         LEVENE
            Then put me on the board.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You start closing again, you'll be
            on the board.

                         LEVENE
            I can't close these leads, John.
            No one can.  It's a joke.  John,
            look, just give me a hot lead.
            Just give me two of the premium
            leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a
            "test" and I promise you...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't do it, Shel.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            I'll give you ten percent.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Of what?

                         LEVENE
            And what if you don't close.

                         LEVENE
            I will close.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What if you don't close...?

                                                            9.


                         LEVENE
            I will close.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked.
            You see...?  Then it's my job.
            That's what I'm telling you.

                         LEVENE
            I will close.  John, John, ten
            percent.  I can get hot.  You know
            that...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Not lately you can't...

                         LEVENE
            Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck
            that.  Fuck it...Get on my side.
            Go with me.  Let's do something.
            You want to run this office, run it.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Twenty percent.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Alright.

                         WILLIAMSON
            And fifty bucks a lead.

                         LEVENE
            John.
                   (pause)
            Listen.  I want to talk to you.
            Permit me to do this a second.  I'm
            older than you.  A man acquires a
            reputation.  On the street.  What
            he does when he's up, what he does
            otherwise...I said "ten," you said
            "no." You said "twenty." I said
            "fine," I'm not going to fuck with
            you, how can I beat that, you tell
            me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay.
            Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty
            percent, and fifty bucks a lead.
            That's fine.  For now.  That's fine.
            A month or two we'll talk.  A month
            from now.  Next month.  After the
            thirtieth.
                   (pause)
            We'll talk.

                                                           10.


                         WILLIAMSON
            What are we going to say?

                         LEVENE
            No.  You're right.  That's for
            later.  We'll talk in a month.
            What have you got?  I want two sits.
            Tonight.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I'm not sure I have two.

                         LEVENE
            I saw the board.  You've got four...

                         WILLIAMSON
                   (snaps)
            I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit.  They ain't been in the
            office yet.  Give 'em some stiff.
            We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two
            sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of
            'em, six and ten, you can do
            it...six and ten...eight and
            eleven, I don't give a shit, you
            set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits
            in Des Plaines.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Alright.

                         LEVENE
            Good.  Now we're talking.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            A hundred bucks.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Now?
                   (pause)
            Now?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Now.
                   (pause)
            Yes...When?

                                                           11.


                         LEVENE
            Ah, shit, John.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I wish I could.

                         LEVENE
            You fucking asshole.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it, John.
                   (pause)
            I'll pay you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
            I'm coming in here with the sales,
            I'll pay you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it, when I pay, the
            gas...I get back the hotel, I'll
            bring it in tomorrow.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Can't do it.

                         LEVENE
            I'll give you thirty on them now,
            I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've
            got it at the hotel.
                   (pause)
            John?
                   (pause)
            We do that, for chrissake?

                         WILLIAMSON
            No.

                         LEVENE
            I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?
                   (pause)
            John.
                   (long pause)
            John: my daughter...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't do it, Shelly...

                                                           12.


                         LEVENE
            Well, I want to tell you something,
            fella, wasn't long I could pick up
            the phone, call Murray and I'd have
            your job.  You know that?  Not too
            long ago.  For what?  For nothing.
            "Mur, this new kid burns my ass."
            "Shelly, he's out." You're gone
            before I'm back from lunch.  I
            bought him a trip to Bermuda once...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I have to go...
                   (gets up)


                         LEVENE
            Wait.  Alright.  Fine.
                   (starts going in
                   pocket for money)
            The one.  Give me the lead.  Give
            me the one lead.  The best one you
            have.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't split them.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Because I say so.

                         LEVENE
                   (pause)
            Is that it?  Is that it?  You want
            to do business that way...?

Williamson gets up, leaves money on the table.

                         LEVENE
            You want to do business that way...?
            Alright.  Alright.  Alright.
            Alright.  What is there on the
            other list...?

                         WILLIAMSON
            You want something off the B list?

                         LEVENE
            Yeah.  Yeah.

                                                           13.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Is that what you're saying?

                         LEVENE
            That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.
                   (pause)
            I'd like something off the other
            list.  Which, very least, that I'm
            entitled to.  If I'm still working
            here, which for the moment I guess
            that I am.
                   (pause)
            What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to
            you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            That's alright.

                         LEVENE
            The deal still stands, our other
            thing.

Williamson shrugs.  Starts out of the booth.

                         LEVENE
            Good.  Mmm.  I, you know, I left my
            wallet back at the hotel.

SCENE TWO

A booth at the restaurant.  Moss and Aaronow seated.  After
the meal.

                         MOSS
            Polacks and deadbeats.

                         AARONOW
            ...Polacks...

                         MOSS
            Deadbeats all.

                         AARONOW
            ...they hold on to their money...

                         MOSS
            All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens
            to us all.

                         AARONOW
            Where am I going to work?

                                                           14.


                         MOSS
            You have to cheer up, George, you
            aren't out yet.

                         AARONOW
            I'm not?

                         MOSS
            You missed a fucking sale.  Big
            deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal.
            How you going to sell 'em in the
            first place...?  Your mistake, you
            shoun'a took the lead.

                         AARONOW
            I had to.

                         MOSS
            You had to, yeah.  Why?

                         AARONOW
            To get on the...

                         MOSS
            To get on the board.  Yeah.  How
            you goan'a get on the board sell'n
            a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll
            tell you what else.  You listening?
            I'll tell you what else: don't ever
            try to sell an Indian.

                         AARONOW
            I'd never try to sell an Indian.

                         MOSS
            You get those names come up, you
            ever get 'em, "Patel?"

                         AARONOW
            Mmm...

                         MOSS
            You ever get 'em?

                         AARONOW
            Well, I think I had one once.

                         MOSS
            You did?

                         AARONOW
            I...I don't know.

                                                           15.


                         MOSS
            You had one you'd know it.  Patel.
            They keep coming up.  I don't know.
            They like to talk to salesmen.
                   (pause)
            They're lonely, something.
                   (pause)
            They like to feel superior, I don't
            know.  Never bought a fucking thing.
            You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho
            this, the blah blah blah," "The
            Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My
            brother told me that..." They got a
            grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George.
            Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of
            which I want to tell you something:
                   (pause)
            I never got a cup of tea with them.
            You see them in the restaurants.  A
            supercilious race.  What is this
            look on their face all the time?  I
            don't know.
                   (pause)
            I don't know.  Their broads all
            look like they just got fucked with
            a dead cat, I don't know.
                   (pause)
            I don't know.  I don't like it.
            Christ...

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            The whole fuckin' thing...The
            pressure's just too great.  You're
            ab...you're absolu...they're too
            important.  All of them.  You go in
            the door.  I..."I got to close this
            fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or
            I don't win the Cadillac..." We
            fuckin' work too hard.  You work
            too hard.  We all, I remember when
            we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross
            Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of
            that..."

                         AARONOW
            They came in and they, you know...

                         MOSS
            Well, they fucked it up.

                                                           16.


                         AARONOW
            They did.

                         MOSS
            They killed the goose.

                         AARONOW
            They did.

                         MOSS
            And now...

                         AARONOW
            We're stuck with this...

                         MOSS
            We're stuck with this fucking shit...

                         AARONOW
            ...this shit...

                         MOSS
            It's too...

                         AARONOW
            It is.

                         MOSS
            Eh?

                         AARONOW
            It's too...

                         MOSS
            You get a bad month, all of a...

                         AARONOW
            You're on this...

                         MOSS
            All of, they got you on this
            "board..."

                         AARONOW
            I, I...I...

                         MOSS
            Some contest board...

                         AARONOW
            I...

                         MOSS
            It's not right.

                                                           17.


                         AARONOW
            It's not.

                         MOSS
            No.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            And it's not right to the customers.

                         MOSS
            I know it's not.  I'll tell you,
            you got, you know, you got...what
            did I learn as a kid on Western?
            Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him
            five cars over fifteen years.

                         AARONOW
            That's right?

                         MOSS
            Eh...?

                         AARONOW
            That's right?

                         MOSS
            Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys
            come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I
            know what I'll do: I'll go in and
            rob everyone blind and go to
            Argentina cause nobody ever thought
            of this before."

                         AARONOW
            ...that's right...

                         MOSS
            Eh?

                         AARONOW
            No.  That's absolutely right.

                         MOSS
            And so they kill the goose.  I, I,
            I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked
            all his life has got to...

                         AARONOW
            ...that's right...

                         MOSS
            ...cower in his boots...

                         AARONOW
                   (simultaneously with "boots")
            Shoes, boots, yes...

                         MOSS
            For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand
            and you win the steak knives..."

                         AARONOW
            For some sales pro...

                         MOSS
            ...sales promotion, "You lose, then
            we fire your..." No.  It's
            medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're
            going to fire your ass." It's wrong.

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                         MOSS
            Yes, it is.  And you know who's
            responsible?

                         AARONOW
            Who?

                         MOSS
            You know who it is.  It's Mitch.
            And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have
            to be this way.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean,
            he's doing business for himself,
            he's got his, that list of his with
            the nurses...see?  You see?  That's
            thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A
            ten percent comm...why are we
            giving the rest away?  What are we
            giving ninety per...for nothing.
            For some jerk sit in the office
            tell you "Get out there and close."
            "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He
            goes out and buys.  He pays top
            dollar for the... you see?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                                                           19.


                         MOSS
            That's thinking.  Now, he's got the
            leads, he goes in business for
            himself.  He's...that's what I...
            that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a
            steady job, a couple bucks nobody's
            touched, who?"

                         AARONOW
            Nurses.

                         MOSS
            So Graff buys a fucking list of
            nurses, one grand--if he paid two
            I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand
            nurses, and he's going wild...

                         AARONOW
            He is?

                         MOSS
            He's doing very well.

                         AARONOW
            I heard that they were running cold.

                         MOSS
            The nurses?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                         MOSS
            You hear a lot of things...He's
            doing very well.  He's doing very
            well.

                         AARONOW
            With River Oaks?

                         MOSS
            River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of
            that shit.  Somebody told me, you
            know what he's clearing himself?
            Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.

                         AARONOW
            Himself?

                                                           20.


                         MOSS
            That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The
            leads.  He's got the good leads...
            what are we, we're sitting in the
            shit here.  Why?  We have to go to
            them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety
            percent our sale, we're paying to
            the office for the leads.

                         AARONOW
            The leads, the overhead, the
            telephones, there's lots of things.

                         MOSS
            What do you need? A telephone, some
            broad to say "Good morning,"
            nothing...nothing...

                         AARONOW
            No, it's not that simple, Dave...

                         MOSS
            Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you
            know what the hard part is?

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Starting up.

                         AARONOW
            What hard part?

                         MOSS
            Of doing the thing.  The dif...the
            difference.  Between me and Jerry
            Graff.  Going to business for
            yourself.  The hard part is...you
            know what it is?

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Just the act.

                         AARONOW
            What act?

                                                           21.


                         MOSS
            To say "I'm going on my own."
            'Cause what you do, George, let me
            tell you what you do: you find
            yourself in thrall to someone else.
            And we enslave ourselves.  To
            please.  To win some fucking
            toaster...to...to... and the guy
            who got there first made up those...

                         AARONOW
            That's right...

                         MOSS
            He made up those rules, and we're
            working for him.

                         AARONOW
            That's the truth...

                         MOSS
            That's the God's truth.  And it
            gets me depressed.  I swear that it
            does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn:
            "Somebody wins the Cadillac this
            month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."

                         AARONOW
            Huh.

                         MOSS
            You don't ax your sales force.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            You...

                         AARONOW
            You...

                         MOSS
            You build it!

                         AARONOW
            That's what I...

                         MOSS
            You fucking build it!  Men come...

                         MOSS
            ...you're absolutely right.

                         AARONOW
            They...

                         MOSS
            They have...

            When they...

                         MOSS
            Look look look look, when they
            build your business, then you can't
            fucking turn around, enslave them,
            treat them like children, fuck them
            up the ass, leave them to fend for

            No.

            You're absolutely right, and I want

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            I want to tell you what somebody
            should do.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Someone should stand up and strike
            back.

                         AARONOW
            What do you mean?

                         MOSS
            Somebody...

                         AARONOW
            Yes...?

                         MOSS
            Should do something to them.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                                                           23.


                         MOSS
            Something.  To pay them back.

            Someone, someone should hurt them.
            Murray and Mitch.

                         AARONOW
            Someone should hurt them.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
                   (pause)
            How?

                         MOSS
            How?  Do something to hurt them.
            Where they live.

                         AARONOW
            What?
                   (pause)


                         MOSS
            Someone should rob the office.

                         AARONOW
            Huh.

                         MOSS
            That's what I'm saying.  We were,
            if we were that kind of guys, to
            knock it off, and trash the joint,
            it looks like robbery, and take the
            fuckin' leads out of the files...go
            to Jerry Graff.

Long pause.

                         AARONOW
            What could somebody get for them?

                         MOSS
            What could we get for them?  I
            don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a-
            half a throw...I don't know...Hey,
            who knows what they're worth, what
            do they pay for them?  All

            How many leads have we got?

                         MOSS
            The Glengarry...the premium leads...?
            I'd say we got five thousand.  Five.
            Five thousand leads.

                         AARONOW
            And you're saying a fella could
            take and sell these leads to Jerry
            Graff.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            How do you know he'd buy them?

                         MOSS
            Graff?  Because I worked for him.

                         AARONOW
            You haven't talked to him.

                         MOSS
            No.  What do you mean?  Have I
            talked to him about this?

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Yes.  I mean are you actually
            talking about this, or are we just...

                         MOSS
            No, we're just...

                         AARONOW
            We're just "talking" about it.

            We're just speaking about it.

            As an idea.

            As an idea.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

            Talking about it as a...

                         MOSS
            No.

                         AARONOW
            As a robbery.

                         MOSS
            As a "robbery"?!  No.

                         AARONOW
            Well.  Well...

                         MOSS
            Hey.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            So all this, um, you didn't,
            actually, you didn't go talk to
            Graff.

                         MOSS
            Not actually, no.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You didn't?

                         MOSS
            No.  Not actually.

                         AARONOW
            Did you?

                         MOSS
            What did you say?

                         MOSS
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            I said, "Not actually." The fuck
            you care, George?  We're just
            talking...

                         AARONOW
            We are?

                                                           26.


                         MOSS
            Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Because, because, you know, it's a
            crime.

                         MOSS
            That's right.  It's a crime.  It is
            a crime.  It's also very safe.

                         AARONOW
            You're actually talking about this?

                         MOSS
            That's right.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You're going to steal the leads?

                         MOSS
            Have I said that?

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Are you?

Pause.

                         MOSS
            Did I say that?

                         AARONOW
            Did you talk to Graff?

                         MOSS
            Is that what I said?

                         AARONOW
            What did he say?

                         MOSS
            What did he say?  He'd buy them.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You're going to steal the leads and
            sell the leads to him?

                                                           27.


Pause.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            What will he pay?

                         MOSS
            A buck a shot.

                         AARONOW
            For five thousand?

                         MOSS
            However they are, that's the deal.
            A buck a throw.  Five thousand
            dollars.  Split it half and half.

                         AARONOW
            You're saying "me."

                         MOSS
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One
            night's work, and the job with
            Graff.  Working the premium leads.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            A job with Graff.

                         MOSS
            Is that what I said?

                         AARONOW
            He'd give me a job.

                         MOSS
            He would take you on.  Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Is that the truth?

                                                           28.


                         MOSS
            Yes.  It is, George.
                   (pause)
            Yes.  It's a big decision.
                   (pause)
            And it's a big reward.
                   (pause)
            It's a big reward.  For one night's
            work.
                   (pause)
            But it's got to be tonight.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            What?  What?  The leads.

                         AARONOW
            You have to steal the leads tonight?

                         MOSS
            That's right, the guys are moving
            them downtown.  After the thirtieth.
            Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.

                         AARONOW
            You're, you're saying so you have
            to go in there tonight and...

                         MOSS
            You...

                         AARONOW
            I'm sorry?

                         MOSS
            You.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Me?

                         MOSS
            You have to go in.
                   (pause)
            You have to get the leads.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            I do?

                                                           29.


                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            I...

                         MOSS
            It's not something for nothing,
            George, I took you in on this, you
            have to go.  That's your thing.
            I've made the deal with Graff.  I
            can't go.  I can't go in, I've
            spoken on this too much.  I've got
            a big mouth.
                   (pause)
            "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah
            blah blah "...the fucking tight ass
            company..."

                         AARONOW
            They'll know when you go over to
            Graff...

                         MOSS
            What will they know?  That I stole
            the leads?  I didn't steal the
            leads, I'm going to the movies
            tonight with a friend, and then I'm
            going to the Como Inn.  Why did I
            go to Graff?  I got a better deal.
            Period.  Let 'em prove something.
            They can't prove anything that's
            not the case.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Dave.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            You want me to break into the
            office tonight and steal the leads?

                         MOSS
            Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                                                           30.


                         MOSS
            Oh, yes, George.

                         AARONOW
            What does that mean?

                         MOSS
            Listen to this.  I have an alibi,
            I'm going to the Como Inn, why?
            Why?  The place gets robbed,
            they're going to come looking for
            me.  Why?  Because I probably did
            it.  Are you going to turn me in?
                   (pause)
            George?  Are you going to turn me in?

                         AARONOW
            What if you don't get caught?

                         MOSS
            They come to you, you going to turn
            me in?

                         AARONOW
            Why would they come to me?

                         MOSS
            They're going to come to everyone.

                         AARONOW
            Why would I do it?

                         MOSS
            You wouldn't, George, that's why
            I'm talking to you.  Answer me.
            They come to you.  You going to
            turn me in?

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            Are you sure?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.  I'm sure.

                         MOSS
            Then listen to this: I have to get
            those leads tonight.  That's
            something I have to do.  If I'm not
            at the movies...if I'm not eating
            over at the inn...If you don't do
            this, then I have to come in here...

                                                           31.


                         AARONOW
            ...you don't have to come in...

                         MOSS
            ...and rob the place...

                         AARONOW
            ...I thought that we were only
            talking...

                         MOSS
            ...they take me, then.  They're
            going to ask me who were my
            accomplices.

                         AARONOW
            Me?

                         MOSS
            Absolutely.

                         AARONOW
            That's ridiculous.

                         MOSS
            Well, to the law, you're an
            accessory.  Before the fact.

                         AARONOW
            I didn't ask to be.

                         MOSS
            Then tough luck, George, because
            you are.

                         AARONOW
            Why?  Why, because you only told me
            about it?

                         MOSS
            That's right.

                         AARONOW
            Why are you doing this to me, Dave.
            Why are you talking this way to me?
            I don't understand.  Why are you
            doing this at all...?

                         MOSS
            That's none of your fucking
            business...

                                                           32.


                         AARONOW
            Well, well, well, talk to me, we
            sat down to eat dinner, and here
            I'm a criminal...

                         MOSS
            You went for it.

                         AARONOW
            In the abstract...

                         MOSS
            So I'm making it concrete.

                         AARONOW
            Why?

                         MOSS
            Why?  Why you going to give me five
            grand?

                         AARONOW
            Do you need five grand?

                         MOSS
            Is that what I just said?

                         AARONOW
            You need money?  Is that the...

                         MOSS
            Hey, hey, let's just keep it
            simple, what I need is not
            the...what do you need...?

                         AARONOW
            What is the five grand?
                   (pause)
            What is the, you said that we were
            going to split five...

                         MOSS
            I lied.
                   (pause)
            Alright?  My end is my business.
            Your end's twenty-five.  In or out.
            You tell me, you're out you take
            the consequences.

                         AARONOW
            I do?

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                                                           33.


Pause.

                         AARONOW
            And why is that?

                         MOSS
            Because you listened.

SCENE THREE

The restaurant.  Roma is seated alone at the booth.  Lingk
is at the booth next to him.  Roma is talking to him.

                         ROMA
            ...all train compartments smell
            vaguely of shit.  It gets so you
            don't mind it.  That's the worst
            thing that I can confess.  You know
            how long it took me to get there?
            A long time.  When you die you're
            going to regret the things you
            don't do.  You think you're queer...?
            I'm going to tell you something:
            we're all queer.  You think that
            you're a thief?  So what?  You get
            befuddled by a middle-class
            morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut
            it out.  You cheated on your
            wife...?  You did it, live with it.
                   (pause)
            You fuck little girls, so be it.
            There's an absolute morality?  May
            be.  And then what?  If you think
            there is, then be that thing.  Bad
            people go to hell?  I don't think
            so.  If you think that, act that
            way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes.
            I won't live in it.  That's me.
            You ever take a dump made you feel
            you'd just slept for twelve hours...?

                         LINGK
            Did I...?

            Or a piss...?  A great meal fades
            in reflection.  Everything else
            gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's
            only food.  This shit we eat, it
            keeps us going.  But it's only food.

            orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on
            your neck, something her eyes did.
            There was a sound she made...or,
            me, lying, in the, I'll tell you:
            me lying in bed; the next day she
            brought me café au lait.  She gives
            me a cigarette, my balls feel like

            That's a trap.  There is no measure.
            Only greed.  How can we act?

            The right way, we would say, to
            deal with this: "There is a one-in-
            a-million chance that so and so
            will happen...Fuck it, it won't
            happen to me..." No.  We know
            that's not the right way I think.
                   (pause)
            We say the correct way to deal with
            this is "There is a one-in-so-and-
            so chance this will happen...God
            protect me.  I am powerless, let it
            not happen to me..." But no to that.
            I say.  There's something else.
            What is it? "If it happens, AS IT
            MAY for that is not within our
            powers, I will deal with it, just
            as I do today with what draws my
            concern today." I say this is how
            we must act.  I do those things
            which seem correct to me today.  I
            trust myself.  And if security
            concerns me, I do that which today
            I think will make me secure.  And
            every day I do that, when that day
            arrives that I need a reserve, [a]
            odds are that I have it, and [b]
            the true reserve that I have is the
            strength that I have of acting each
            day without fear.

            An opportunity.  To what?  To make

            Perhaps.  To "indulge" and to
            "learn" about ourselves?  Perhaps.

                         LEVENE
            What Roma's trying to tell you.
            What I told you yesterday.  Why you
            don't belong in this business.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Why I don't...

                         LEVENE
            You listen to me, someday you might
            say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you
            just listen what I'm going to say:
            your partner depends on you.  Your
            partner...a man who's your "partner"
            depends on you...you have to go
            with him and for him...or you're
            shit, you're shit, you can't exist
            alone...

                         WILLIAMSON
                   (brushing past him)
            Excuse me...

                         LEVENE
            ...excuse me, nothing, you be as
            cold as you want, but you just
            fucked a good man out of six
            thousand dollars and his goddamn
            bonus 'cause you didn't know the
            shot, if you can do that and you
            aren't man enough that it gets you,
            then I don't know what, if you
            can't take some thing from that...
                   (blocking his way)
            you're scum, you're fucking white-
            bread.  You be as cold as you want.
            A child would know it, he's right.
                   (pause)
            You're going to make something up,
            be sure it will help or keep your
            mouth closed.

Pause.

                                                           84.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Mmm.

Levene lifts up his arm.

                         LEVENE
            Now I'm done with you.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            How do you know I made it up?

                         LEVENE
                   (pause)
            What?

                         WILLIAMSON
            How do you know I made it up?

                         LEVENE
            What are you talking about?

                         WILLIAMSON
            You said, "You don't make something
            up unless it's sure to help."
                   (pause)
            How did you know that I made it up?

                         LEVENE
            What are you talking about?

                         WILLIAMSON
            I told the customer that his
            contracts had gone to the bank.

                         LEVENE
            Well, hadn't it?

                         WILLIAMSON
            No.
                   (pause)
            It hadn't.

                         LEVENE
            Don't fuck with me, John, don't
            fuck with me...what are you saying?

                                                           85.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Well, I'm saying this, Shel:
            usually I take the contracts to the
            bank.  Last night I didn't.  How
            did you know that?  One night in a
            year I left a contract on my desk.
            Nobody knew that but you.  Now how
            did you know that?
                   (pause)
            You want to talk to me, you want to
            talk to someone else...because this
            is my job.  This is my job on the
            line, and you are going to talk to
            me.  Now how did you know that
            contract was on my desk?

                         LEVENE
            You're so full of shit.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You robbed the office.

                         LEVENE
                   (laughs)
            Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What'd you do with the leads?
                   (pause, points to the
                   Detective's room)
            You want to go in there?  I tell
            him what I know, he's going to dig
            up something...You got an alibi
            last night?  You better have one.
            What did you do with the leads?  If
            you tell me what you did with the
            leads, we can talk.

                         LEVENE
            I don't know what you are saying.

                         WILLIAMSON
            If you tell me where the leads are,
            I won't turn you in.  If you don't,
            I am going to tell the cop you
            stole them, Mitch and Murray will
            see that you go to jail.  Believe
            me they will.  Now, what did you do
            with the leads?  I'm walking in
            that door--you have five seconds to
            tell me: or you are going to jail.

                         LEVENE
            I...

                                                           86.


                         WILLIAMSON
            I don't care.  You understand?
            Where are the leads?
                   (pause)
            Alright.

Williamson goes to open the office door.

                         LEVENE
            I sold them to Jerry Graff.

                         WILLIAMSON
            How much did you get for them?
                   (pause)
            How much did you get for them?

                         LEVENE
            Five thousand.  I kept half.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Who kept the other half?

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Do I have to tell you?
                   (pause, Williamson
                   starts to open the door)
            Moss.

                         WILLIAMSON
            That was easy, wasn't it?

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            It was his idea.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Was it?

                         LEVENE
            I...I'm sure he got more than the
            five, actually.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Uh-huh?

                         LEVENE
            He told me my share was twenty-five.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Mmm.

                                                           87.


                         LEVENE
            Okay: I...look: I'm going to make
            it worth your while.  I am.  I
            turned this thing around.  I closed
            the old stuff, I can do it again.
            I'm the one's going to close 'em.
            I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this
            thing a...I can do that, I can do
            anyth...last night.  I'm going to
            tell you, I was ready to Do the
            Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this,
            we'll get well..." Why not.  Big
            fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping
            to get caught.  To put me out of
            my...
                   (pause)
            But it taught me something.  What
            it taught me, that you've got to
            get out there.  Big deal.  So I
            wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I
            was cut out to be a salesman.  And
            now I'm back, and I got my balls
            back...and, you know, John, you
            have the advantage on me now:
            Whatever it takes to make it right,
            we'll make it right.  We're going
            to make it right.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I want to tell you something,
            Shelly.  You have a big mouth.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            What?

                         WILLIAMSON
            You've got a big mouth, and now I'm
            going to show you an even bigger
            one.
                   (starts toward the
                   Detective's door)


                         LEVENE
            Where are you going, John?...you
            can't do that, you don't want to do
            that...hold, hold on...hold on...

            No, I don't think so, Shel.

                         LEVENE
            I...

                         WILLIAMSON
            No, I think I don't want your money.
            I think you fucked up my office.
            And I think you're going away.

            I'm going to give you twenty
            percent of my sales...
                   (pause)
            Twenty percent.
                   (pause)
            For as long as I am with the firm.

            Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What sales?

                                                           89.

            they used to call in every week.
            When I was with Webb.  And we were
            selling Arizona...they're nuts...did
            you see how they were living?  How

                   (pause)
            The people are insane.  They just
            like talking to salesmen.

Williamson starts for door.

                         LEVENE
            Don't.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I'm sorry.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Because I don't like you.

                         LEVENE

            were slinging on my guy today was
            so good...it...it was, and, excuse
            me, 'cause it isn't even my place
            to say it.  It was admirable...it
            was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been
            on a hot streak, so what?  There's
            things that I could learn from you.
            You eat today?

                         LEVENE
            Me.

                         ROMA
            Yeah.

                         LEVENE
            Mm.

                         ROMA
            Well, you want to swing by the
            Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?

                         LEVENE
            I think I'd better stay here for a
            while.

Baylen sticks his head out of the room:

                         BAYLEN
            Mr. Levene...?

                         ROMA
            You're done, come down, and let's...

                         BAYLEN
            Would you come in here, please?

                         ROMA
            And let's put this together.  Okay?
            Shel?  Say okay.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
                   (softly to himself)
            Huh.

                                                           92.


                         BAYLEN
            Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.

                         ROMA
            I'm going to the Chinks.  You're
            done, come down, we're going to
            smoke a cigarette.

                         LEVENE
            I...

                         BAYLEN
                   (comes over)
            ...Get in the room.

                         ROMA
            Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's
            the "Machine." That is Shelly "The
            Machine" Lev...

                         BAYLEN
            Get in the goddamn room.

Baylen starts manhandling Shelly into the room.

                         LEVENE
            Ricky, I...

                         ROMA
            Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...

                         LEVENE
            Ricky...

                         BAYLEN
            "Ricky" can't help you, pal.

                         LEVENE
            ...I only want to...

                         BAYLEN
            Yeah.  What do you want?  You want
            to what?

He pushes Levene into the room, closes the door behind him.
Pause.

                         ROMA
            Williamson: listen to me: when the
            leads come in...listen to me: when

            mine, whatever he gets for himself,

                         WILLIAMSON
            Mmm.

                         AARONOW
            Did they find the guy who broke
            into the office yet?

            No.  I don't know.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Did the leads come in yet?

                         ROMA
            No.

                         AARONOW
                   (settling into a desk chair)
            Oh, God, I hate this job.

                         ROMA
                   (simultaneous with

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
	background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
	simple words in white lettering:

				  THE GODFATHER

	While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."
	Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
	man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
	emotion.

				BONASERA
		America has made my fortune.

	As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

				BONASERA
		I raised my daughter in the American
		fashion; I gave her freedom, but
		taught her never to dishonor her
		family.  She found a boy friend,
		not an Italian.  She went to the
		movies with him, stayed out late.
		Two months ago he took her for a
		drive, with another boy friend.
		They made her drink whiskey and
		then they tried to take advantage
		of her.  She resisted; she kept her
		honor.  So they beat her like an
		animal.  When I went to the hospital
		her nose was broken, her jaw was
		shattered and held together by
		wire, and she could not even weep
		because of the pain.

	He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

				BONASERA
		I went to the Police like a good
		American.  These two boys were
		arrested and brought to trial.  The
		judge sentenced them to three years
		in prison, and suspended the
		sentence.  Suspended sentence!
		They went free that very day.  I
		stood in the courtroom like a fool,
		and those bastards, they smiled at
		me.  Then I said to my wife, for
		Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

	By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
	in his home.

	The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
	patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the
	shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small
	table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
	impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
	glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
	voices of many people outside.

				DON CORLEONE
		Bonasera, we know each other for
		years, but this is the first time
		you come to me for help.  I don't
		remember the last time you invited
		me to your house for coffee...even
		though our wives are friends.

				BONASERA
		What do you want of me?  I'll give
		you anything you want, but do what
		I ask!

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is that Bonasera?

	BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  You ask for too much.

				BONASERA
		I ask for Justice.

				DON CORLEONE
		The Court gave you justice.

				BONASERA
		An eye for an eye!

				DON CORLEONE
		But your daughter is still alive.

				BONASERA
		Then make them suffer as she
		suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

	Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

				DON CORLEONE
		You never think to protect yourself
		with real friends.  You think it's
		enough to be an American.  All
		right, the Police protects you,
		there are Courts of Law, so you
		don't need a friend like me.
		But now you come to me and say Don
		Corleone, you must give me justice.
		And you don't ask in respect or
		friendship.  And you don't think to
		call me Godfather; instead you come
		to my house on the day my daughter
		is to be married and you ask me to
		do murder...for money.

				BONASERA
		America has been good to me...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then take the justice from the
		judge, the bitter with the sweet,
		Bonasera.  But if you come to me
		with your friendship, your loyalty,
		then your enemies become my enemies,
		and then, believe me, they would
		fear you...

	Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

				BONASERA
		Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

				BONASERA
		Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Some day, and that day may never
		come, I would like to call upon you
		to do me a service in return.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There
	are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
	and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and
	countless tables covered with food and wine.

	DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
	son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
	the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
	hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
	children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry
	with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
	bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

	The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
	MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
	and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
	bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into
	the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

				DON CORLEONE
		Where's Michael?

				SONNY
		He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

				DON CORLEONE
		Then the picture will wait for him.

	Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
	back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
	direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns
	it.  Then he moves to his wife.

				SONNY
		Sandra, watch the kids.  They're
		running wild.

				SANDRA
		You watch yourself.

	HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
	barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM
	crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
	next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

	EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
	working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
	of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
	down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter
	coming from the party in the distance.

	A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

	BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
	watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
	embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
	bumpers.

	PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
	bellies with the ladies.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie...wine...WINE.

	He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
	PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
	it to him.

				PAULIE
		You look terrif on the floor!

				CLEMENZA
		What are you, a dance judge?  Go do
		your job; take a walk around the
		neighborhood... see everything is
		okay.

	PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
	back into the dance.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.

	TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
	OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
	enormous brown shoes.

	The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
	of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
	CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Buddy, this is a private party.

	The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
	sedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
	The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
	without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the
	ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
	and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the
	walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
	dark study.

				NAZORINE
		...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
		by the American Army, and sent to
		New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

				DON CORLEONE
		Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I
		can do.

				NAZORINE
		Now that the war is over, Enzo,
		this boy is being repatriated to
		Italy.  And you see, Godfather...
			  (he wrings his hands,
			  unable to express himself)
		He...my daughter...they...

				DON CORLEONE
		You want him to stay in this country.

				NAZORINE
		Godfather, you understand everything.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, what we need is an Act of
		Congress to allow Enzo to become a
		citizen.

				NAZORINE
			  (impressed)
		An Act of Congress!

				HAGEN
			  (nodding)
		It will cost.

	The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
	nods.

				NAZORINE
		Is that all?  Godfather, thank
		you...
			  (backing out, enthusiastically)
		Oh, wait till you see the cake I
		made for your beautiful daughter!

	NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
	DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

				HAGEN
		Who do I give this job to?

	The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

				DON CORLEONE
		Not to one of our paisans...give it
		to a Jew Congressman in another
		district.  Who else is on the list
		for today?

	The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
	to see him.

				HAGEN
		Francesco Nippi.  His nephew has
		been refused parole.  A bad case.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		His father worked with you in the
		freight yards when you were young.

	LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		He's not on the list, but Luca
		Brasi wants to see you.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is it necessary?

				HAGEN
		You understand him better than
		anyone.

	The DON nods to this.  Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
	leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
	stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
	following them.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
	her to his GIRL.

	EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
	burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She
	is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
	the vitality.

				KAY
		I've never seen anything like it.

				MICHAEL
		I told you I had a lot of relatives.

	KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
	We see what she sees:

	Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
	barrels.

				KAY
			  (amused)
		Michael, what are those men doing?

				MICHAEL
		They're waiting to see my father.

				KAY
		They're talking to themselves.

				MICHAEL
		They're going to talk to my father,
		which means they're going to ask
		him for something, which means they
		better get it right.

				KAY
		Why do they bother him on a day
		like this?

				MICHAEL
		Because they know that no Sicilian
		will refuse a request on his
		daughter's wedding day.

	EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

	CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
	overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He
	is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
	She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
	him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
	envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
	holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
	of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
	where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
	CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
	bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
	things hold.

	Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

				CARLO
			  (whispered)
		Cut it out, Connie.

	The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
	is fat with money.

				PAULIE (O.S.)
		What do you think?  Twenty grand?

	A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
	prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
	eyes from the purse.

				PAULIE
		Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty,
		thirty grand in small bills cash in
		that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if
		this was somebody else's wedding!

	SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
	MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he
	glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
	some WOMEN.

	He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

	SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

				WOMAN
		Is it true what they say about your
		husband, Sandra?

	SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
	further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
	Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
	SONNY and LUCY are gone.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

	The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY
	surreptitiously steps out.

	She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
	motioning for her to come up.

	She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL.

				KAY
			  (in a spooky low tone)
		Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a
		relative?

	She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

				MICHAEL
		No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You
		wouldn't like him.

				KAY
			  (Excited)
		Who is he?

				MICHAEL
			  (Sizing her up)
		You really want to know?

				KAY
		Yes.  Tell me.

				MICHAEL
		You like spaghetti?

				KAY
		You know I love spaghetti.

				MICHAEL
		Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
		tell you a Luca Brasi story.

	She starts to eat her spaghetti.

	She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

				MICHAEL
		Once upon a time, about fifteen
		years ago some people wanted to
		take over my father's olive oil
		business.  They had Al Capone send
		some men in from Chicago to kill my
		father, and they almost did.

				KAY
		Al Capone!

				MICHAEL
		My Father sent Luca Brasi after
		them.  He tied the two Capone men
		hand and foot, and stuffed small
		bath towels into their mouths.
		Then he took an ax, and chopped one
		man's feet off...

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		Then the legs at the knees...

				KAY
		Michael you're trying to scare me...

				MICHAEL
		Then the thighs where they joined
		the torso.

				KAY
		Michael, I don't want to hear
		anymore...

				MICHAEL
		Then Luca turned to the other man...

				KAY
		Michael, I love you.

				MICHAEL
		...who out of sheer terror had
		swallowed the bath towel in his
		mouth and suffocated.

	The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
	tall story.

				KAY
		I never know when you're telling me
		the truth.

				MICHAEL
		I told you you wouldn't like him.

				KAY
		He's coming over here!

	LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
	their table.

				MICHAEL
		Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
		Adams.

				KAY
			  (having survived LUCA)
		How do you do.

				MICHAEL
		My brother, Tom Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Hello Kay.  Your father's inside,
		doing some business.
			  (privately)
		He's been asking for you.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks Tom.

	HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
	following.

				KAY
		If he's your brother, why does he
		have a different name?

				MICHAEL
		My brother Sonny found him living
		in the streets when he was a kid,
		so my father took him in.  He's a
		good lawyer.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the
	YOUNG COUPLE.

				LUCA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...

	THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
	forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his
	jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
	a formal speech.

				LUCA
			  (with difficulty)
		Don Corleone...I am honored, and
		grateful...that you invited me to
		your home...on the wedding day of
		your...daughter.
		May their first child...be a
		masculine child.  I pledge my never
		ending loyalty.
			  (he offers the envelope)
		For your daughter's bridal purse.

				DON CORLEONE
		Thank you, Luca, my most valued
		friend.

	THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
	tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

				LUCA
		Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I
		know you are busy.

	He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
	the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes
	more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'm sure it's the most generous
		gift today.

				HAGEN
		The Senator called--apologized for
		not coming personally, but said
		you'd understand.  Also, some of
		the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
		And another call from Virgil
		Sollozzo.

	DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

				HAGEN
		The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
		has contacts in Turkey for the
		poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
		process down to morphine or up to
		heroin.  Also he has access to this
		country.  He's coming to us for
		financial help, and some sort of
		immunity from the law.  For that we
		get a piece of the action, I
		couldn't find out how much.
		Sollozzo is vouched for by the
		Tattaglia family, and they may have
		a piece of the action.  They call
		Sollozzo the Turk.
		He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
		and is suppose to have a Turkish
		wife and kids.  He's suppose to be
		very quick with the knife, or was,
		when he was younger.  Only in
		matters of business and with some
		reasonable complaint.  Also he has
		an American wife and three children
		and he is a good family man.

	THE DON nods.

				HAGEN
		He's his own boss, and very
		competent.

				DON CORLEONE
		And with prison record.

				HAGEN
		Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
		United States.  He's known to the
		Government as a top narcotics man.
		That could be a plus for us; he
		could never get immunity to testify.

				DON CORLEONE
		When did he call?

				HAGEN
		This morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		On a day like this.  Consiglero, do
		you also have in your notes the the
		Turk made his living from
		Prostitution before the war, like
		the Tattaglias do now.  Write that
		down before you forget it.  The
		Turk will wait.

	We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
	from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.

				DON CORLEONE
		What that?  It sounds like Johnny.

	He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
	room with light.

				DON CORLEONE
		It is Johnny.  He came all the way
		from California to be at the wedding.

				HAGEN
		Should I bring him in.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You
		see?  He is a good godson.

				HAGEN
		It's been two years.  He's probably
		in trouble again.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
	excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

				KAY
		I didn't know your family knew
		Johnny Fontane.

				MICHAEL
		Sure.

				KAY
		I used to come down to New York
		whenever he sang at the Capitol and
		scream my head off.

				MICHAEL
		He's my father's godson; he owes
		him his whole career.

	JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
	They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

				DON CORLEONE
		My Godson has come three thousand
		miles to do us honor and no one
		thinks to wet his throat.

	At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
	takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

				JOHNNY
		I kept trying to call you after my
		divorce and Tom always said you
		were busy.  When I got the Wedding
		invitation I knew you weren't sore
		at me anymore, Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Can I do something for you still?
		You're not too rich, or too famous
		that I can't help you?

				JOHNNY
		I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
		and...my career, I'm almost washed
		up...

	He's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come
	with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to
	HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Santino to come in with us.
		He should hear some things.

	They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN glances up the staircase.

				HAGEN
		Sonny?

	Then he goes up.

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
	gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
	against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of
	petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

				LUCY
		Sonnyeeeeeeee.

	Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his
	body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze
	in that position.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, you in there?

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside, HAGEN by the door.

				HAGEN
		The old man wants you; Johnny's
		here...he's got a problem.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		Okay.  One minute.

	HAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the
	door again.  TOM leaves.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

				DON CORLEONE
		ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in
		Heaven, is it possible you turned
		out no better than a Hollywood
		finocchio.

	Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON
	smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
	adjusting his clothes.

				DON CORLEONE
		All right, Hollywood...Now tell me
		about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
		who won't let you work.

				JOHNNY
		He owns the studio.  Just a month
		ago he bought the movie rights to
		this book, a best seller.  And the
		main character is a guy just like
		me.  I wouldn't even have to act,
		just be myself.

	The DON is silent, stern.

				DON CORLEONE
		You take care of your family?

				JOHNNY
		Sure.

	He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
	he can.

				DON CORLEONE
		You look terrible.  I want you to
		eat well, to rest.  And spend time
		with your family.  And then, at the
		end of the month, this big shot
		will give you the part you want.

				JOHNNY
		It's too late.  All the contracts
		have been signed, they're almost
		ready to shoot.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
	to hurt.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now go back to the party and leave
		it to me.

	He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		When does my daughter leave with
		her bridegroom?

				HAGEN
		They'll cut the cake in a few
		minutes...leave right after that.
		Your new son-in-law, do we give him
		something important?

				DON CORLEONE
		No, give him a living.  But never
		let him know the family's business.
		What else, Tom?

				HAGEN
		I've called the hospital; they've
		notified Consiglere Genco's family
		to come and wait.  He won't last
		out the night.

	This saddens the DON.  He sighs.

				DON CORLEONE
		Genco will wait for me.  Santino,
		tell your brothers they will come
		with me to the hospital to see
		Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big
		car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

				SONNY
		And Michael?

				DON CORLEONE
		All my sons.
			  (to HAGEN)
		Tom, I want you to go to California
		tonight.  Make the arrangements.
		But don't leave until I come back
		from the hospital and speak to you.
		Understood?

				HAGEN
		Understood.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
	the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
	in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
	extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
	of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
	begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
	in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
	kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks
	hitting five hundred glasses.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Silence.

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A
	single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the
	driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
	sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

				DON CORLEONE
		Will your girl friend get back to
		the city all right?

				MICHAEL
		Tom said he'd take care of it.

	The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
	the gate of the great Corleone Mall.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

	A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
	see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
	all plump and dressed in black.

	DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the
	DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL
	stops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one
	another for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts
	his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
	uniform.

				DON CORLEONE
		What was this for?

				MICHAEL
		For bravery.

				DON CORLEONE
		And this?

				MICHAEL
		For killing a man.

				DON CORLEONE
		What miracles you do for strangers.

				MICHAEL
		I fought for my country.  It was my
		choice.

				DON CORLEONE
		And now, what do you choose to do?

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to finish school.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  When you are finished, come
		and talk to me.  I have hopes for
		you.

	Again they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,
	and continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
	follows.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
	VIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (whispered)
		Genco, I've brought my sons to pay
		their respects.  And look, even
		Johnny Fontane, all the way from
		Hollywood.

	GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE
	takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
	his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

				GENCO
		Godfather, Godfather, it's your
		daughter's wedding day, you cannot
		refuse me.  Cure me, you have the
		power.

				DON CORLEONE
		I have no such power...but Genco,
		don't fear death.

				GENCO
			  (with a sly wink)
		It's been arranged, then?

				DON CORLEONE
		You blaspheme.  Resign yourself.

				GENCO
		You need your old Consigliere.  Who
		will replace me?
			  (suddenly)
		Stay with me Godfather.  Help me
		meet death.  If he sees you, he
		will be frightened and leave me in
		peace.  You can say a word, pull a
		few strings, eh?  We'll outwit that
		bastard as we outwitted all those
		others.
			  (clutching his hand)
		Godfather, don't betray me.

	The DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.
	He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
	whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	FADE IN:

	The interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of
	the very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like
	any young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the
	difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
	during the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,
	bulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.

	INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

	The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his
	undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
	envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
	contents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
	bathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
	tries to get his interest.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE in his office.  LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Luca, I am worried about this man
		Sollozzo.  Find out what you can,
		through the Tattaglias.  Let them
		believe you could be tempted away
		from the Corleone Family, if the
		right offer was made.  Learn what
		he has under his fingernails...

	INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

	The hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs
	two steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
	him into the apartment.

	INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI's tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels
	and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
	trunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
	vest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
	puts on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly
	disassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

	INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New
	Hampshire.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty
	subway train.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN on the Constellation.  He reaches into his briefcase,
	and takes out several pictures and papers.

	One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm
	in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a
	lovely young child star to his immediate right.

	HAGEN considers other papers.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
	He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

				DON CORLEONE
		Remember my new Consigliere, a
		lawyer with his briefcase can steal
		more than a hundred men with guns.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

	JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
	armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,
	and TOM enters.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
	gardens, martinis in hand.

				WOLTZ
		You should have told me your boss
		was Corleone, Tom, I had to check
		you out.  I thought you were just
		some third rate hustler Johnny was
		running in to bluff me.
			  (a piece of statuary)
		Florence, thirteenth century.
		Decorated the garden of a king.

	They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

				WOLTZ
		I'm going to show you something
		beautiful.

	They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
	huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."
	TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
	rise as WOLTZ approaches.

				WOLTZ
		You like horses?  I like horses, I
		love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive
		Racehorses.

	The animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him
	with true love in his voice.

				WOLTZ
		Khartoum...Kartoum...You are
		looking at six hundred thousand
		dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even
		Russian Czars never paid that kind
		of dough for a single horse.  But
		I'm not going to race him I'm going
		to put him out to Stud.

	INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
	attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the
	walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

				HAGEN
		Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
		That is very close, a very sacred
		religious relationship.

				WOLTZ
		Okay, but just tell him this is one
		favor I can't give.  But he should
		try me again on anything else.

				HAGEN
		He never asks a second favor when
		he has been refused the first.
		Understood?

				WOLTZ
		You smooth son of a bitch, let me
		lay it on the line for you, and
		your boss.  Johnny Fontane never
		gets that movie.  I don't care how
		many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball
		Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

				HAGEN
		I'm German-Irish.

				WOLTZ
		Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny
		will never get that part because I
		hate that pinko punk and I'm going
		to run him out of the Movies.  And
		I'll tell you why.  He ruined one
		of Woltz Brothers' most valuable
		proteges.  For five years I had
		this girl under training; singing
		lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing
		lessons!  We spent hundreds of
		thousands of dollars--I was going
		to make her a star.  I'll be even
		more frank, just to show you that
		I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
		wasn't all dollars and cents.  That
		girl was beautiful and young and
		innocent and she was the greatest
		piece of ass I've ever ad and I've
		had them all over the world.  Then
		Johnny comes along with that olive
		oil voice and guinea charm and she
		runs off.  She threw it all away to
		make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN
		MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
		MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

	EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

	An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
	Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
	INC." next to an open-faced fruit market.

	A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
	cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
	the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
	before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very
	dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,
	and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of
	the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
	introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of
	handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
	introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
	glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
	They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are
	brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
	in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
	CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish
	with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
	one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
	that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

				SOLLOZZO
		My business is heroin, I have poppy
		fields, laboratories in Narseilles
		and Sicily, ready to go into
		production.  My importing methods
		are as safe as these things can be,
		about five per cent loss.  The risk
		is nothing, the profits enormous.

				DON CORLEONE
		Why do you come to me?  Why do I
		deserve your generosity?

				SOLLOZZO
		I need two million dollars in
		cash...more important, I need a
		friend who has people in high
		places; a friend who can guarantee
		that if one of my employees be
		arrested, they would get only light
		sentences.  Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		What percentages for my family?

				SOLLOZZO
		Thirty per cent.  In the first year
		your share would be four million
		dollars; then it would go up.

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is the percentage of the
		Tattaglia family?

	SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		My compliments.  I'll take care of
		them from my share.

				DON CORLEONE
		So.  I receive 30 per cent just for
		finance and legal protection.  No
		worries about operations, is that
		what you tell me?

				SOLLOZZO
		If you think two million dollars in
		cash is just finance, I congratulate
		you Don Corleone.

	There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
	the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		I said I would see you because I've
		heard you're a serious man, to be
		treated with respect...
			  (pause)
		But I'll say no to you.

	We feel this around the room.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll give you my reasons.  I have
		many, many friends in Politics.
		But they wouldn't be so friendly if
		my business was narcotics instead
		of gambling.  They think gambling
		is something like liquor, a harmless
		vice...and they think narcotics is
		dirty business.

	SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

				DON CORLEONE
		No...how a man makes his living is
		none of my business.  But this
		proposition of yours is too risky.
		All the people in my family lived
		well the last ten years, I won't
		risk that out of greed.

				SOLLOZZO
		Are you worried about security for
		your million?

				DON CORLEONE
		No.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Tattaglias will guarantee your
		investment also.

	This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

				SONNY
		The Tattaglia family guarantees our
		investment?

	SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
	him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
	of line.

				DON CORLEONE
		Young people are greedy, and they
		have no manners.  They speak when
		they should listen.  But I have a
		sentimental weakness for my
		children, and I've spoiled them, as
		you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my
		no is final.

	SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He
	glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do
	as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
	takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

	The DON turns to SONNY.

				DON CORLEONE
		Santino, never let anyone outside
		the family know what you are
		thinking.  I think your brain is
		going soft from all that comedy you
		play with that young girl.

	TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
	with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.

				DON CORLEONE
		What is this nonsense?

				HAGEN
		It's from Johnny.  It was announced
		this morning.  He's going to play
		the lead in the new Woltz Brothers
		film.

	INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
	presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room
	from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see
	his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;
	mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something
	wet.

	He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
	He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is
	frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
	his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of
	blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,
	moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
	with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
	his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy
	tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
	of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and
	the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
	with blood.

	WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.
	Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
	terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
	knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Send Johnny my congratulations.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

	Fifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are
	bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

	KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,
	carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

				KAY
		We have something for your mother,
		for Sonny, we have the tie for
		Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the
		Reynolds pen...

				MICHAEL
		And what do you want for Christmas?

				KAY
		Just you.

	They kiss.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS
	AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony
		at the City Hall, no big fuss, no
		family, just a couple of friends as
		witnesses.

	The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on
	the two single beds that they have pushed together.

				KAY
		What will your father say?

				MICHAEL
		As long as I tell him beforehand he
		won't object.  He'll be hurt, but
		he won't object.

				KAY
		What time do they expect us?

				MICHAEL
		For dinner.  Unless I call and tell
		them we're still in New Hampshire.

				KAY
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		Then we can have dinner, see a
		show, and spend one more night.

	He moves to the telephone.

				MICHAEL (CONT'D.)
		Operator.  Get me
			  (fill in number)


				KAY
		Michael, what are you doing?

				MICHAEL
		Shhh, you be the long distance
		operator.  Here.

				KAY
		Hello...this is Long Distance.  I
		have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr.
		Michael Corleone.  One moment please.

	She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

				MICHAEL
		Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah...
		listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm
		driving down to the city with Kay
		tomorrow morning.  There's something
		important I want to tell the old
		man before Christmas.  Will he be
		home tomorrow night?

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background,
	through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in
	his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sure.  Anything I can do for you.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas.
		Everyone's going to be out at Long
		Beach, right?

				HAGEN
		Right.

	He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of
	work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and
	hat, and continues out.

	He peeks into the DON's office.

				HAGEN
		Michael called; he's not leaving
		New Hampshire until tomorrow
		morning.  I've got to go, I promised
		Theresa I'd pick up some toys for
		the kids.

	The DON smiles and nods.

	TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
	FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the
	afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office
	manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,
	raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
	paper.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Paulie to get the car from the
		lot; I'll be ready to go home in a
		few minutes.

				FREDO
		I'll have to get it myself; Paulie
		called in sick this morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		That's the third time this month.
		I think maybe you'd better get a
		healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell
		Tom.

				FREDO
			  (going)
		Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick,
		he's sick.  I don't mind getting
		the car.

	FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out
	his window.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	FREDDIE crosses the street.

	INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

				OFFICE MANAGER
		Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

	The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the
	DON glances out his window.

	The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

				DON CORLEONE
		Merry Christmas.
			  (handing the MANAGER
			  an envelope)


	And he starts down the stairs.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When
	FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the
	driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to
	get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
	fruit stand near the corner.

	The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among
	the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
	piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
	pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON
	pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
	turns back to the car.

	EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

	TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift
	wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks,
	someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO.

	He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (quietly)
		Don't be frightened.  I just want
		to talk to you.

	A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (urgently)
		Get in; I want to talk to you.

	HAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened.

				HAGEN
		I haven't got time.

	TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

				SOLLOZZO
		Get in the car.  If I wanted to
		kill you you'd be dead already.
		Trust me.

	HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving
	our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story
	of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the
	car drive off.

	EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

	RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and
	MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and
	she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY
	nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk
	arm in arm.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		a nun?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		Ingrid Bergman?

	They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees
	something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do.
	MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

				KAY
			  (a little voice)
		Michael?

				MICHAEL
		I'm thinking about it.

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		No, I would not like you better if
		you were Ingrid Bergman.

	She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm,
	back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave.

	The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
	DOWN."

	MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a
	dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY
	knows to remain silent.

				MICHAEL
			  (desperately)
		They don't say if he's dead or alive.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the
	car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON
	drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness
	toward the parked car.

				DON CORLEONE
		Fredo, Fredo!

	The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
	rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

	Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,
	and continues toward the car.

	The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
	over an entire case of fruit.

	The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

	Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are
	more GUNSHOTS.

	FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
	having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun
	trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops
	the gun.

	The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

	The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed
	DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
	and pools of blood are beginning to form.

	The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
	they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

	The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
	rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
	from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
	windows.  But the street itself is now empty.

	FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
	puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
	face down in them.

	FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
	something we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.  He
	gets off.

	He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

	EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA walks down the late night street.  He approaches an
	elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still
	winking this late at night.  He waits and watches.  Then the
	sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

	INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
	glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the
	chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
	is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
	receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
	the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
	behind the bar.

				MAN
		Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

				LUCA
		I know.

	LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

				SOLLOZZO
		Do you know who I am?

	LUCA Nods.

				SOLLOZZO
		You've been talking to the
		Tattaglias.  They thought we could
		do business.

	LUCA listens.

				SOLLOZZO
		I need somebody strong to protect
		my operation, physically.  I've
		heard you're not happy with your
		family, you might make a switch.

				LUCA
		If the money is good enough.

				SOLLOZZO
		On the first shipment, I can
		guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

	LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

	SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
	rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
	BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
	magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then,
	he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
	puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

	INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.  He approaches
	it, obviously fresh from a nap.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you recognize my voice?

				SONNY
		I think so.  Detective squad?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Right.  Don't say my name, just
		listen.  Somebody shot your father
		outside his place fifteen minutes
		ago.

				SONNY
		Is he alive?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I think so, but I can't get close
		enough.  There's a lot of blood.
		I'll try to find out more.

				SONNY
		Find out anything you can...you got
		a Grand coming.
			  (click)


	SONNY cradles the phone.  An incredible rage builds up in
	him, his face actually turning red.  He would like to rip
	the phone to pieces in his bare hands.  Then he controls it.
	Quickly, he dials another number.

				SONNY
		Theresa, let me talk to Tom.  Not
		yet?  Have him call me as soon as
		he gets home.

	He hangs up.

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, who is it?
			  (she enters the room)
		What is it?

				SONNY
			  (calmly)
		They shot the old man.

				SANDRA
		Oh God...

				SONNY
		Honey...don't worry.  Nothing else
		is going to happen.

	There is a POUNDING on the door.  A BABY starts crying.

				SANDRA
			  (really frightened)
		SONNY?

	SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and
	moves quickly.  He opens the front door quickly.  It is
	CLEMENZA.  He enters, SONNY closes the door.  SANDRA goes to
	look after the baby.

				CLEMENZA
			  (excited)
		You heard about your father?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		The word is out in the streets that
		he's dead.

				SONNY
		Where the hell was Paulie, why
		wasn't he with the Don?

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie's been a little sick all
		winter...he was home.

				SONNY
		How many times did he stay home the
		last couple of months?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe three, four times.  I always
		asked Freddie if he wanted another
		bodyguard, but he said no.  Things
		have been so smooth the last ten
		years...

				SONNY
		Go get Paulie, I don't care how
		sick he is.  Pick him up yourself,
		and bring him to my father's house.

				CLEMENZA
		That's all?  Don't you want me to
		send some people over here?

				SONNY
		No, just you and Paulie.

	CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the
	couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

				SONNY
		A couple of our people will come to
		stay here.  Do whatever they say;
		I'm going over to the main house.
		If you want me, use Pop's special
		phone.

	The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it.

				SONNY
		Hello.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		Santino Corleone?

	SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY
	indicates that she be quiet.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		We have Tom Hagen.  In about three
		hours he'll be released with our
		proposition.  Don't do anything
		until you've heard what he has to
		say.  You can only cause a lot of
		trouble.  What's done is done.
			  (a pause)
		Don't lose that famous temper of
		yours.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		I'll wait.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the
	courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the
	tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure
	of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

	INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls
	out.

				SONNY
		Ma?  Ma, where are you.

	The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes
	her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm.

				SONNY
		Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's
		hurt...I don't know how bad.

				MAMA
			  (quietly)
		Santino?  Have they killed him?

				SONNY
			  (almost in tears)
		We don't know yet, Ma.

				MAMA
		I'll get dressed.  In case we can
		see him...

	She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY
	turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He
	takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,
	and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his
	father's office.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	He switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive
	desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the
	telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,
	and dials a number.

				SONNY
		Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
		I want fifty reliable men out here.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		I heard, Sonny...but what about
		Clemenza's regime?

				SONNY
		I don't want to use Clemenza's
		people right now.  Understood?

	He hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the
	dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the
	desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
	We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA
	BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer.

				SONNY
		Luca.

	INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

	The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits
	and ties sit around in the booths.

	HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

				SOLLOZZO
		I know you're not in the muscle end
		of the family--so I don't want you
		to be afraid.  I want you to help
		the Corleones and I want you to
		help me.

	HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette
	in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye
	to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered
	china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully.

				SOLLOZZO
		Your boss is dead...

	HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
	SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (pushing the bottle)
		Have some more.  We got him outside
		his office, just before I picked
		you up.  You have to make the peace
		between me and Santino.

	HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

				SOLLOZZO
		Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
		You know it's the smart thing to
		do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny
		into it.

				HAGEN
			  (pulling himself together)
		Sonny will come after you with
		everything he's got.

	SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

				SOLLOZZO
		That's going to be his first
		reaction.  You have to talk some
		sense into him.  The Tattaglia
		family stands behind me with all
		their people.  The other New York
		Families will go along with anything
		that prevents a full scale war.

	He leans close to HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Don was slipping; in the old
		days I could never have gotten to
		him.  Now he's dead, nothing can
		bring him back.  Talk to Sonny,
		talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza
		and Tessio...it's good business.

				HAGEN
		Even Sonny won't be able to call
		off Luca Brasi.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'll worry about Luca.  You take
		care of Sonny and the other two kids.

				HAGEN
		I'll try...It's what the Don would
		want us to do.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (lifting his hands in
			  an expression of harmlessness)
		Good...then you can go...
			  (he escorts him to
			  the door)
		I don't like violence.  I'm a
		businessman, and blood is a big
		expense.

	He opens the door; they step out together.

	EXT NITE: BUILDING

	HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

	But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
	He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to
	SOLLOZZO in private.

	Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the
	door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

				SOLLOZZO
		The old man is still alive.  Five
		bullets in his Sicilian hide and
		he's still alive.
			  (he gives a fatalistic
			  shrug)
		Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL driving during the night.  There is a little fog in
	the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making
	it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view,
	as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
	decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white
	floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The
	narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
	chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving
	cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
	chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

				MAN
		Who're you?

	ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and
	then turns.

				MAN 2
		It's the Don's kid; take the car,
		I'll bring him inside.

	The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

	INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

	The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL
	doesn't recognize.  They pay little attention to him.  Most
	of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas
	tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

	THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a
	cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water
	glass half filled with whiskey.  On the other side of the
	sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is
	sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black
	with his saliva.  PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the
	other side of the room.  CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Your mother's at the hospital with
		the old man: He's gonna pull through.

	MICHAEL nods his relief.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

	He moves to THERESA.

				MICHAEL
			  (gently)
		You heard from Tom yet?

	Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and
	trembles.  Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the
	room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

				MICHAEL
			  (taking her hand)
		C'mon.

	He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.  They look
	up, startled.

				SONNY
		Don't worry, Theresa; they just
		want to give Tom the proposition,
		then they're going to turn him loose.

	He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,
	he kisses him on the cheek.

				SONNY
		I was worried when we couldn't get
		in touch with you in that hick town.

				MICHAEL
		How's Mom?

				SONNY
		Good.  She's been through it before.
		Me too.  You were too young to know
		about it.  You better wait outside;
		there're some things you shouldn't
		hear.

				MICHAEL
		I can help you out...

				SONNY
		Oh no you can't, the old man'd be
		sore as hell if I let you get mixed
		up in this.

				MICHAEL
		Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

				SONNY
		Theresa.

	She understands, and leaves them alone.

				SONNY
		All right, Mikey...who do we have
		to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

				MICHAEL
		What?

				SONNY
		One of them fingered the old man.

	MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on
	trial for their lives.

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.

				SONNY
		You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
		It was Paulie.

				MICHAEL
		How can you be sure?

				SONNY
		On the three days Paulie was sick
		this month, he got calls from a
		payphone across from the old man's
		building.  We got people in the
		phone company.
			  (he shrugs)
		Thank God it was Paulie...we'll
		need Clemenza bad.

	MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the
	situation.

				MICHAEL
		Is it going to be all-out war, like
		last time?

				SONNY
		Until the old man tells me different.

				MICHAEL
		Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't
		care what it costs.  I don't care
		if we have to fight all the five
		families in New York.  The Tattaglia
		family's going to eat dirt.  I
		don't care if we all go down
		together.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		That's not how Pop would have
		played it.

				SONNY
		I know I'm not the man he was.  But
		I'll tell you this and he'll tell
		you too.  When it comes to real
		action, I can operate as good as
		anybody short range.

				MICHAEL
			  (calmly)
		All right, Sonny.  All right.

				SONNY
		Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

				MICHAEL
		Is it like they say?  Is he that
		good?

	Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
	Then open the door and rush out.

	Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped
	in a tight embrace with his WIFE.

				HAGEN
		If I plead before the Supreme
		Court, I'll never do better than I
		did tonight with that Turk.

	EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's
	study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on
	the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,
	in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the
	morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many
	snacks.  They can barely talk anymore.

				HAGEN
		Is the hospital covered?

				SONNY
		The cops have it locked in and I
		got my people there visiting Pop
		all the time.  What about the hit
		list.

	HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

				HAGEN
		Too much, too far, too personal.
		The Don would consider this all
		purely a business dispute: Get rid
		of Sollozzo, and everything falls
		in line.  YOU don't have to go
		after the Tattaglias.

	CLEMENZA nods.

				HAGEN
		What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't
		seem worried about Luca.  That
		worries me.

				SONNY
		If Luca sold out we're in real
		trouble.

				HAGEN
		Has anyone been able to get in
		touch with him?

				SONNY
		No, and I've been calling all night.
		Maybe he's shacked up.

				HAGEN
		Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
		He always goes home when he's
		through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's
		number.

	MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the
	number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the
	other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up.

				HAGEN
		Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
			  (exhausted)


				SONNY
		Tom, you're the Consigliere, what
		do we do if the old man dies?

				HAGEN
		Without your father's political
		contacts and personal influence,
		the Corleone family loses half its
		strength.  Without your father, the
		other New York families might wind
		up supporting Sollozzo, and the
		Tattaglias just to make sure there
		isn't a long destructive war.  The
		old days are over, this is 1946;
		nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If
		your father dies...make the deal,
		Sonny.

				SONNY
			  (angry)
		That's easy to say; it's not your
		father.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I was as good a son to him as you
		or Mike.

				SONNY
		Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it
		that way.

				HAGEN
		We're all tired...

				SONNY
		OK, we sit tight until the old man
		can give us the lead.  But Tom, I
		want you to stay inside the Mall.
		You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio,
		you hold your people in reserve,
		but have them nosing around the
		city.  The hospital is yours; I
		want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours
		a day.

	There is a timid knock on the door.

				SONNY
		What is it?

	PAULIE GATTO looks in.

				CLEMENZA
		I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

				PAULIE
		The guy at the gate's outside...says
		there's a package...

				SONNY
		Tessio, see what it is.

	TESSIO gets up, leaves.

				PAULIE
		You want me to hang around?

				SONNY
		Yeah.  Hang around.

				PAULIE
		Outside?

				CLEMENZA
		Outside.

				PAULIE
		Sure.

	He closes the door.

				SONNY
		Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie.
		I don't ever want to see him again.
		Understood?

				CLEMENZA
		Understood.

				SONNY
		Okay, now you can move your men
		into the Mall, replace Tessio's
		people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a
		couple of Clemenza's people and go
		to Luca's apartment and wait for
		him to show.  That crazy bastard
		might be going after Sollozzo right
		now if he's heard the news.

				HAGEN
		Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up
		in this so directly.  You know the
		old man doesn't want that.

				SONNY
		OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

	MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca
	Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one
	answers.

	TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest
	in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped
	inside.

				CLEMENZA
		A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi
		sleeps with the fishes.

	INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we
	remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
	LUCA looks up at him.

	Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
	LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
	clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is
	thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His
	face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
	purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
	far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes
	bulge.

	ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's
	strength leaves him.

				BRUNO
			  (making an ugly face)
		Oh Christ...all over the floor.

	SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his
	face.

	LUCA falls to the floor.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Godfather is next.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of
	pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A
	dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
	noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This
	is ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
	talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
	side of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
	specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
	washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.

				LAMPONE
		Nice.

				CLEMENZA
		Crazy Detroit delivered it with a
		wooden bumper.  They're going to
		send me the chrome bumpers in a
		couple months.  I waited two years
		for this car to come with wooden
		bumpers!

	He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

				CLEMENZA
		Today you make your bones on Paulie.
		You understand everything?

				LAMPONE
		Sure.

	As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
	unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

				CLEMENZA
		.22 soft-nosed load.  Accurate up
		to five feet.

	LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into
	the driveway, and he sounds the horn.

	The two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit
	nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in
	the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
	recognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
	to chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little
	when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

				PAULIE
		Rocco, sit on the other side.  A
		big guy like you blocks my rearview
		mirror.

	CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Goddamn Sonny.  He's running scared.
		He's already thinking of going to
		the mattresses.  We have to find a
		place on the West Side.  Paulie,
		you know a good location?

	PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
	he was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling
	Sollozzo any secret location.

				PAULIE
		I'll think about it.

				CLEMENZA
			  (grunting)
		Drive while you thinking; I wanna
		get to the City this month!

	The car pulls out.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

	Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump.  OUR
	VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
	light.

	INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
	He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Pay attention!

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	The car is parked in the City.  PAULIE comes down from an
	available apartment and gets back into the car.

				PAULIE
		Good for ten men...

				CLEMENZA
		OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm
		suppose to call when I found
		somethin'.

	The car pulls off.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
	CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		You wait; I'll call.

	He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
	corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

	INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
	The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
	bread--and then a plate of veal on his table.  He eats.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
	he is well fed.

	We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
	expect has happened to Paulie.

	There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
	LAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.

				CLEMENZA
		He talked my ear off.  Want us to
		go back to Long Beach; have another
		job for us.  Rocco, you live in the
		City, can we drop you off?

				LAMPONE (O.S.)
		Ah, I left my car at your place.

				CLEMENZA
		OK, then you gotta come back.

	The car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
	secure.

				PAULIE
		You think we'll go for that last
		place?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe, or you gotta know now.

				PAULIE
		Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

	The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
	Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a
		leak.

	The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA
	steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

	He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
	see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
	the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there
	are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
	turns, moving back to the car.

	PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
	him are shattered.

				CLEMENZA
		Leave the gun.

	LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
	feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange
	cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group
	of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
	with concealed weapons.

	MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

	He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the
	strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They
	look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
	respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He
	wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

	A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
	equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This
	is where he was a child.  Then a shout.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone.

	CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL
	hurries into the house.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
	He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the
	hook.

				CLEMENZA
		Some dame.

	MICHAEL picks it up.

				MICHAEL
		Hello.  Kay?

				KAY (O.S.)
		How is your father?

				MICHAEL
		He'll be OK.

				KAY (O.S.)
			  (pause)
		I love you.

	He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the
	phone.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I LOVE YOU.

				MICHAEL
		Yeah Kay, I'm here.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Can you say it?

				MICHAEL
		Huh?

				KAY (O.S.)
		Tell me you love me.

	MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls
	up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

				MICHAEL
		I can't...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Please say it.

				MICHAEL
		Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

				KAY (O.S.)
		OK.
			  (click)


	CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all
	the button men stationed around the house.

				CLEMENZA
		How come you don't tell that nice
		girl you love her...here, learn
		something... you may have to feed
		fifty guys some day.  You start
		with olive oil...fry some garlic,
		see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat
		balls if you like...then you throw
		in the tomatoes, the tomato
		paste...some basil; and a little
		red wine...that's my trick.

	SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

				SONNY
		You take care of Paulie?

				CLEMENZA
		You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's
		sick for good this winter.

	MICHAEL starts to leave.

				SONNY
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		To the city.

				SONNY
			  (to Clemenza; dipping
			  bread into the sauce)
		Send some bodyguards.

				MICHAEL
		I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just
		going to see Pop in the hospital.
		Also, I got other things.

				CLEMENZA
		Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

				SONNY
		OK, but be careful.

	EXT NITE: CAR

	MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven
	into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front
	seat.

	INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

	MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying
	to book rooms.

	INT NITE: HOTEL

	MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel.  He is
	preoccupied, she's concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
		I'll just sit with him; I want to
		show respect.

				KAY
		Can I go to the hospital with you?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  You don't want
		to end up on page 3 of the Daily
		News.

				KAY
		My parents don't read the Daily
		News.  All right, if you think I
		shouldn't.  I can't believe the
		things the papers are printing.
		I'm sure most of it's not true.

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so either.
			  (silence)
		I better go.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to go back to New
		Hampshire...think things over.

	He leans over her; kisses her.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		Goodbye.

	Quietly, he moves out the door.

	KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

				KAY
		Goodbye.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
	a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays
	the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

	MICHAEL looks.

	He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He
	is the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling
	Christmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,
	slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He
	hesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the
	address on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the
	door, it is empty.

	He walks in.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
	lobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
	corridor.  To the left: the same.

	HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
	building lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are
	his sole footsteps.

	He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there.
	He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it;
	no one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a
	sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

				MICHAEL
		Hello?  Hello?

	Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
	alertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
	alone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

	Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
	flights.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

	He steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are
	merely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;
	checks it.  "Room 4A."  Now he hurries, trying to follow the
	code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
	and quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A--
	Corleone".

	There is a special card table set up there with some
	magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
	ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

	INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

	Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
	will find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the
	window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
	room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be
	heard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly
	MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
	securely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
	bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a
	NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

				NURSE
		You're not supposed to be here now.

	MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

				MICHAEL
		I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
		father.  What happened to the
		detectives who were guarding him?

				NURSE
		Oh your father just had too many
		visitors.  It interfered with the
		hospital service.  The police came
		and made them all leave just ten
		minutes ago.
			  (comfortingly)
		But don't worry.  I look in on him.

				MICHAEL
		You just stand here one minute...

	Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

				MICHAEL
		Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
		down at the hospital.  I came down
		late.  There's no one here.  None
		of Tessio's people--no detectives,
		no one.  The old man is completely
		unprotected.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		All right, get him in a different
		room; lock the door from the inside.
		I'll have some men there inside of
		fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and
		don't panic.

				MICHAEL
			  (furiously, but kept inside)
		I won't panic.

	He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

				NURSE
		You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You and I are going to move my
		father right now...to another room
		on another floor...Can you
		disconnect those tubes so we can
		wheel the bed out?

				NURSE
		Absolutely not!  We have to get
		permission from the Doctor.

				MICHAEL
		You've read about my father in the
		papers.  You've seen that no one's
		here to guard him.  Now I've just
		gotten word that men are coming to
		this hospital to kill him.  Believe
		me and help me.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		We don't have to disconnect them,
		we can wheel the stand with the bed.

	She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
	moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
	down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
	MICHAEL hears them, stops.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry, into there.

	They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks
	out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they
	emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
	of flowers.

				MICHAEL
			  (stepping out)
		Who is it?

				ENZO
		Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,
		the baker's helper to Nazorine, now
		his son-in-law.

				MICHAEL
		Enzo, get out of here.  There's
		going to be trouble.

	A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

				ENZO
		If there...will be trouble...I stay
		with you, to help.  I owe it to the
		Godfather.

	MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

				MICHAEL
		Go outside; stand in front...I'll
		be out in a minute.

	INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	They part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they
	put his FATHER.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		He's awake.

	MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
	cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

				MICHAEL
		Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,
		don't try to speak.  There are men
		who are coming to try to kill you.
		But I'm with you...I'm with you
		now...

	The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly
	puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

	Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
	pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
	weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They
	both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
	They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
	lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of those and look like
		you've got a gun in your pocket.

	The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
	decorations.

				MICHAEL
		Listen...

	We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL
	and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes
	the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
	They stand, hands in their pockets.

	A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
	MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car
	seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
	MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the
	BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they
	are not.

	Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
	police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
	getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

	In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
	the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
	POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts
	toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
	arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
	spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
	with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is
	McCLUSKEY.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I thought I got all you guinea
		hoods locked up.  Who the hell are
		you and what are you doing here?

	ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

				COP
		He's clean, Captain.

	MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		What happened to the detectives who
		were supposed to be guarding my
		father?

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		You punk-hood.  Who the hell are
		you to tell me my business.  I
		pulled them off.  I don't care how
		many Dago gangsters kill each other.
		I wouldn't lift a finger to keep
		your old man from getting knocked
		off.  Now get the hell out of here;
		get off this street you punk, and
		stay away from this hospital.

	MICHAEL stands quiet.

				MICHAEL
		I'll stay until you put guards
		around my father's room.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Phil, lock this punk up.

				A DETECTIVE
		The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a
		war hero, and he's never been mixed
		up in the rackets...

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put
		the cuffs on him.

				MICHAEL
			  (deliberately, right
			  to McCLUSKEY's face,
			  as he's being handcuffed)
		How much is the Turk paying you to
		set my father up, Captain?

	Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
	squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
	MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at
	McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
	he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
	MEN arrive.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a
	long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN
	stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
	rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
	standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is
	escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
	MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He
	stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN
	holding rifles.

				MICHAEL
		Christ, Sonny really means business.

	They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various
	BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

				CLEMENZA
		How come all the new men?

				TESSIO
		We'll need them now.  After the
		hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
		We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
		this morning.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

	They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

				SONNY
		I've got a hundred button men on
		the streets twenty-four hours a day.
		If Sollozzo shows one hair on his
		ass he's dead.

	He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
	kiddingly.

				SONNY
		Mikey, you look beautiful!

				MICHAEL
		Cut it out.

				SONNY
		The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve
		of that son of a bitch!  After he
		craps out last night he wants a meet.

				HAGEN
		Was there a definite proposal?

				SONNY
		Sure, he wants us to send Mike to
		meet him to hear his proposition.
		The promise is the deal will be so
		good we can't refuse.

				HAGEN
		What about that Tattaglias?  What
		will they do about Bruno?

				SONNY
		Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out
		what they did to my father.

				HAGEN
		We should hear what they have to say.

				SONNY
		No, no Consiglere.  Not this time.
		No more meetings, no more
		discussions, no more Sollozzo
		tricks.  Give them one message: I
		WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all
		out war.  We go to the mattresses
		and we put all the button men out
		on the street.

				HAGEN
		The other families won't sit still
		for all out war.

				SONNY
		Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

				HAGEN
		Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
		want to hear this.  This is not a
		personal thing, this is Business.

				SONNY
		And when they shot me father...

				HAGEN
		Yes, even the shooting of your
		father was business, not personal...

				SONNY
		No no, no more advice on how to
		patch it up Tom.  You just help me
		win.  Understood?

	HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

				HAGEN
		I found out about this Captain
		McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
		He's definitely on Sollozzo's
		payroll, and for big money.
		McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
		bodyguard.  What you have to
		understand is that while Sollozzo
		is guarded like this, he's
		invulnerable.  Nobody has ever
		gunned down a New York Police
		Captain.  Never.  It would be
		disastrous.  All the five families
		would come after you Sonny; the
		Corleone family would be outcasts;
		even the old man's political
		protection would run for cover.  So
		just...take that into consideration.

				SONNY
			  (still fuming)
		McCluskey can't stay with the Turk
		forever.  We'll wait.

				MICHAEL
		We can't wait.  No matter what
		Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
		figuring out how to kill Pop.  You
		have to get Sollozzo now.

				SONNY
		The kid's right.

				HAGEN
		What about McCluskey?

				MICHAEL
		Let's say now that we have to kill
		McCluskey.  We'll clear that up
		through our Newspaper contacts later.

				SONNY
		Go on Mike.

				MICHAEL
		They want me to go to the conference
		with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting
		for two days from now.  Sonny, get
		our informers to find out where the
		meeting will be held.
		Insist it has to be a public place:
		a bar or restaurant at the height
		of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel
		safe.  They'll check me when I meet
		them so I won't be able to carry a
		weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
		way to have one planted there for
		me.
			  (pause)
		Then I'll kill them both.

	Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
	Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points
	a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

				SONNY
		You?  You, the high-class college
		kid.  You never wanted to get mixed
		up in the family business.  Now you
		wanta gun down a police Captain and
		the Turk just because you got
		slapped in the face.  You're taking
		it personal, it's just business and
		he's taking it personal.

	Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
	his face serious.

				MICHAEL
			  (angrily, but cold)
		Sonny, it's all personal, and I
		learned it from him, the old man,
		the Godfather.  He took my joining
		the Marines personal.  I take
		Sollozzo trying to kill my father
		personal, and you know I'll kill
		them Sonny.

	MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

	INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE on a revolver.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		It's as cold as they come,
		impossible to trace.
			  (he turns it upside down)
		Don't worry about prints Mike, I
		put a special tape on the trigger
		and butt.  Here.
			  (he hands the gun to
			  another pair of hands)
		Whatsamatter?  Trigger too tight.
			  (it fires: very LOUD)
		I left it noisy, so it'll scare any
		pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander
		away.

	MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

				CLEMENZA
		Just let your hand drop to your
		side, and let the gun slip out.
		Everybody will still think you got
		it.  They'll be starin' at your
		face, see?  Then walk out of the
		place real fast, but don't run.
		Don't look anybody directly in the
		eye, but don't look away from them
		neither.  Hey, they'll be scared
		stiff o you, believe me.  Nobody's
		gonna bother with you.  Don't worry
		about nothing; you'd be surprised
		how good these things go.  O.K.,
		put your hat on, let's see how you
		look.  Helps with identification.

	They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

				CLEMENZA
		Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse
		to change their identification when
		we make them see the light.  Then
		you take a long vacation and we
		catch the hell.

				MICHAEL
		How bad will it be?

				CLEMENZA
		Probably all the other families
		will line up against us.  But, it's
		alright.  These things have to
		happen once every ten years or
		so...gets rid of the bad blood.
		You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
		Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at
		Munich, they shoulda never let him
		get away with that, they were just
		asking for big trouble...

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card
	table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
	Corleone buttonmen.

	He continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY
	asleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of
	a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
	whisky.  The radio is playing.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you stop living like a
		bum and get this place cleaned up.

				SONNY
		What are you, inspecting the
		barracks?
			  (SONNY sits up with
			  his head in his hands)
		You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you
		be sure to drop the gun right away?

				MICHAEL
		A million times.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to
		pick you up in an hour and a half
		on Times Square, under the big
		Camels sign.

				HAGEN
		We don't let Mike go until we have
		the hostage, Sonny.

				CLEMENZA
		It's okay...the hostage is outside
		playing pinochle with three of my
		men.

	The phone rings in the DON's office.

				SONNY
		That could be a Tattaglia informer
		with the meeting place.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
	move in.

	HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

				SONNY
		One of Tattaglia's people?

				HAGEN
		No.  Our informer in McCluskey's
		precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he
		signed out for Louis' Restaurant in
		the Bronx.  Anyone know it.

				TESSIO
		Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us.
		A small family place with big
		booths where people can talk in
		private.  Good food.  Everybody
		minds their business.  Perfect.
			  (he moves to the desk
			  and makes a crude drawing)
		This is the entrance, Mike.  When
		you finish just walk out and turn
		left, then turn the corner.
		Clemenza, you gotta work fast to
		plant the gun.  They got an old-
		fashioned toilet with a space
		between the water container and the
		wall.  We can tape the gun behind
		there.

				CLEMENZA
		Mike, they're gonna frisk you in
		the car.  You'll be clean so they
		won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the
		restaurant, wait and talk a while,
		and then ask permission to go.  See?
		Then when you come out, don't waste
		time; don't sit down...you come out
		blasting.  And don't take chances.
		In the head, two shots apiece.  And
		out as fast as your legs can move.

				SONNY
		I want somebody very good, very
		safe to plant that gun.  I don't
		want my brother coming out of that
		toilet with just his dick in his
		hand.

				CLEMENZA
		The gun will be there.

				SONNY
			  (to MICHAEL, warmly)
		You're on, kid...I'll square it
		with Mom your not seeing her before
		you left.  And I'll get a message
		to your girl friend when I think
		the time is right.

				CLEMENZA
		We gotta move...

				MICHAEL
		O.K.  How long do you think before
		I can come back?

				SONNY
		Probably a year...

				HAGEN
			  (starting to crack)
		Jesus, I don't know...

				SONNY
		Can you do it Mike?

	MICHAEL moves out.

	EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

	The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
	MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
	CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the
	corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open
	the front door.

				DRIVER
		Get in, Mike.

	He does, the car drives off.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
	and shakes MIKE's hand.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we
		can straighten everything out.  All
		this is terrible, it's not the way
		I wanted things to happen at all.
		It should never have happened.

				MICHAEL
		I want to settle things tonight.  I
		want my father left alone.

				SOLLOZZO
		He won't be; I swear to you be my
		children he won't be.  Just keep an
		open mind when we talk.  I hope
		you're not a hothead like your
		brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to
		talk business with him.

	McCLUSKEY grunts.

				MCCLUSKEY
		He's a good kid.  He's all right.
		Turn around, up on your knees,
		facing me.

	He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I'm sorry about the other night
		Mike.  I'm getting too old for my
		job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the
		aggravation.  You know how it is.
		He's clean.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
	they're heading.

	The car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		We're going to New Jersey?

				SOLLOZZO
			  (sly)
		Maybe.

	MICHAEL closes his eyes.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

	The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
	to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider,
	temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
	lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on
	the way back to the city.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
	then leans to the DRIVER.

				SOLLOZZO
		Nice work; I'll remember it.

	MICHAEL is relieved.

	EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
	the Bronx:  The "LUNA AZURA".  There is no one on the street.
	MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
	them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
	and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
	car.  They enter the restaurant.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
	SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
	round table near the center of the room.  There are empty
	booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
	and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Is the Italian food good here?

				SOLLOZZO
		Try the veal; it's the finest in
		New York.

	The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
	They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
	glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

				SOLLOZZO
		I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll
		concentrate on my veal and my
		spaghetti.

	SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening
	carefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers
	in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally
	brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
	Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
	Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

				MICHAEL
			  (using English for emphasis)
		Most important...I want a sure
		guarantee that no more attempts
		will be made on my father's life.

				SOLLOZZO
		What guarantees can I give you?  I
		am the hunted one.  I've missed my
		chance.  You think too highly of
		me, my friend...I am not so
		clever...all I want if a truce...

	MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
	holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up
	my sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
	on his face.

				SOLLOZZO
		What is it?

				MICHAEL
		Is it all right if I go to the
		bathroom?

	SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with
	his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
	thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I frisked him; I've frisked
		thousands of young punks; he's clean.

	He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
	indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,
	indicating no one is there.

				SOLLOZZO
		Don't take too long.

	MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
	disappears inside.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
	hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his
	hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
	Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
	Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
	cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is
	just a few inches from the gun...he gropes
	searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

	CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he
	breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
	breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some
	unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
	washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
	McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO
	turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
	MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues
	back to the table.  He sits down.

				MICHAEL
		Now I can talk.  I feel much better.

	The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
	he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
	comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
	his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
	but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
	him.

	The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
	speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
	from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
	the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
	temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
	head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
	entire area.

	The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
	sprayed and stained with blood.

	SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
	seems to hang in space suspended.

	MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

	There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
	suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

	MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
	throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then
	coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
	through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

	The air is filled with pink mist.
	MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
	He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
	Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
	The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
	expression of horror on his face.
	MICHAEL looks at his two victims:
	SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
	the table.
	McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
	MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His
	hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
	He moves, not letting the gun go.

	MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

	His hand: still holding the gun.

	His face: finally he closes his eyes.

	His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

	He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

	He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
	been recreated in wax.

	Then he leaves.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old
	upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
	ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

	A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,
	quietly eating.  They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there
	is an occasional laugh.

	ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered
	with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

	A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

	The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

	INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie
	still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

	INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS

	Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty
	living room of an apartment.  THREE or FOUR MEN including
	CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

	An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

	The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and
	pouring the wine.

	Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

	INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an
	office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
	Truman.

	EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

	ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning
	three steps of a front stoop.

	INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a
	crossword puzzle.

	A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

	Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
	Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

	A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of
	Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

	EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

	A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet
	alley.

	INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in
	a pool of blood on the tablecloth.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an
	apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family
	War..."

	The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE
	has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

	SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

	The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up
	and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods
	appreciatively.

				MAN
		Nice Augie...nice.

	EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

	Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
	apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's
	bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
	against the curb.

	Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
	brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

	Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,
	smoking a cigarette.

	One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,
	which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a
	door opening; they look up.

	The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

	SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
	wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she
	draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
	comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

	He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
	on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The
	men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:

				DRIVER
		Pick up your sister?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

	The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
	bodyguards in their cars.

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

	He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again.

				CONNIE'S VOICE
		Who is it?

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY
	enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
	back to him.

				SONNY
			  (tenderly)
		Connie, what is it?

	He turns her around in his arms.

	Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
	rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
	As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
	with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
	him from running out of the apartment.

				CONNIE
			  (desperately)
		It was my fault!  I started a fight
		with him and I tried to hit him so
		he hit me.  He didn't even try to
		hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

	Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder,
	the thin silk robe.

				SONNY
		I'm goin' to have the doctor come
		over and take a look at you.

	He starts to leave.

				CONNIE
		Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
		Please don't.

	He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

				SONNY
		Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do?
		Make your kid a orphan before he's
		born.

	She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

	EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

	CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
	"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
	beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
	corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
	kids on the street are still playing stickball.

	CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
	suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
	and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires
	scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
	MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
	the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we
	recognize that it is SONNY.

	His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
	the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

	He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
	into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
	and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
	hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
	His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

	SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

	SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
	in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His
	blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

	The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
	in fascination.

	CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

	SONNY beats him mercilessly.

	Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
	spectators.

	SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
	CARLO's face and body.

	CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
	nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

	SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
	him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
	the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
	even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.

	It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
	not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
	more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he
	stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

				SONNY
		You...bastard...You...hurt my
		sister... again...and I'll
		kill...you.

	He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
	and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
	leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN
	with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
	interested.

	CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps
	onto the stoop.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day.
	Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
	various points around the main house and compound.  Things
	have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
	and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures
	that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
	a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
	Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
	result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the
	crater is damaged by fire.

	A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
	yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
	shelter of the gate house.

	They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
	call the main house.

	KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
	runs down onto her face.

	She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
	sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

	TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

				HAGEN
		Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You
		should call...

				KAY
		I've tried calling and writing.  I
		want to reach Michael.

				HAGEN
		Nobody knows where he is.  We know
		he's all right, but that's all.

	KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
	rainwater.

				KAY
		What was that?

				HAGEN
		An accident.  No one was hurt.

				KAY
		Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
		come in to call another one?

	TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
	to.

				HAGEN
		Sure...I'm sorry.

	They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
	takes her rainhat off.

				KAY
		Will you give this to him.

				HAGEN
		If I accept that letter and you
		told a Court of Law I accepted it,
		they would interpret it as my
		having knowledge of his whereabouts.
		Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

	We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
	enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

				MAMA
		You're Mikey's little girl.

	KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

				MAMA
		You eat anything?

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
			  (to HAGEN)
		Disgrazia, you don't even give the
		poor girl a cup of coffee?

	HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
	toward MAMA, the letter extended.

				KAY
		Will you give this letter to Michael.

				HAGEN
		Mama, no.

				MAMA
		You tell me what to do?  Even he
		don't tell me what to do.

	She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

				KAY
		Why did they blame Michael?

				MAMA
		You listen to me, you go home to
		your family, and you find a good
		young man and get married.  Forget
		about Mikey; he's no good for you,
		anymore.

	She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
	that means.

	EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

	A hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance
	with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
	hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
	ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
	the DON.

	TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
	up the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
	moment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly,
	siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
	cars.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	The Corleone Mall.

	Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
	Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES.

	It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
	All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday
	clothes, wait.

	EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

	One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,
	preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a
	team of BUTTON MEN.

	Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with
	a rifle on his lap.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

	Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

	Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully
	under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and
	various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

	All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,
	THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
	been converted into a hospital room, with complete and
	extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to
	kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
	SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
	should leave.

	They do, the door is closed.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the
	Sunday dinner, and set the table.

	CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

				CONNIE
		What's the matter, Carlo?

				CARLO
		Shut up.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
	grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON
	does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
	glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is
	the spokesman for the family.

				HAGEN
		...since McCluskey's killing, the
		police have cracked down on most of
		our operations...on the other
		families too.  There's been a lot
		of bad blood.

	The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

				SONNY
		Pop, they hit us and we hit them
		back.

				HAGEN
		We put out a lot of material
		through our contacts in the
		Newspapers...about McCluskey's
		being tied up with Sollozzo in the
		Drug Rackets...things are starting
		to loosen up.

	The OLD MAN nods.

				SONNY
		Freddie's gonna go to Las
		Vegas...under the protection of Don
		Francesco of L.A.  I want him to
		rest...

				FREDO
		I'm goin' to learn the casino
		business.

	The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room
	for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

				HAGEN
		Michael...
			  (he takes a breath)
		It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

	The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
	rage.

				HAGEN
		He's safe now...we're already
		working on ways to bring him back.

	The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
	leave him alone.

	INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
	expansive and optimistic.

				SONNY
		We'll let the old man take it easy
		for a couple of weeks.  I want to
		get things going good before he
		gets better.  What's the matter
		with you?

				HAGEN
		You start operating, the five
		families will start their raids
		again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny,
		your war is costing us a lot of
		money.

				SONNY
		No more stalemate Tom, we got the
		soldiers, we'll match them gun for
		gun if that's how they want it.
		They know me for what I am, Tom--
		and they're scared of me.

				HAGEN
		Yes.  That's true, you're getting a
		hell of a reputation.

				SONNY
		Well it's war!  We might not be in
		this shape if we had a real war-
		time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop
		had Genco, who do I have?
			  (TOM starts to leave)
		Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday,
		we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be
		sore.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table
	over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed
	Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally
	by the gate.

	ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A
	young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

	-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

	CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone.
	We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

				CONNIE
		Who is this?

				GIRL (O.S.)
			  (giggle)
		I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just
		wanted to tell him I can't see him
		tonight; I have to go out of town.

	CONNIE's face turns red.

				CONNIE
		You lousy tramp bitch.
			  (click)


	She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
	bathroom drying his golden body.

				CARLO
		What was that?

				CONNIE
		Your girl friend.  She says she
		can't make it tonight.  You lousy
		bastard you have the nerve to give
		your whores my telephone number.
		I'll kill you, you bastard!

	She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
	she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
	belly heaving under the thin slip.

				CARLO
			  (defending himself)
		You're crazy.  She was kidding
		around; I don't know, some nut.

	He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue
	dressing.

				CONNIE
		You're staying home.  You're not
		going out.

				CARLO
		OK, OK.  You gonna make me something
		to eat at least?

	That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
	heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
	starts her wifely duties.

	CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
	the doorway.

				CONNIE
		The food is on the table.

				CARLO
		I'm not hungry yet.

				CONNIE
		Eat it, it's on the table.

				CARLO
		Ba Fa Goulle.

				CONNIE
		BA FA GOULE YOU!

	She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment
	later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO
	slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
	smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
	veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

				CARLO
		You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
		Clean it up or I'll kick your head
		in.

				CONNIE
		Like hell I will.

	She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.  Slowly,
	he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
	his hand.

				CARLO
		Clean it up!

	He swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back
	into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
	ready.

				CARLO
		Even the female Corleones are
		murderers.

	He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She
	makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He
	pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She
	gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
	gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

	She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

				CONNIE
		The baby!  The baby!

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM  (SPRING 1946)

	She runs into the bedroom; he follows.  She moves into a
	corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide
	under the bed.

	He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

	He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
	throws her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her
	thigh, pinching it very hard.

				CARLO
		You're fat as a pig.

	Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving
	her in tears.  She is crying; she pulls herself to the
	bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

				CONNIE
		Mama...mama, it's Connie.  Mama, I
		can't talk any louder.  No, I don't
		want to talk to Sonny.

	We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

	In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the
	whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

				SONNY
		Yeah Connie.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Sonny, just send a car to bring me
		home.  I'll tell you then, it's
		nothing Sonny, don't you come.
		Send TOM, please Sonny, it's
		nothing; I just want to come home.

	SONNY's face is turning red.

				SONNY
			  (in a controlled voice)
		You wait there.  You just wait there.

	He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

	HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he
	cannot interfere.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	SONNY leaves the house.  HAGEN moves to the outside mall
	just as SONNY's car is driving off.  He moves to a group of
	BUTTON MEN.

				HAGEN
		Go after him.

	EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
	After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is
	trailing.

	SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY in his car; driving back.  Still breathing hard and
	still furious.  Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
	He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a
	toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
	COLLECTOR.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

	The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

	BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
	BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

				BONASERA
		Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		You owe the Don a service.  In one
		hour, not before, perhaps later, he
		will be at your funeral parlor to
		ask for your help.  Be there to
		greet him.  If you have any
		objections speak now, and I'll
		inform him.

	Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

				BONASERA
		Anything...Anything the Godfather
		wishes.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Good.  He never doubted you.

				BONASERA
		The Don himself is coming to me
		tonight?

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Yes.
			  (click)


	BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
	sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

	Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows
	something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
	from him.  He lights a cigarette.

				BONASERA
		For the last year, they have been
		killing one another.  So now, what?
		Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
			  (whispering, slyly)
		They've killed someone so important
		that they wish to make his body
		disappear.

				MRS. BONASERA
			  (frightened)
		Amerigo!

				BONASERA
		They could make me an accomplice to
		their murder.  They could send me
		to jail!

	He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to
	tie his tie, as she has done for years.

				BONASERA
		And if the other families find
		out...they will make me their enemy.
		They could come here to our house.
		I curse the day I ever went to the
		Godfather.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
	turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
	past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that
	lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into
	the alley.

	He sits on a bench, and waits.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

	The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;
	we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
	parlor.

	CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
	BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO
	OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
	CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
	protruding.

	BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
	the MEN should carry their sinister burden.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming
	room.

	Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
	darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE.

	He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His
	cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
	Then, after a long gaze:

				DON CORLEONE
		Well my friend, are you ready to do
		me this service?

	BONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
	table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

				BONASERA
		What do you wish me to do?

				DON CORLEONE
			  (staring at the table)
		I want you to use all your powers,
		all your skill, as you love me.  I
		do not want his mother to see him
		as he is.

	He draws down the gray blanket.

	BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

	The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

	A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the
	booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets
	him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
	booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
	car blocking him.

	The windows of his car are shot out.

	Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

	His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

	His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it
	continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that
	he will survive it.

	Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and
	actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER
	fire.

	His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

	A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and
	make off in the distance.

	SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they
	are too late.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.  He is silent
	a moment, and then:

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		OK.  Go to Clemenza's house and
		tell him to come here right away.
		He'll tell you what to do.

	The MEN leave him alone.  He is quiet, standing in the
	middle of the living room a moment.  He looks in the
	direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
	moving around.

	INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

	TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
	DON's room.  He opens the DON's door.  Looks in.

	INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON in his hospital bed.  Asleep under sedation.  HAGEN
	hesitates.  He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.  He
	closes the door.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at
	the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he
	hears footsteps.

	The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
	slowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed
	armchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into
	HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Give me a drop of anisette.

	HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

				DON CORLEONE
		My wife was weeping before she fell
		asleep, outside my window I saw my
		caporegimes to the house, and it is
		midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine,
		I think you should tell your Don
		what everyone knows.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was
		about to come up and wake you and
		tell you.  Just now.

				DON CORLEONE
		But you needed a drink first.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now you've had your drink.

	Pause.

				HAGEN
		They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
			  (pause)
		He's dead.

	DON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he
	loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
	him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		I want no inquiries made.  No acts
		of vengeance.
			  (pause)
		Consigliere, arrange a meeting with
		the heads of the five
		families...this war stops now.

	He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

				DON CORLEONE
		Call Bonasera...he will do me a
		service.

	And leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

				HAGEN
		This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

				BONASERA (O.S.)
		Yes, I understand I'm listening.

				HAGEN
		You owe the Don a service.  He has
		no doubt that you will repay it.

	EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

	Day in Manhattan.  An impressive Bank Building in the
	financial center of New York.  Many limousines are parked,
	uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

	INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

	CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
	sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
	MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
	settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
	as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

				DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
		I want to thank you all for coming.
		I consider it a service done to me
		personally and I am in the debt of
		each and every one of you.
		Especially those of you who have
		traveled from such distances as
		California, St. Louis, Kansas City;
		and New Orleans...

	The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
	younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
	short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
	table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
	JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
	older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
	CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
	DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
	and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
	early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
	CONNIE's Wedding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Ah well, let's get down to business.
		We are all honorable men here, we
		don't have to give assurances as if
		we were lawyers.
			  (he sits, gazes out
			  at them, and sighs)
		How did things ever go so far?
		Well, no matter.  A lot of
		foolishness has come to pass.  It
		was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

	The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A
	large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
	and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
	the day's trading, and projected above.

	DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia has lost a son; I have
		lost a son.  We are quits.  Let
		there be a peace...
			  (he gestures
			  expressively,
			  submissively, with
			  his hands)
		That is all I want...

				BARZINI
		Don Corleone is too modest.  He had
		the judges and politicians in his
		pocket and he refused to share them.
		His refusal is not the act of a
		friend.  He takes the bread out of
		the mouths of our families.  Times
		have changed, it's not like the old
		days where everyone can go his own
		way.  If Don Corleone had all the
		judges and politicians in New York,
		then he must share them or let
		others use them.  Certainly he can
		present a bill for such services,
		we're not Communists, after all.
		But he has to let us draw water
		from the well.  It's that simple.

				DON CORLEONE
		My friends, I didn't refuse out of
		malice.  You all know me.  When
		have I ever refused an accommodation?
		But why, this time?  Because I
		think this drug business will
		destroy us in the years to come.
		It's not like whiskey or gambling
		or even women which most people
		want and is forbidden them by the
		pezzonovante of the Church and the
		Government.  But drugs?  No.  Even
		policemen, who help us in gambling
		and other things would refuse to
		help us in drugs.  But...I am
		willing to do whatever all of you
		think is necessary.

				DON ZALUCHI
		I don't believe in drugs.  For
		years I paid my people extra so
		they wouldn't do that kind of
		business...$200 a week.  But it
		didn't matter.  Somebody comes to
		them and says, "I have powders, if
		you put up three, four thousand
		dollar investment, we can make
		fifty thousand distributing."  Who
		can resist such a profit?
		There's no way to control it, as a
		business...to keep it respectable.
			  (rapping the table)
		I don't want it near schools!  I
		don't want it sold to children.
		That is an infamita.
			  (thinking)
		In my city I would try to keep the
		traffic in the dark people, the
		colored.  They are the best
		customers, the least troublesome,
		and they are animals anyway.  They
		have no respect for their wives or
		their families or themselves.  Let
		them lose their souls with drugs.
		But something has to be done, we
		can't have everybody running around
		doing just what they please, like a
		bunch of anarchists.

				BARZINI
		Then, are we agreed; the traffic in
		drugs will be permitted, but
		controlled; and Don Corleone agrees
		to give it protection in the East.

	DON CORLEONE nods.

				BARZINI
		That's the whole matter then, we
		have the peace, and let me pay my
		respects to Don Corleone, whom we
		have all known over the years as a
		man of his word.
			  (noticing TATTAGLIA
			  is uneasy)
		Don Philip?

				TATTAGLIA
		I agree to everything here, I'm
		willing to forget my own misfortune.
		But I must hear strict assurance
		from Corleone.  When time goes by
		and his position becomes stronger,
		will he attempt any individual
		vengeance?

	They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
	DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
	else in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.

				DON CORLEONE
		I forego my vengeance for my dead
		son, for the common good.  But I
		have selfish reasons.  My youngest
		son had to flee, accused of
		Sollozzo's murder, and I must now
		make arrangements so that he can
		come home with safety, cleared of
		all those false charges.  That is
		my affair, and I will make those
		arrangements.
			  (with strength)
		But I am a superstitious man...and
		so if some unlucky accident should
		befall my youngest son, if some
		police officer should accidentally
		shoot him, or if he should hang
		himself in his cell, or if my son
		is struck by a bolt of lightning,
		then I will blame some of the
		people here.  That, I could never
		forgive, but...aside from that, let
		me swear by the souls of my
		Grandchildren that I will never be
		the one to break the peace we have
		made.

	EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

	The DON's black limousine.  He sits quietly in the padded
	rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

	It is night.  Lights flash by them every so often.

				HAGEN
		When I meet with Tattaglia's
		people; should I insist that all
		his drug middle-men be clean?

				DON CORLEONE
		Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini
		is a man who will know that without
		being told.

				HAGEN
		You mean Tattaglia.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (shaking his head)
		Barzini.

				HAGEN
			  (a revelation)
		He was the one behind Sollozzo?

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could
		never have outfought Santino.  But
		I wasn't sure until this day.  No,
		it was Barzini all along.

	The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

	------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

	A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
	downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left
	grotesque and misshapen.

	GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
	jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

	THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
	either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
	shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
	honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
	and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry
	knapsacks.

	The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
	overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

	EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

	The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
	their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn
	sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
	An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The
	car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods
	respectfully.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Michael, why must you do this.  We
		have been lucky so far, all these
		months you've been here we've kept
		your name a secret.  It is from
		love for your father that I've
		asked you never to more than an
		hour from the Villa.

				MICHAEL
		Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
		nothing will happen.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		You must understand that your
		Father's enemies have friends in
		Palermo.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		Corleone.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		There is nothing there.  Not anymore.

				MICHAEL
		I was told that my Grandfather was
		murdered on its main street; and
		his murderers came to kill my
		father there when he was twelve
		years old.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Long ago.  Now there is nothing:
		the men killed each other in family
		vendettas...the others escaped to
		America.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino...I should see this
		place.

	DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		That is your birthright...but
		Michael, use this car.

				MICHAEL
		No...I would like to walk to
		Corleone.

	The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Be careful Michael, don't let them
		know your name.

	The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
	on his journey.

	EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

	The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
	trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

	EXT DAY: VILLAGE

	They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
	post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
	empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
	gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there
	are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

	The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
	road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

	EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

	They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
	a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

	EXT DAY: FIELD

	Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
	of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
	marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
	carrying billowing red banners.

	EXT DAY: GROVE

	They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
	is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

	The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
	loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

	MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

				FABRIZZIO
		You tell us about America.

				MICHAEL
		How do you know I come from America?

				FABRIZZIO
		We hear.  We were told you were a
		Pezzonovanta...big shot.

				MICHAEL
		Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

				FABRIZZIO
		Hey America!  Is she as rich as
		they say?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				FABRIZZIO
		Take me to America!  You need a
		good lupara in America?
			  (pats his shotgun)
		You take me, I'll be the best man
		you got.  "Oh say, can you
		seeee...By da star early light..."

	MICHAEL laughs.

	EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

	The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
	convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
	the U.S. drivers, as they move by.

				FABRIZZIO
		America.
		Hey America!
		Take me with you!
		Hey, take me to America G.I.!

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

	They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
	they hesitate, and look down.

				CALO
		Corleone.

	They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

	MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
	the village.  They walk behind him, and spread to either
	side about fifteen feet away from him.

	They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
	MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
	They go on.

	They move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the
	doorways that they pass.

	MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

	CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

				CALO
		The names of the dead.

	MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.

	The street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman
	will pass.

	MICHAEL turns his head.

	The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

	A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
	street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

	A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead
	is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
	discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of
	young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
	dressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,
	purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
	blossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

	MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
	Fantasy-like scene.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (calling out to them)
		Hey, beautiful girls!

				MICHAEL
			  (sternly)
		Shhhhh.

	He settles down to watch.

	The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
	cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but
	developed and womanly.

	They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
	aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
	Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
	playfully, in the direction of the grove.

	The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
	left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
	them back at her pursuers laughing.

	They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she
	poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
	view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about
	to run.

	MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.

	Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
	and a rich mouth.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (murmuring)
		Jesus Christ, take my soul.  I'm
		dying.

	Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

	MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold
	on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
	laughing.  Then he turns to them.

				FABRIZZIO
		You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

	CALO pats him on the shoulder.

				CALO
		Easy man.

				MICHAEL
		What are you talking about?

				FABRIZZIO
		You can't hide it when you're hit
		by the thunderbolt.

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

	The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
	is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

	MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
	square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

	The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
	he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
	their table.

				FABRIZZIO
		You know all the girls in this
		town, eh?  We saw some beauties
		coming down the road.  One in
		particular got our friend hit with
		the Thunderbolt...
			  (he indicates MICHAEL)

	VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
	new interest.

				VITELLI
		You had better bring a few bottles
		home with you, my friend; you'll
		need help sleeping tonight.
			  (he laughs)

				FABRIZZIO
		This one could seduce the devil.  A
		body! and eyes as big and black as
		olives.

				VITELLI
			  (laughing with
			  them...pouring more wine)
		I know about what you mean!

				FABRIZZIO
		This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?

				VITELLI
			  (laughing)
		Beautiful all over, eh?

				FABRIZZIO
		And hair.  Black and curly, like a
		doll.  And such a mouth.

	VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

				VITELLI
		Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
		but virtuous.

	VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

				MICHAEL
		She wore a red dress, and a red
		ribbon in her hair.  She looks more
		Greek than Italian.  Do you know a
		beauty like that?

	As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
	until he wears a scowl.

				VITELLI
		No.

	Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

				FABRIZZIO
		God in Heaven, I think I
		understand...

	He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he
	returns.

				FABRIZZIO
		Let's get out of here; he's boiling
		up his blood to do us mischief.
		It's his daughter.

	They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

				CALO
		Come quickly.

				MICHAEL
		Innkeeper.  More wine!

				FABRIZZIO
			  (whispered)
		The old bastard mentioned two sons
		he only has to whistle up.

	MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

				MICHAEL
		Tell him to come to me.

	The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
	a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
	between them.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		I understand I've offended you by
		talking about your daughter.  I
		offer you my apologies, I'm a
		stranger in this country, I don't
		know the customs very well.  Let me
		say this, I meant no disrespect to
		you or her...

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

				VITELLI
			  (shrugs)
		Who are you and what do you want
		from my daughter?

				MICHAEL
		I am an American hiding in Sicily
		from the police of my country.  My
		name is Michael.  You can inform
		the police and make your fortune
		but then your daughter would lose a
		father rather than gain a husband.
		In any case, I want to meet your
		daughter.  With your permission and
		under the supervision of your
		family.  With all decorum.  With
		all respect.  I am an honorable man.

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
	asks:

				VITELLI
		Are you a friend of the friends?

				MICHAEL
		When the proper time comes, I'll
		tell you everything that a wife's
		father should know.

				FABRIZZIO
		It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

				VITELLI
			  (formally)
		Come Sunday morning:  My name is
		Vitelli and my house is up there on
		the hill, above the village.

				MICHAEL
		Your daughter's name?

				VITELLI
		Appolonia.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
	Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
	Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
	best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
	luparas on their shoulders.

	DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
	rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

	The Sunday churchbells ring.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

	MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by
	the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
	MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
	Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
	Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to
	APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
	her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light
	at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

	She looks at him.

				APPOLONIA
		Grazia.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

	Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's
	cafe.

	MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,
	though they are all dressed differently.

	They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
	talking and talking.

	MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
	She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

	MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
	seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

	As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
	half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
	further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
	their shoulders.

	Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
	and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains
	her balance, and they continue walking.

	Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

	Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and
	dissonant, plays.

	There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
	the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
	hundred years ago.

	Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
	flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
	confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
	countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

	We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
	all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
	Sicily.

	APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
	despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

	CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
	great wedding celebration.  It is held in the Village
	Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
	tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

	MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
	fills the room.

	He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.  A
	little frightened; but lovely.

	He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
	looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

	Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up
	to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

	She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

	Morning.  MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
	room.

	APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
	covered by the bedsheets.

	He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

	We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
	erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
	hitting th inner court wall.

	APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be
	frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

	Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
	guard duty.

	The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

				MICHAEL
		It's safer to teach you English.

				APPOLONIA
		Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
		Thursday, Friday...See, I learned
		it.  Now teach me to drive!

	DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Ciao, Don Tommassino.

	APPOLONIA kisses him.

				MICHAEL
		Things went badly in Palermo?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		The younger men have no respect.
		Things are changing; I don't know
		what will happen.  Michael, because
		of the wedding, people now know
		your name.

				MICHAEL
		Is that why there are more men on
		the walls?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Even so, I don't think it is safe
		here anymore.  I've made plans to
		move you to a villa near Siracuse.
		You must go right away.

				MICHAEL
		What is it?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Bad news from America.  Your
		brother, Santino.  He has been
		killed.

	For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
	Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	Morning.  MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

	Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
	combing his thick hair.

	MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

				MICHAEL
		Get the car.  I'll be leaving in
		ten minutes.  Where's Calo?

				FABRIZZIO
		Calo is having a cup of coffee in
		the kitchen.  Is your wife coming
		with you?

				MICHAEL
		No, she's going home to her family.
		She'll join me in a few weeks...

	INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

	MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
	kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he
	sees MICHAEL.

				CALO
		Should I get your bag?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?

				CALO
			  (smiling)
		She is sitting in the driver's seat
		of the car, dying to step on the
		gas.  She'll be a real American
		woman before she gets to America.

	MICHAEL smiles.

				MICHAEL
		Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
		the car.

	He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

	He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
	seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

	CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
	seat.

	Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

	Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
	disappear through the gate.

				MICHAEL
			  (muttering to himself)
		Where the hell is he going?

	MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

	MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
	courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

	APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
	where he is.

				APPOLONIA
			  (calling out)
		I'll drive to you.

	He smiles affectionately.

	CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
	by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the
	smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds
	out his hand.

				MICHAEL
		No.  No!

	His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
	as she switched on the ignition.

	Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
	and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

	MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

	INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

	MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear
	whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft
	cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON
	TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and
	from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

				MICHAEL
		Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know
		that the one who gives me Fabrizzio
		will own the finest pastures in
		Sicily.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

	Easter.

	A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes
	of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
	and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
	searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
	Easter eggs.

	The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
	baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
	his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

	Suddenly, he stops and looks.

	MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

	Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
	MICHAEL's direction.

	MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
	and embraces him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Be my son...

	INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

	DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
	building.

				DON CORLEONE
		This old building has seen its day.
		No way to do business...too small,
		too old.

	They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

				DON CORLEONE
		Have you thought about a wife?  A
		family?

				MICHAEL
			  (pained)
		No.

				DON CORLEONE
		I understand, Michael.  But you
		must make a family, you know.

				MICHAEL
		I want children, I want a family.
		But I don't know when.

				DON CORLEONE
		Accept what's happened, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I could accept everything that's
		happened; I could accept it, but
		that I never had a choice.  From
		the time I was born, you had laid
		this all out for me.

				DON CORLEONE
		No, I wanted other things for you.

				MICHAEL
		You wanted me to be your son.

				DON CORLEONE
		Yes, but sons who would be
		professors, scientists,
		musicians...and grandchildren who
		could be, who knows, a Governor, a
		President even, nothing's impossible
		here in America.

				MICHAEL
		Then why have I become a man like
		you?

				DON CORLEONE
		You are like me, we refuse to be
		fools, to be puppets dancing on a
		string pulled by other men.  I
		hoped the time for guns and killing
		and massacres was over.  That was
		my misfortune.  That was your
		misfortune.  I was hunted on the
		streets of Corleone when I was
		twelve years old because of who my
		father was.  I had no choice.

				MICHAEL
		A man has to choose what he will be.
		I believe that.

				DON CORLEONE
		What else do you believe in?

	MICHAEL doesn't answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family.  Can you
		believe in your country?  Those
		Pezzonovante of the State who
		decide what we shall do with our
		lives?  Who declare wars they wish
		us to fight in to protect what they
		own.  Do you put your fate in the
		hands of men whose only talent is
		that they tricked a bloc of people
		to vote for them?  Michael, in five
		years the Corleone family can be
		completely legitimate.  Very
		difficult things have to happen to
		make that possible.  I can't do
		them anymore, but you can, if you
		choose to.

	MICHAEL listens.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family; believe in a
		Code of Honor, older and higher,
		believe in Roots that go back
		thousands of years into your Race.
		Make a family, Michael, and protect
		it.  These are our affairs, sono cosa
		nostra, Governments only protect
		men who have their own individual
		power.  Be one of those men...you
		have the choice.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

	A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		There's a new one.  Construction
		going on everywhere.

	MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the
	bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		That's one of the family's new ones.
		Not bad, eh?

	EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

	The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

	Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,
	NERI, quiet and sinister.

				MICHAEL
		Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
		airport?

				FREDO
		He had business at the hotel, but
		he'll drop in for dinner.

	From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a
	discourtesy.

	INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

	A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of
	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI.  Great fuss is made.  They are
	being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

				FREDO
		You look wonderful, kid; really
		wonderful.  That doctor did some
		job on your face.

				MICHAEL
		You look good, too.

	They enter the suite.

				FREDO
		Nice, eh?

	FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the
	bellboys, waiters and maids.

				FREDO
			  (hurrying into the bedroom)
		Kid, take a look-see.

	MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

	There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,
	mirrors to each side.  FREDO points upward.

	A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

				FREDO
		Ever seen anything like that before?

				MICHAEL
			  (dryly)
		No.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom.  He is just finishing
	dressing; he puts on his jacket.  From the window, with the
	lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night.  MICHAEL
	passes into the other room.

	He stops, looks.  He is disturbed.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;
	a lavish table setting for eight.  Standing by the table are
	HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,
	beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
	NERI stands quietly by the door.

				FREDO
		Mike!  The party starting!

				MICHAEL
		Come here a minute, Fredo.

	FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

				MICHAEL
		Who are those girls?

				FREDO
			  (jokingly)
		That's for you to find out.

				MICHAEL
		Give them some money and send them
		home.

				FREDO
		Mike!

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of them...

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
	MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Corleone family is
		thinking of selling out all our
		interests in the Olive Oil business
		and settling here.  Moe Greene will
		sell us his interest so it can be
		wholly owned by friends of the
		family.

	FREDDIE seems anxious.

				FREDO
		Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
		He never mentioned it to me and he
		loves the business.

				MICHAEL
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Don wants you to help
		us get started.  We figure
		entertainment will be the big
		factor in drawing gamblers.  We
		hope you'll sign a contract to
		appear five times a year for maybe
		a week long engagement.
		We hope your friends in the movies
		will do the same.  We count on you
		to convince them.

				JOHNNY
		Sure, I'll do anything for my
		Godfather.  You know that, Mike.

	There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,
	who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,
	followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed
	in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast
	style.

				MOE
		Mike, good to see you.  Got
		everything you want?

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

				MOE
		The chef cooked for you special;
		the dancers will kick your tongue
		out and you credit is good!
			  (to his BODYGUARDS)
		Draw chips for all these people so
		they can play on the house.

				MICHAEL
		Is my credit good enough to buy you
		out?

	MOE laughs.

				MOE
		Buy me out?...

				MICHAEL
		The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone
		family wants to buy you out.

	GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes
	the BODYGUARDS.

				MOE
			  (furious)
		The Corleone family wants to buy me
		out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy
		me out.

				MICHAEL
		Your casino loses money.  Maybe we
		can do better.

				MOE
		You think I scam?

				MICHAEL
			  (the worst insult)
		You're unlucky.

				MOE
		You goddamn dagos.  I do you a
		favor and take Freddie in when
		you're having a bad time, and then
		you try to push me out.

				MICHAEL
		You took Freddie in because the
		Corleone family bankrolled your
		casino.  You and the Corleone
		family are evened out.  This is for
		business; name your price.

				MOE
		The Corleone family don't have that
		kind of muscle anymore.  The
		Godfather is sick.  You're getting
		chased out of New York by Barzini
		and the other families, and you
		think you can find easier pickings
		here.  I've talked to Barzini; I
		can make a deal with him and keep
		my hotel!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly, deadly)
		Is that why you thought you could
		slap Freddie around in public?

				FREDO
			  (his face turns red)
		Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe
		didn't mean anything.  He flies off
		the handle sometimes; but me and
		him are good friends.  Right, Moe?

				MOE
		Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick
		asses to make this place run right.
		Freddie and I had a little argument
		and I had to straighten him out.

				MICHAEL
		You straightened my brother out?

				MOE
		Hell, he was banging cocktail
		waitresses two at a time.  Players
		couldn't get a drink.

	MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

				MICHAEL
		I have to go back to New York
		tomorrow.  Think of your price.

				MOE
		You son of a bitch, you think you
		can brush me off like that?  I made
		my bones when you were going out
		with cheerleaders.

				FREDO
			  (frightened)
		Tom, you're the Consigliere; you
		can talk to the Don and advise him.

				MICHAEL
		The Don has semi-retired.  I'm
		running the Family business now.
		So anything you have to say, say it
		to me.

	Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
	MOE exits angrily.

				MICHAEL
		Freddie, you're my older brother.
		I love you.  But don't ever take
		sides with anybody against the
		Family again.

	EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

	KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark
	AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

	She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who
	plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

	Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have
	learned to tell are bodyguards.

	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO
	PORTERS carrying luggage.

	NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

	MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

	LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and
	MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically,
	the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;
	and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the
	other cars.

	And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other
	sedans.

	INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

	The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

				MICHAEL
		I have to see my father and his
		people when we get back to the Mall.

				KAY
		Oh Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go to the show tomorrow
		night--we can change the tickets.

				KAY
		Don't you want dinner first?

				MICHAEL
		No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

				KAY
		Wake me up when you come to bed?

	The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding
	limousine window.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The limousine arrives at the Mall.  We are inside.

				KAY
		Your sister wants to ask you
		something.

				MICHAEL
		Let HER ask.

	NERI opens the door.  KAY wants to talk just a little more.

				KAY
		She's afraid to.  Michael...

	MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment
	longer.

				KAY
		Why are you so cold to her and
		Carlo?  They live with us on the
		Mall now, but you never get close
		to them.

				MICHAEL
		I'm busy.

				KAY
		Connie and Carlo want you to be
		godfather to their little boy.

	NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

	He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

				KAY
		Will you?

				MICHAEL
		Let me think about it, O.K.?

	She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY
	and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

	VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.  He
	wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.  He sits in a
	chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Barzini's people chisel my territory
		and we do nothing about it.  Pretty
		soon there won't be one place in
		Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Just be patient.

				TESSIO
		I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
		Just take off the handcuffs.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Be patient.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at
		least recruit our regimes to full
		strength.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No, I don't want to give Barzini an
		excuse to start fighting.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Mike, you're wrong.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

	The OLD MAN looks up.  CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
	Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.  NERI stands by the door;
	HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

				CLEMENZA
		You said there would come a day
		when Tessio and me could form our
		own Families.  Only with your
		benediction, of course.  I ask
		permission...

				DON CORLEONE
		My son is head of the Family now.
		If you have his permission, you
		have my good will.

				MICHAEL
		In six months you can break off
		from the Corleone Family and go on
		your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on
		you to make the move to Nevada;
		you'll be my right-hand man out
		there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the
		Consigliere.

	Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
	He remains inexpressive.

				MICHAEL
		He's going to be our lawyer in
		Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any
		other business as of now, this
		minute.  No reflection on Tom;
		that's the way I want it.  Besides,
		if I ever need any advice, who's a
		better Consigliere than my father.

				CLEMENZA
		Then in a six month time we're on
		our own; is that it?

				MICHAEL
		Maybe less...

				TESSIO
		Let us fill up our Regimes.

				MICHAEL
		No.  I want things very calm for
		another six months.

				TESSIO
		Forgive me, Godfather, let our
		years of friendship be my excuse.
		How can you hope for success there
		without your strength here to back
		you up?  The two  go hand in hand.
		And with you gone from here the
		Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
		too strong for us.

				CLEMENZA
		And I don't like Barzini.  I say
		the Corleone Family has to move
		from strength, not weakness.  We
		should build our Regimes and take
		back our lost territories in Staten
		Island, at least.

				DON CORLEONE
		Do you have faith in my judgement?

				CLEMENZA
		Yes, Godfather...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then do what Michael says...

				MICHAEL
		All I can say is that things are
		being resolved that are more
		effective than a thousand buttonmen
		on the streets.  Understood?

	There are uneasy looks all around.

				CARLO
		Understood.  I just wish I was
		doing more to help out.

				MICHAEL
		I'll come to you when I need you.

	He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod,
	reluctantly.

				MICHAEL
		All right, then it's resolved.

	NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

	CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
	then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
	corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

	Then NERI closes the door.

	MICHAEL relaxes.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why are you cutting me out of
		the action?

				MICHAEL
		Tom, we're going to be legitimate
		all the way, and you're the legal
		man.  What could be more important
		than that.

				HAGEN
		I'm not talking about that.  I'm
		talking about Rocco Lampone building
		a secret regime.  Why does Neri
		report directly to you, rather than
		through me or a caporegime?

				DON CORLEONE
		I told you that it wouldn't escape
		his eye.

				MICHAEL
		How did you find out?

				HAGEN
		Bookkeepers know everything.
		Rocco's men are all a little too
		good for the jobs they're supposed
		to be doing.  They get a little
		more money than the job's worth.
			  (pause)
		Lampone's a good man; he's operating
		perfectly.

				MICHAEL
		Not so perfectly if you noticed.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why am I out?

				MICHAEL
		You're not a wartime Consigliere.
		Things may get tough with the move
		we're trying.

				HAGEN
		OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
		You're going about it all wrong;
		you're making the move out of
		weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
		if he tears you apart, the other
		families won't come running to help
		the Corleones...

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, I never thought you were a bad
		Consigliere, I thought Santino a
		bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a
		good heart but he wasn't the right
		man to head the family when I had
		my misfortune.  Michael has all my
		confidence, as you do.  For reasons
		which you can't know, you must have
		no part in what will happen.

				HAGEN
		Maybe I can help.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You're out, Tom.

	TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM
	leaves.

	MICHAEL looks at NERI.

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to talk to my father.

	NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,
	breathes in the air, and steps outside.

	EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

				DON CORLEONE
		I see you have your Luca Brasi.

				MICHAEL
		I'll need him.

				DON CORLEONE
		There are men in this world who
		demand to be killed.  They argue in
		gambling games; they jump out of
		their cars in a rage if someone so
		much as scratches their fender.
		These people wander through the
		streets calling out "Kill me, kill
		me."  Luca Brasi was like that.
		And since he wasn't scared of
		death, and in fact, looked for
		it...I made him my weapon.  Because
		I was the only person in the world
		that he truly hoped would not kill
		him.  I think you have done the
		same with this man.

	They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,
	peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
	MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then
	stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

				DON CORLEONE
		Barzini will move against you first.

				MICHAEL
		How?

				DON CORLEONE
		He will get in touch with you
		through someone you absolutely
		trust.  That person will arrange a
		meeting, guarantee your safety...

	He rises, and looks at Michael...

				DON CORLEONE
		...and at that meeting you will be
		assassinated.

	The DON walks on further.

				DON CORLEONE
		Your wife and children...you're
		happy with them?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.

	MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

				MICHAEL
		I've always respected you...

	A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

				DON CORLEONE
		And I...you.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
	them off.

				KAY
		How is your husband feeling?

				MAMA
		He's not the same since they shot
		him.  He lets Michael do all the
		work.  He just plays the fool with
		his garden, his peppers, his
		tomatoes, as if he was some peasant
		still.  But men are like that...

	She stops toward the Church.

				MAMA
		You come in, too.

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
		The Priest ain't gonna bite you
		cause you're not Catholic.
			  (whispered)
		He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

	KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
	They enter.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
	the holy water.

				MAMA
		You can.

	Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
	blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
	awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
	the Altar.

	MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a
	large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
	candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
	her some.

	MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
	taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
	dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
	twenty candles.

	She finishes, and bows her head.

	EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

	Very few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black
	flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
	An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
	Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

	Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show
	these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to
	Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The
	Sacred Heart"...

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Silence.

	The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
	all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

	Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
	wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
	somber and respectful.

	MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
	which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of
	Don Corleone.

	BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
	family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
	with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

	The VIEW ALTERS,

	and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
	openly falling, takes his turn.

	Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
	look at the great man.

	CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE
	immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
	Families to pay their respects.

	First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP
	TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

	Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

	MICHAEL watches the scene.

	BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
	by his men.

	As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
	him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
	from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
	he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
	Corleone.

	MICHAEL watches silently.

	BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First
	CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.

	CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He
	embraces and comforts her.

	Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
	all who come close to him.

	EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

	Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
	still hundreds of mourners.

	A young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18.

				GIRL
		Do you remember me?

				TESSIO
		No...

				GIRL
		We danced together at Connie's
		wedding.

	TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
	and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He
	finds him.

				TESSIO
		Mike, could I have a minute?

	MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close
	by.

				TESSIO
		Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
		Says we can straighten any of our
		problems out.

				MICHAEL
		He talked to you?

				TESSIO
			  (nods)
		I can arrange security.

	MICHAEL looks at him.

	EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

	The Cemetery.  Late day.

	The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
	stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
	Queens Village.

	Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
	pictures, etc.

	MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Christ, Tom; I needed more time
		with him.  I really needed him.

				HAGEN
		Did he give you his politicians?

				MICHAEL
		Not all...I needed another four
		months and I would have had them
		all.
			  (he looks at TOM)
		I guess you've figured it all out?

				HAGEN
		How will they come at you?

				MICHAEL
		I know now.
			  (a passion wells up
			  inside of MICHAEL)
		I'll make them call me Don.

				HAGEN
		Have you agreed on a meeting?

				MICHAEL
			  (nods)
		A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn
		on Tessio's ground, where I'll be
		safe.

	HAGEN looks at him; understands.

				MICHAEL
		But after the Baptism.  I've
		decided to stand as godfather to
		Connie's baby.

	They look up.

	The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
	stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
	with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

	ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
	pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we
	see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
	uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
	Then the badge, and the identification card; with his
	picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
	begins to dress.

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
	their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
	beginning to take on a matronly look.

	INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

	In a Long Island motel.

	ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,
	checks it, and puts it back together.

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

	PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates,
	takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
	gets in, drives off.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The Church.

	Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
	Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
	Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

	CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the
	infant; showing him off to interested people.

	EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

	NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN
	Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a
	policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

	LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort
	Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
	"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY".

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.

	CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and
	MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

				PRIEST
			  (to MICHAEL)
		Do you pledge to guide and protect
		this child if he is left fatherless?
		Do you promise to shield him
		against the wickedness of the world?

				MICHAEL
		Yes, I promise.

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

	NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He
	continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On
	his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
	across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he
	approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
	nightstick.

	The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

	NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.

	The DRIVER turns his head away.

				NERI
		OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
		you wanna move?

				DRIVER
			  (obviously a hood)
		You better check with your precinct.

				NERI
		Move it!

	The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
	and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
	jacket.

	NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then
	he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

				NERI
		Let me see you license and
		registration.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

	LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
	It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he
	returns into the room.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He
	rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently
	applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

				PRIEST
		Ephetha...be opened...So you may
		perceive the fragrance of God's
		sweetness.

	EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

	The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center
	is arguing with NERI.

	Now the DRIVER looks up.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
	glass doors.

	NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
	doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
	BARZINI within them.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him
	the infant.

				PRIEST
		Do you renounce Satan.

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce him.

				PRIEST
		And all his works?

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce them.

	INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

	LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
	the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
	PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a
	semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

	They are riddled with gunfire.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with
	his package.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant
	MICHAEL holds.

				PRIEST
		Do you wish to be baptized?

				MICHAEL
		I do wish to be baptized.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

	CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

	He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate
	elevator waiting shaft.

	The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

	The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with
	the dapper MOE GREENE.

	CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

	The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

				PRIEST
		I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

	Flash bulbs go off.  Everyone is smiles, and crowds around
	MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The christening party outside the Church.

	Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
	receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

	Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

	As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out
	and works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This
	is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

	CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

				CONNIE
		Kiss your Godfather.

	The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
	excuse to back away.

				MICHAEL
		Carlo...we've had a change in the
		plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the
		kids will have to take the trip out
		to Vegas without us.

				CONNIE
		Oh Mike, it's our first vacation
		together.

				CARLO
			  (anxious to please)
		Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

				MICHAEL
		Go back to your house and wait for
		me...

	He kisses KAY.

				MICHAEL
			  (to KAY)
		I'll just be a couple of days...

	People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to
	drive off.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

	TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

	HAGEN enters.

				HAGEN
		You'd better make your call to
		Barzini; Michael's ready.

	TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

				TESSIO
		We're on our way to Brooklyn.

	He hangs up and smiles.

				TESSIO
		I hope Mike can get us a good deal
		tonight.

				HAGEN
			  (gravely)
		I'm sure he will.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.  On their
	way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

				BUTTON MAN
		The boss says he'll come in a
		separate car.  He says for you two
		to go on ahead.

				TESSIO
			  (frowning)
		Hell, he can't do that.  It screws
		up all my arrangements.

	THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

				HAGEN
			  (gently)
		I can't go with you either, Tessio.

	He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
	panics, and then he accepts it.

				TESSIO
			  (after the pause)
		Tell Mike it was business...I
		always liked him.

				HAGEN
		He understands that.

	TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

				TESSIO
			  (softly)
		Tom, can you get me off the hook?
		For old times' sake?

				HAGEN
		I can't.

	HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about
	twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

	TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

	HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather
	nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
	LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

	They move toward us.

	Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

	He wears a broad smile.

				CARLO
		Godfather!

				MICHAEL
		You have to answer for Santino.

	The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
	attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
	backs into the living room.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	The door opens, and the grim party enters.

				MICHAEL
		You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
		people.  That little farce you
		played out with my sister.  Did
		Barzini kid you that would fool a
		Corleone?

				CARLO
			  (dignity)
		I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on
		the head of my children, I'm
		innocent.  Mike, don't do this to
		me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		Barzini is dead.  So is Philip
		Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
		and Moe Greene...I want to square
		all the family accounts tonight.
		So don't tell me you're innocent;
		admit what you did.

	CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

				MICHAEL
			  (almost kindly)
		Don't be frightened.  Do you think
		I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
		think I'd make your children
		fatherless?  After all, I'm
		Godfather to your son.  No, your
		punishment is that you're out of
		the family business.  I'm putting
		you on a plane to Vegas--and I want
		you to stay there.  I'll send
		Connie an allowance, that's all.
		But don't keep saying you're
		innocent; it insults my intelligence
		and makes me angry.  Who approached
		you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

				CARLO
			  (sees his way out)
		Barzini.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Good, good.  Leave now; there's a
		car waiting to take you to the
		airport.

	CARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting;
	with a group of MEN around it.

	He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

				MICHAEL
		I'll call your wife and tell her
		what flight you're on.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his
	things in the trunk.

	ONE opens the front door for him.

	SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

	CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
	to see the other man.

	It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

	The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
	suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes
	and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

	The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

	His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

	Then the body goes slack.

	CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
	drives off.

	EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

	MICHAEL and his party.  They watch.

	Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

	MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

	They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights
	flash by.

	NERI turns back.

				NERI
		You know I would never question
		anything you say.

				MICHAEL
			  (smiles)
		Speak your mind.

				NERI
		I'll do this for you; you know I
		should.

				MICHAEL
		No.  This I have to do.

	EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

	MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
	Italian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door.

				MICHAEL
		Sit in the car.

	INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

	He walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza
	dough in the air.

				MICHAEL
		Where's the boss?

				MAN
		In the back.  Hey Frank, someone
		wants you.

	A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

				MAN
		What is it?

	He stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO.

	VIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is
	cut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
	these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
	indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

	A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
	the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
	restrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs
	across the Mall into Michael's house.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	Inside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed;
	furniture prepared for shipping.

				CONNIE
		Michael!

	She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
	MICHAEL and KAY.

				KAY
			  (comforting)
		Connie...

	But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI
	is watchful.

				CONNIE
		You lousy bastard; you killed my
		husband...

				KAY
		Connie...

				CONNIE
		You waited until our father died
		and nobody could stop you and you
		killed him, you killed him!  You
		blamed him about Sonny, you always
		did, everybody did.  But you never
		thought about me, never gave a damn
		about me.
			  (crying)
		What am I going to do now, what am
		I going to do.

	TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
	from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
	finish.

				KAY
		Connie, how could you say such
		things?

				CONNIE
		Why do you think he kept Carlo on
		the Mall?  All the time he knew he
		was going to kill my husband.  But
		he didn't dare while my father was
		alive.  And then he stood Godfather
		to our child.  That coldhearted
		bastard.
			  (to KAY)
		And do you know how many men he had
		killed with Carlo?  Just read the
		papers.  That's your husband.

	She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
	she has no saliva.

				MICHAEL
		Get her home and get a doctor.

	The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
	gently but firmly.

	KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
	MICHAEL.  He feels her look.

				MICHAEL
		She's hysterical.

	But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

				KAY
		Michael, it's not true.  Please
		tell me.

				MICHAEL
		Don't ask me.

				KAY
		Tell me!

				MICHAEL
		All right, this one time I'll let
		you ask about my affairs, one last
		time.

				KAY
		Is it true?

	She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
	directly that we know he will tell the truth.

				MICHAEL
			  (after a very long pause)
		No.

	KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
	him.  Then she kisses him.

				KAY
			  (through her tears)
		We both need a drink.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

	She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
	drinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
	drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
	house with their BODYGUARDS.

	She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
	them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
	foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a
	Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

	CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

				CLEMENZA
		Don Corleone...

	The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
	husband has become.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY wears a shawl over her hand.  She drops many coins in
	the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
	a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

THIRD DRAFT				PARAMOUNT PICTURES
					1 Gulf and Western Plaza
March 29, 1971				New York, New York 10019





	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
	background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
	simple words in white lettering:

				  THE GODFATHER

	While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."
	Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
	man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
	emotion.

				BONASERA
		America has made my fortune.

	As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

				BONASERA
		I raised my daughter in the American
		fashion; I gave her freedom, but
		taught her never to dishonor her
		family.  She found a boy friend,
		not an Italian.  She went to the
		movies with him, stayed out late.
		Two months ago he took her for a
		drive, with another boy friend.
		They made her drink whiskey and
		then they tried to take advantage
		of her.  She resisted; she kept her
		honor.  So they beat her like an
		animal.  When I went to the hospital
		her nose was broken, her jaw was
		shattered and held together by
		wire, and she could not even weep
		because of the pain.

	He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

				BONASERA
		I went to the Police like a good
		American.  These two boys were
		arrested and brought to trial.  The
		judge sentenced them to three years
		in prison, and suspended the
		sentence.  Suspended sentence!
		They went free that very day.  I
		stood in the courtroom like a fool,
		and those bastards, they smiled at
		me.  Then I said to my wife, for
		Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

	By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
	in his home.

	The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
	patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the
	shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small
	table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
	impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
	glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
	voices of many people outside.

				DON CORLEONE
		Bonasera, we know each other for
		years, but this is the first time
		you come to me for help.  I don't
		remember the last time you invited
		me to your house for coffee...even
		though our wives are friends.

				BONASERA
		What do you want of me?  I'll give
		you anything you want, but do what
		I ask!

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is that Bonasera?

	BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  You ask for too much.

				BONASERA
		I ask for Justice.

				DON CORLEONE
		The Court gave you justice.

				BONASERA
		An eye for an eye!

				DON CORLEONE
		But your daughter is still alive.

				BONASERA
		Then make them suffer as she
		suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

	Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

				DON CORLEONE
		You never think to protect yourself
		with real friends.  You think it's
		enough to be an American.  All
		right, the Police protects you,
		there are Courts of Law, so you
		don't need a friend like me.
		But now you come to me and say Don
		Corleone, you must give me justice.
		And you don't ask in respect or
		friendship.  And you don't think to
		call me Godfather; instead you come
		to my house on the day my daughter
		is to be married and you ask me to
		do murder...for money.

				BONASERA
		America has been good to me...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then take the justice from the
		judge, the bitter with the sweet,
		Bonasera.  But if you come to me
		with your friendship, your loyalty,
		then your enemies become my enemies,
		and then, believe me, they would
		fear you...

	Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

				BONASERA
		Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

				BONASERA
		Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Some day, and that day may never
		come, I would like to call upon you
		to do me a service in return.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There
	are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
	and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and
	countless tables covered with food and wine.

	DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
	son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
	the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
	hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
	children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry
	with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
	bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

	The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
	MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
	and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
	bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into
	the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

				DON CORLEONE
		Where's Michael?

				SONNY
		He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

				DON CORLEONE
		Then the picture will wait for him.

	Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
	back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
	direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns
	it.  Then he moves to his wife.

				SONNY
		Sandra, watch the kids.  They're
		running wild.

				SANDRA
		You watch yourself.

	HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
	barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM
	crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
	next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

	EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
	working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
	of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
	down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter
	coming from the party in the distance.

	A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

	BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
	watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
	embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
	bumpers.

	PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
	bellies with the ladies.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie...wine...WINE.

	He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
	PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
	it to him.

				PAULIE
		You look terrif on the floor!

				CLEMENZA
		What are you, a dance judge?  Go do
		your job; take a walk around the
		neighborhood... see everything is
		okay.

	PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
	back into the dance.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.

	TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
	OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
	enormous brown shoes.

	The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
	of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
	CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Buddy, this is a private party.

	The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
	sedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
	The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
	without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the
	ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
	and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the
	walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
	dark study.

				NAZORINE
		...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
		by the American Army, and sent to
		New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

				DON CORLEONE
		Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I
		can do.

				NAZORINE
		Now that the war is over, Enzo,
		this boy is being repatriated to
		Italy.  And you see, Godfather...
			  (he wrings his hands,
			  unable to express himself)
		He...my daughter...they...

				DON CORLEONE
		You want him to stay in this country.

				NAZORINE
		Godfather, you understand everything.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, what we need is an Act of
		Congress to allow Enzo to become a
		citizen.

				NAZORINE
			  (impressed)
		An Act of Congress!

				HAGEN
			  (nodding)
		It will cost.

	The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
	nods.

				NAZORINE
		Is that all?  Godfather, thank
		you...
			  (backing out, enthusiastically)
		Oh, wait till you see the cake I
		made for your beautiful daughter!

	NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
	DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

				HAGEN
		Who do I give this job to?

	The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

				DON CORLEONE
		Not to one of our paisans...give it
		to a Jew Congressman in another
		district.  Who else is on the list
		for today?

	The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
	to see him.

				HAGEN
		Francesco Nippi.  His nephew has
		been refused parole.  A bad case.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		His father worked with you in the
		freight yards when you were young.

	LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		He's not on the list, but Luca
		Brasi wants to see you.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is it necessary?

				HAGEN
		You understand him better than
		anyone.

	The DON nods to this.  Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
	leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
	stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
	following them.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
	her to his GIRL.

	EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
	burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She
	is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
	the vitality.

				KAY
		I've never seen anything like it.

				MICHAEL
		I told you I had a lot of relatives.

	KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
	We see what she sees:

	Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
	barrels.

				KAY
			  (amused)
		Michael, what are those men doing?

				MICHAEL
		They're waiting to see my father.

				KAY
		They're talking to themselves.

				MICHAEL
		They're going to talk to my father,
		which means they're going to ask
		him for something, which means they
		better get it right.

				KAY
		Why do they bother him on a day
		like this?

				MICHAEL
		Because they know that no Sicilian
		will refuse a request on his
		daughter's wedding day.

	EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

	CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
	overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He
	is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
	She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
	him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
	envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
	holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
	of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
	where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
	CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
	bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
	things hold.

	Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

				CARLO
			  (whispered)
		Cut it out, Connie.

	The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
	is fat with money.

				PAULIE (O.S.)
		What do you think?  Twenty grand?

	A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
	prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
	eyes from the purse.

				PAULIE
		Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty,
		thirty grand in small bills cash in
		that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if
		this was somebody else's wedding!

	SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
	MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he
	glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
	some WOMEN.

	He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

	SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

				WOMAN
		Is it true what they say about your
		husband, Sandra?

	SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
	further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
	Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
	SONNY and LUCY are gone.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

	The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY
	surreptitiously steps out.

	She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
	motioning for her to come up.

	She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL.

				KAY
			  (in a spooky low tone)
		Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a
		relative?

	She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

				MICHAEL
		No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You
		wouldn't like him.

				KAY
			  (Excited)
		Who is he?

				MICHAEL
			  (Sizing her up)
		You really want to know?

				KAY
		Yes.  Tell me.

				MICHAEL
		You like spaghetti?

				KAY
		You know I love spaghetti.

				MICHAEL
		Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
		tell you a Luca Brasi story.

	She starts to eat her spaghetti.

	She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

				MICHAEL
		Once upon a time, about fifteen
		years ago some people wanted to
		take over my father's olive oil
		business.  They had Al Capone send
		some men in from Chicago to kill my
		father, and they almost did.

				KAY
		Al Capone!

				MICHAEL
		My Father sent Luca Brasi after
		them.  He tied the two Capone men
		hand and foot, and stuffed small
		bath towels into their mouths.
		Then he took an ax, and chopped one
		man's feet off...

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		Then the legs at the knees...

				KAY
		Michael you're trying to scare me...

				MICHAEL
		Then the thighs where they joined
		the torso.

				KAY
		Michael, I don't want to hear
		anymore...

				MICHAEL
		Then Luca turned to the other man...

				KAY
		Michael, I love you.

				MICHAEL
		...who out of sheer terror had
		swallowed the bath towel in his
		mouth and suffocated.

	The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
	tall story.

				KAY
		I never know when you're telling me
		the truth.

				MICHAEL
		I told you you wouldn't like him.

				KAY
		He's coming over here!

	LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
	their table.

				MICHAEL
		Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
		Adams.

				KAY
			  (having survived LUCA)
		How do you do.

				MICHAEL
		My brother, Tom Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Hello Kay.  Your father's inside,
		doing some business.
			  (privately)
		He's been asking for you.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks Tom.

	HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
	following.

				KAY
		If he's your brother, why does he
		have a different name?

				MICHAEL
		My brother Sonny found him living
		in the streets when he was a kid,
		so my father took him in.  He's a
		good lawyer.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the
	YOUNG COUPLE.

				LUCA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...

	THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
	forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his
	jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
	a formal speech.

				LUCA
			  (with difficulty)
		Don Corleone...I am honored, and
		grateful...that you invited me to
		your home...on the wedding day of
		your...daughter.
		May their first child...be a
		masculine child.  I pledge my never
		ending loyalty.
			  (he offers the envelope)
		For your daughter's bridal purse.

				DON CORLEONE
		Thank you, Luca, my most valued
		friend.

	THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
	tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

				LUCA
		Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I
		know you are busy.

	He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
	the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes
	more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'm sure it's the most generous
		gift today.

				HAGEN
		The Senator called--apologized for
		not coming personally, but said
		you'd understand.  Also, some of
		the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
		And another call from Virgil
		Sollozzo.

	DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

				HAGEN
		The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
		has contacts in Turkey for the
		poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
		process down to morphine or up to
		heroin.  Also he has access to this
		country.  He's coming to us for
		financial help, and some sort of
		immunity from the law.  For that we
		get a piece of the action, I
		couldn't find out how much.
		Sollozzo is vouched for by the
		Tattaglia family, and they may have
		a piece of the action.  They call
		Sollozzo the Turk.
		He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
		and is suppose to have a Turkish
		wife and kids.  He's suppose to be
		very quick with the knife, or was,
		when he was younger.  Only in
		matters of business and with some
		reasonable complaint.  Also he has
		an American wife and three children
		and he is a good family man.

	THE DON nods.

				HAGEN
		He's his own boss, and very
		competent.

				DON CORLEONE
		And with prison record.

				HAGEN
		Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
		United States.  He's known to the
		Government as a top narcotics man.
		That could be a plus for us; he
		could never get immunity to testify.

				DON CORLEONE
		When did he call?

				HAGEN
		This morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		On a day like this.  Consiglero, do
		you also have in your notes the the
		Turk made his living from
		Prostitution before the war, like
		the Tattaglias do now.  Write that
		down before you forget it.  The
		Turk will wait.

	We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
	from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.

				DON CORLEONE
		What that?  It sounds like Johnny.

	He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
	room with light.

				DON CORLEONE
		It is Johnny.  He came all the way
		from California to be at the wedding.

				HAGEN
		Should I bring him in.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You
		see?  He is a good godson.

				HAGEN
		It's been two years.  He's probably
		in trouble again.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
	excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

				KAY
		I didn't know your family knew
		Johnny Fontane.

				MICHAEL
		Sure.

				KAY
		I used to come down to New York
		whenever he sang at the Capitol and
		scream my head off.

				MICHAEL
		He's my father's godson; he owes
		him his whole career.

	JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
	They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

				DON CORLEONE
		My Godson has come three thousand
		miles to do us honor and no one
		thinks to wet his throat.

	At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
	takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

				JOHNNY
		I kept trying to call you after my
		divorce and Tom always said you
		were busy.  When I got the Wedding
		invitation I knew you weren't sore
		at me anymore, Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Can I do something for you still?
		You're not too rich, or too famous
		that I can't help you?

				JOHNNY
		I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
		and...my career, I'm almost washed
		up...

	He's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come
	with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to
	HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Santino to come in with us.
		He should hear some things.

	They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN glances up the staircase.

				HAGEN
		Sonny?

	Then he goes up.

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
	gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
	against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of
	petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

				LUCY
		Sonnyeeeeeeee.

	Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his
	body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze
	in that position.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, you in there?

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside, HAGEN by the door.

				HAGEN
		The old man wants you; Johnny's
		here...he's got a problem.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		Okay.  One minute.

	HAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the
	door again.  TOM leaves.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

				DON CORLEONE
		ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in
		Heaven, is it possible you turned
		out no better than a Hollywood
		finocchio.

	Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON
	smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
	adjusting his clothes.

				DON CORLEONE
		All right, Hollywood...Now tell me
		about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
		who won't let you work.

				JOHNNY
		He owns the studio.  Just a month
		ago he bought the movie rights to
		this book, a best seller.  And the
		main character is a guy just like
		me.  I wouldn't even have to act,
		just be myself.

	The DON is silent, stern.

				DON CORLEONE
		You take care of your family?

				JOHNNY
		Sure.

	He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
	he can.

				DON CORLEONE
		You look terrible.  I want you to
		eat well, to rest.  And spend time
		with your family.  And then, at the
		end of the month, this big shot
		will give you the part you want.

				JOHNNY
		It's too late.  All the contracts
		have been signed, they're almost
		ready to shoot.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
	to hurt.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now go back to the party and leave
		it to me.

	He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		When does my daughter leave with
		her bridegroom?

				HAGEN
		They'll cut the cake in a few
		minutes...leave right after that.
		Your new son-in-law, do we give him
		something important?

				DON CORLEONE
		No, give him a living.  But never
		let him know the family's business.
		What else, Tom?

				HAGEN
		I've called the hospital; they've
		notified Consiglere Genco's family
		to come and wait.  He won't last
		out the night.

	This saddens the DON.  He sighs.

				DON CORLEONE
		Genco will wait for me.  Santino,
		tell your brothers they will come
		with me to the hospital to see
		Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big
		car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

				SONNY
		And Michael?

				DON CORLEONE
		All my sons.
			  (to HAGEN)
		Tom, I want you to go to California
		tonight.  Make the arrangements.
		But don't leave until I come back
		from the hospital and speak to you.
		Understood?

				HAGEN
		Understood.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
	the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
	in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
	extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
	of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
	begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
	in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
	kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks
	hitting five hundred glasses.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Silence.

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A
	single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the
	driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
	sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

				DON CORLEONE
		Will your girl friend get back to
		the city all right?

				MICHAEL
		Tom said he'd take care of it.

	The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
	the gate of the great Corleone Mall.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

	A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
	see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
	all plump and dressed in black.

	DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the
	DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL
	stops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one
	another for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts
	his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
	uniform.

				DON CORLEONE
		What was this for?

				MICHAEL
		For bravery.

				DON CORLEONE
		And this?

				MICHAEL
		For killing a man.

				DON CORLEONE
		What miracles you do for strangers.

				MICHAEL
		I fought for my country.  It was my
		choice.

				DON CORLEONE
		And now, what do you choose to do?

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to finish school.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  When you are finished, come
		and talk to me.  I have hopes for
		you.

	Again they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,
	and continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
	follows.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
	VIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (whispered)
		Genco, I've brought my sons to pay
		their respects.  And look, even
		Johnny Fontane, all the way from
		Hollywood.

	GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE
	takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
	his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

				GENCO
		Godfather, Godfather, it's your
		daughter's wedding day, you cannot
		refuse me.  Cure me, you have the
		power.

				DON CORLEONE
		I have no such power...but Genco,
		don't fear death.

				GENCO
			  (with a sly wink)
		It's been arranged, then?

				DON CORLEONE
		You blaspheme.  Resign yourself.

				GENCO
		You need your old Consigliere.  Who
		will replace me?
			  (suddenly)
		Stay with me Godfather.  Help me
		meet death.  If he sees you, he
		will be frightened and leave me in
		peace.  You can say a word, pull a
		few strings, eh?  We'll outwit that
		bastard as we outwitted all those
		others.
			  (clutching his hand)
		Godfather, don't betray me.

	The DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.
	He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
	whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	FADE IN:

	The interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of
	the very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like
	any young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the
	difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
	during the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,
	bulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.

	INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

	The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his
	undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
	envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
	contents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
	bathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
	tries to get his interest.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE in his office.  LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Luca, I am worried about this man
		Sollozzo.  Find out what you can,
		through the Tattaglias.  Let them
		believe you could be tempted away
		from the Corleone Family, if the
		right offer was made.  Learn what
		he has under his fingernails...

	INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

	The hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs
	two steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
	him into the apartment.

	INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI's tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels
	and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
	trunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
	vest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
	puts on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly
	disassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

	INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New
	Hampshire.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty
	subway train.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN on the Constellation.  He reaches into his briefcase,
	and takes out several pictures and papers.

	One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm
	in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a
	lovely young child star to his immediate right.

	HAGEN considers other papers.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
	He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

				DON CORLEONE
		Remember my new Consigliere, a
		lawyer with his briefcase can steal
		more than a hundred men with guns.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

	JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
	armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,
	and TOM enters.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
	gardens, martinis in hand.

				WOLTZ
		You should have told me your boss
		was Corleone, Tom, I had to check
		you out.  I thought you were just
		some third rate hustler Johnny was
		running in to bluff me.
			  (a piece of statuary)
		Florence, thirteenth century.
		Decorated the garden of a king.

	They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

				WOLTZ
		I'm going to show you something
		beautiful.

	They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
	huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."
	TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
	rise as WOLTZ approaches.

				WOLTZ
		You like horses?  I like horses, I
		love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive
		Racehorses.

	The animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him
	with true love in his voice.

				WOLTZ
		Khartoum...Kartoum...You are
		looking at six hundred thousand
		dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even
		Russian Czars never paid that kind
		of dough for a single horse.  But
		I'm not going to race him I'm going
		to put him out to Stud.

	INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
	attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the
	walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

				HAGEN
		Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
		That is very close, a very sacred
		religious relationship.

				WOLTZ
		Okay, but just tell him this is one
		favor I can't give.  But he should
		try me again on anything else.

				HAGEN
		He never asks a second favor when
		he has been refused the first.
		Understood?

				WOLTZ
		You smooth son of a bitch, let me
		lay it on the line for you, and
		your boss.  Johnny Fontane never
		gets that movie.  I don't care how
		many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball
		Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

				HAGEN
		I'm German-Irish.

				WOLTZ
		Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny
		will never get that part because I
		hate that pinko punk and I'm going
		to run him out of the Movies.  And
		I'll tell you why.  He ruined one
		of Woltz Brothers' most valuable
		proteges.  For five years I had
		this girl under training; singing
		lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing
		lessons!  We spent hundreds of
		thousands of dollars--I was going
		to make her a star.  I'll be even
		more frank, just to show you that
		I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
		wasn't all dollars and cents.  That
		girl was beautiful and young and
		innocent and she was the greatest
		piece of ass I've ever ad and I've
		had them all over the world.  Then
		Johnny comes along with that olive
		oil voice and guinea charm and she
		runs off.  She threw it all away to
		make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN
		MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
		MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

	EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

	An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
	Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
	INC." next to an open-faced fruit market.

	A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
	cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
	the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
	before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very
	dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,
	and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of
	the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
	introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of
	handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
	introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
	glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
	They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are
	brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
	in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
	CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish
	with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
	one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
	that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

				SOLLOZZO
		My business is heroin, I have poppy
		fields, laboratories in Narseilles
		and Sicily, ready to go into
		production.  My importing methods
		are as safe as these things can be,
		about five per cent loss.  The risk
		is nothing, the profits enormous.

				DON CORLEONE
		Why do you come to me?  Why do I
		deserve your generosity?

				SOLLOZZO
		I need two million dollars in
		cash...more important, I need a
		friend who has people in high
		places; a friend who can guarantee
		that if one of my employees be
		arrested, they would get only light
		sentences.  Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		What percentages for my family?

				SOLLOZZO
		Thirty per cent.  In the first year
		your share would be four million
		dollars; then it would go up.

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is the percentage of the
		Tattaglia family?

	SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		My compliments.  I'll take care of
		them from my share.

				DON CORLEONE
		So.  I receive 30 per cent just for
		finance and legal protection.  No
		worries about operations, is that
		what you tell me?

				SOLLOZZO
		If you think two million dollars in
		cash is just finance, I congratulate
		you Don Corleone.

	There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
	the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		I said I would see you because I've
		heard you're a serious man, to be
		treated with respect...
			  (pause)
		But I'll say no to you.

	We feel this around the room.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll give you my reasons.  I have
		many, many friends in Politics.
		But they wouldn't be so friendly if
		my business was narcotics instead
		of gambling.  They think gambling
		is something like liquor, a harmless
		vice...and they think narcotics is
		dirty business.

	SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

				DON CORLEONE
		No...how a man makes his living is
		none of my business.  But this
		proposition of yours is too risky.
		All the people in my family lived
		well the last ten years, I won't
		risk that out of greed.

				SOLLOZZO
		Are you worried about security for
		your million?

				DON CORLEONE
		No.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Tattaglias will guarantee your
		investment also.

	This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

				SONNY
		The Tattaglia family guarantees our
		investment?

	SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
	him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
	of line.

				DON CORLEONE
		Young people are greedy, and they
		have no manners.  They speak when
		they should listen.  But I have a
		sentimental weakness for my
		children, and I've spoiled them, as
		you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my
		no is final.

	SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He
	glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do
	as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
	takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

	The DON turns to SONNY.

				DON CORLEONE
		Santino, never let anyone outside
		the family know what you are
		thinking.  I think your brain is
		going soft from all that comedy you
		play with that young girl.

	TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
	with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.

				DON CORLEONE
		What is this nonsense?

				HAGEN
		It's from Johnny.  It was announced
		this morning.  He's going to play
		the lead in the new Woltz Brothers
		film.

	INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
	presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room
	from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see
	his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;
	mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something
	wet.

	He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
	He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is
	frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
	his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of
	blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,
	moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
	with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
	his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy
	tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
	of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and
	the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
	with blood.

	WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.
	Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
	terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
	knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Send Johnny my congratulations.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

	Fifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are
	bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

	KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,
	carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

				KAY
		We have something for your mother,
		for Sonny, we have the tie for
		Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the
		Reynolds pen...

				MICHAEL
		And what do you want for Christmas?

				KAY
		Just you.

	They kiss.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS
	AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony
		at the City Hall, no big fuss, no
		family, just a couple of friends as
		witnesses.

	The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on
	the two single beds that they have pushed together.

				KAY
		What will your father say?

				MICHAEL
		As long as I tell him beforehand he
		won't object.  He'll be hurt, but
		he won't object.

				KAY
		What time do they expect us?

				MICHAEL
		For dinner.  Unless I call and tell
		them we're still in New Hampshire.

				KAY
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		Then we can have dinner, see a
		show, and spend one more night.

	He moves to the telephone.

				MICHAEL (CONT'D.)
		Operator.  Get me
			  (fill in number)


				KAY
		Michael, what are you doing?

				MICHAEL
		Shhh, you be the long distance
		operator.  Here.

				KAY
		Hello...this is Long Distance.  I
		have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr.
		Michael Corleone.  One moment please.

	She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

				MICHAEL
		Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah...
		listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm
		driving down to the city with Kay
		tomorrow morning.  There's something
		important I want to tell the old
		man before Christmas.  Will he be
		home tomorrow night?

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background,
	through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in
	his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sure.  Anything I can do for you.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas.
		Everyone's going to be out at Long
		Beach, right?

				HAGEN
		Right.

	He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of
	work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and
	hat, and continues out.

	He peeks into the DON's office.

				HAGEN
		Michael called; he's not leaving
		New Hampshire until tomorrow
		morning.  I've got to go, I promised
		Theresa I'd pick up some toys for
		the kids.

	The DON smiles and nods.

	TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
	FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the
	afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office
	manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,
	raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
	paper.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Paulie to get the car from the
		lot; I'll be ready to go home in a
		few minutes.

				FREDO
		I'll have to get it myself; Paulie
		called in sick this morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		That's the third time this month.
		I think maybe you'd better get a
		healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell
		Tom.

				FREDO
			  (going)
		Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick,
		he's sick.  I don't mind getting
		the car.

	FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out
	his window.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	FREDDIE crosses the street.

	INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

				OFFICE MANAGER
		Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

	The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the
	DON glances out his window.

	The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

				DON CORLEONE
		Merry Christmas.
			  (handing the MANAGER
			  an envelope)


	And he starts down the stairs.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When
	FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the
	driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to
	get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
	fruit stand near the corner.

	The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among
	the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
	piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
	pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON
	pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
	turns back to the car.

	EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

	TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift
	wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks,
	someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO.

	He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (quietly)
		Don't be frightened.  I just want
		to talk to you.

	A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (urgently)
		Get in; I want to talk to you.

	HAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened.

				HAGEN
		I haven't got time.

	TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

				SOLLOZZO
		Get in the car.  If I wanted to
		kill you you'd be dead already.
		Trust me.

	HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving
	our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story
	of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the
	car drive off.

	EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

	RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and
	MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and
	she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY
	nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk
	arm in arm.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		a nun?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		Ingrid Bergman?

	They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees
	something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do.
	MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

				KAY
			  (a little voice)
		Michael?

				MICHAEL
		I'm thinking about it.

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		No, I would not like you better if
		you were Ingrid Bergman.

	She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm,
	back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave.

	The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
	DOWN."

	MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a
	dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY
	knows to remain silent.

				MICHAEL
			  (desperately)
		They don't say if he's dead or alive.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the
	car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON
	drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness
	toward the parked car.

				DON CORLEONE
		Fredo, Fredo!

	The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
	rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

	Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,
	and continues toward the car.

	The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
	over an entire case of fruit.

	The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

	Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are
	more GUNSHOTS.

	FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
	having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun
	trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops
	the gun.

	The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

	The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed
	DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
	and pools of blood are beginning to form.

	The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
	they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

	The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
	rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
	from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
	windows.  But the street itself is now empty.

	FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
	puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
	face down in them.

	FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
	something we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.  He
	gets off.

	He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

	EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA walks down the late night street.  He approaches an
	elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still
	winking this late at night.  He waits and watches.  Then the
	sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

	INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
	glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the
	chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
	is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
	receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
	the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
	behind the bar.

				MAN
		Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

				LUCA
		I know.

	LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

				SOLLOZZO
		Do you know who I am?

	LUCA Nods.

				SOLLOZZO
		You've been talking to the
		Tattaglias.  They thought we could
		do business.

	LUCA listens.

				SOLLOZZO
		I need somebody strong to protect
		my operation, physically.  I've
		heard you're not happy with your
		family, you might make a switch.

				LUCA
		If the money is good enough.

				SOLLOZZO
		On the first shipment, I can
		guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

	LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

	SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
	rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
	BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
	magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then,
	he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
	puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

	INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.  He approaches
	it, obviously fresh from a nap.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you recognize my voice?

				SONNY
		I think so.  Detective squad?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Right.  Don't say my name, just
		listen.  Somebody shot your father
		outside his place fifteen minutes
		ago.

				SONNY
		Is he alive?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I think so, but I can't get close
		enough.  There's a lot of blood.
		I'll try to find out more.

				SONNY
		Find out anything you can...you got
		a Grand coming.
			  (click)


	SONNY cradles the phone.  An incredible rage builds up in
	him, his face actually turning red.  He would like to rip
	the phone to pieces in his bare hands.  Then he controls it.
	Quickly, he dials another number.

				SONNY
		Theresa, let me talk to Tom.  Not
		yet?  Have him call me as soon as
		he gets home.

	He hangs up.

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, who is it?
			  (she enters the room)
		What is it?

				SONNY
			  (calmly)
		They shot the old man.

				SANDRA
		Oh God...

				SONNY
		Honey...don't worry.  Nothing else
		is going to happen.

	There is a POUNDING on the door.  A BABY starts crying.

				SANDRA
			  (really frightened)
		SONNY?

	SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and
	moves quickly.  He opens the front door quickly.  It is
	CLEMENZA.  He enters, SONNY closes the door.  SANDRA goes to
	look after the baby.

				CLEMENZA
			  (excited)
		You heard about your father?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		The word is out in the streets that
		he's dead.

				SONNY
		Where the hell was Paulie, why
		wasn't he with the Don?

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie's been a little sick all
		winter...he was home.

				SONNY
		How many times did he stay home the
		last couple of months?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe three, four times.  I always
		asked Freddie if he wanted another
		bodyguard, but he said no.  Things
		have been so smooth the last ten
		years...

				SONNY
		Go get Paulie, I don't care how
		sick he is.  Pick him up yourself,
		and bring him to my father's house.

				CLEMENZA
		That's all?  Don't you want me to
		send some people over here?

				SONNY
		No, just you and Paulie.

	CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the
	couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

				SONNY
		A couple of our people will come to
		stay here.  Do whatever they say;
		I'm going over to the main house.
		If you want me, use Pop's special
		phone.

	The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it.

				SONNY
		Hello.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		Santino Corleone?

	SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY
	indicates that she be quiet.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		We have Tom Hagen.  In about three
		hours he'll be released with our
		proposition.  Don't do anything
		until you've heard what he has to
		say.  You can only cause a lot of
		trouble.  What's done is done.
			  (a pause)
		Don't lose that famous temper of
		yours.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		I'll wait.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the
	courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the
	tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure
	of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

	INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls
	out.

				SONNY
		Ma?  Ma, where are you.

	The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes
	her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm.

				SONNY
		Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's
		hurt...I don't know how bad.

				MAMA
			  (quietly)
		Santino?  Have they killed him?

				SONNY
			  (almost in tears)
		We don't know yet, Ma.

				MAMA
		I'll get dressed.  In case we can
		see him...

	She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY
	turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He
	takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,
	and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his
	father's office.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	He switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive
	desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the
	telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,
	and dials a number.

				SONNY
		Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
		I want fifty reliable men out here.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		I heard, Sonny...but what about
		Clemenza's regime?

				SONNY
		I don't want to use Clemenza's
		people right now.  Understood?

	He hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the
	dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the
	desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
	We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA
	BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer.

				SONNY
		Luca.

	INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

	The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits
	and ties sit around in the booths.

	HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

				SOLLOZZO
		I know you're not in the muscle end
		of the family--so I don't want you
		to be afraid.  I want you to help
		the Corleones and I want you to
		help me.

	HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette
	in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye
	to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered
	china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully.

				SOLLOZZO
		Your boss is dead...

	HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
	SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (pushing the bottle)
		Have some more.  We got him outside
		his office, just before I picked
		you up.  You have to make the peace
		between me and Santino.

	HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

				SOLLOZZO
		Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
		You know it's the smart thing to
		do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny
		into it.

				HAGEN
			  (pulling himself together)
		Sonny will come after you with
		everything he's got.

	SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

				SOLLOZZO
		That's going to be his first
		reaction.  You have to talk some
		sense into him.  The Tattaglia
		family stands behind me with all
		their people.  The other New York
		Families will go along with anything
		that prevents a full scale war.

	He leans close to HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Don was slipping; in the old
		days I could never have gotten to
		him.  Now he's dead, nothing can
		bring him back.  Talk to Sonny,
		talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza
		and Tessio...it's good business.

				HAGEN
		Even Sonny won't be able to call
		off Luca Brasi.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'll worry about Luca.  You take
		care of Sonny and the other two kids.

				HAGEN
		I'll try...It's what the Don would
		want us to do.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (lifting his hands in
			  an expression of harmlessness)
		Good...then you can go...
			  (he escorts him to
			  the door)
		I don't like violence.  I'm a
		businessman, and blood is a big
		expense.

	He opens the door; they step out together.

	EXT NITE: BUILDING

	HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

	But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
	He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to
	SOLLOZZO in private.

	Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the
	door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

				SOLLOZZO
		The old man is still alive.  Five
		bullets in his Sicilian hide and
		he's still alive.
			  (he gives a fatalistic
			  shrug)
		Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL driving during the night.  There is a little fog in
	the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making
	it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view,
	as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
	decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white
	floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The
	narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
	chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving
	cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
	chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

				MAN
		Who're you?

	ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and
	then turns.

				MAN 2
		It's the Don's kid; take the car,
		I'll bring him inside.

	The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

	INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

	The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL
	doesn't recognize.  They pay little attention to him.  Most
	of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas
	tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

	THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a
	cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water
	glass half filled with whiskey.  On the other side of the
	sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is
	sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black
	with his saliva.  PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the
	other side of the room.  CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Your mother's at the hospital with
		the old man: He's gonna pull through.

	MICHAEL nods his relief.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

	He moves to THERESA.

				MICHAEL
			  (gently)
		You heard from Tom yet?

	Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and
	trembles.  Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the
	room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

				MICHAEL
			  (taking her hand)
		C'mon.

	He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.  They look
	up, startled.

				SONNY
		Don't worry, Theresa; they just
		want to give Tom the proposition,
		then they're going to turn him loose.

	He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,
	he kisses him on the cheek.

				SONNY
		I was worried when we couldn't get
		in touch with you in that hick town.

				MICHAEL
		How's Mom?

				SONNY
		Good.  She's been through it before.
		Me too.  You were too young to know
		about it.  You better wait outside;
		there're some things you shouldn't
		hear.

				MICHAEL
		I can help you out...

				SONNY
		Oh no you can't, the old man'd be
		sore as hell if I let you get mixed
		up in this.

				MICHAEL
		Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

				SONNY
		Theresa.

	She understands, and leaves them alone.

				SONNY
		All right, Mikey...who do we have
		to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

				MICHAEL
		What?

				SONNY
		One of them fingered the old man.

	MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on
	trial for their lives.

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.

				SONNY
		You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
		It was Paulie.

				MICHAEL
		How can you be sure?

				SONNY
		On the three days Paulie was sick
		this month, he got calls from a
		payphone across from the old man's
		building.  We got people in the
		phone company.
			  (he shrugs)
		Thank God it was Paulie...we'll
		need Clemenza bad.

	MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the
	situation.

				MICHAEL
		Is it going to be all-out war, like
		last time?

				SONNY
		Until the old man tells me different.

				MICHAEL
		Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't
		care what it costs.  I don't care
		if we have to fight all the five
		families in New York.  The Tattaglia
		family's going to eat dirt.  I
		don't care if we all go down
		together.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		That's not how Pop would have
		played it.

				SONNY
		I know I'm not the man he was.  But
		I'll tell you this and he'll tell
		you too.  When it comes to real
		action, I can operate as good as
		anybody short range.

				MICHAEL
			  (calmly)
		All right, Sonny.  All right.

				SONNY
		Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

				MICHAEL
		Is it like they say?  Is he that
		good?

	Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
	Then open the door and rush out.

	Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped
	in a tight embrace with his WIFE.

				HAGEN
		If I plead before the Supreme
		Court, I'll never do better than I
		did tonight with that Turk.

	EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's
	study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on
	the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,
	in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the
	morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many
	snacks.  They can barely talk anymore.

				HAGEN
		Is the hospital covered?

				SONNY
		The cops have it locked in and I
		got my people there visiting Pop
		all the time.  What about the hit
		list.

	HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

				HAGEN
		Too much, too far, too personal.
		The Don would consider this all
		purely a business dispute: Get rid
		of Sollozzo, and everything falls
		in line.  YOU don't have to go
		after the Tattaglias.

	CLEMENZA nods.

				HAGEN
		What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't
		seem worried about Luca.  That
		worries me.

				SONNY
		If Luca sold out we're in real
		trouble.

				HAGEN
		Has anyone been able to get in
		touch with him?

				SONNY
		No, and I've been calling all night.
		Maybe he's shacked up.

				HAGEN
		Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
		He always goes home when he's
		through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's
		number.

	MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the
	number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the
	other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up.

				HAGEN
		Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
			  (exhausted)


				SONNY
		Tom, you're the Consigliere, what
		do we do if the old man dies?

				HAGEN
		Without your father's political
		contacts and personal influence,
		the Corleone family loses half its
		strength.  Without your father, the
		other New York families might wind
		up supporting Sollozzo, and the
		Tattaglias just to make sure there
		isn't a long destructive war.  The
		old days are over, this is 1946;
		nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If
		your father dies...make the deal,
		Sonny.

				SONNY
			  (angry)
		That's easy to say; it's not your
		father.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I was as good a son to him as you
		or Mike.

				SONNY
		Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it
		that way.

				HAGEN
		We're all tired...

				SONNY
		OK, we sit tight until the old man
		can give us the lead.  But Tom, I
		want you to stay inside the Mall.
		You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio,
		you hold your people in reserve,
		but have them nosing around the
		city.  The hospital is yours; I
		want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours
		a day.

	There is a timid knock on the door.

				SONNY
		What is it?

	PAULIE GATTO looks in.

				CLEMENZA
		I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

				PAULIE
		The guy at the gate's outside...says
		there's a package...

				SONNY
		Tessio, see what it is.

	TESSIO gets up, leaves.

				PAULIE
		You want me to hang around?

				SONNY
		Yeah.  Hang around.

				PAULIE
		Outside?

				CLEMENZA
		Outside.

				PAULIE
		Sure.

	He closes the door.

				SONNY
		Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie.
		I don't ever want to see him again.
		Understood?

				CLEMENZA
		Understood.

				SONNY
		Okay, now you can move your men
		into the Mall, replace Tessio's
		people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a
		couple of Clemenza's people and go
		to Luca's apartment and wait for
		him to show.  That crazy bastard
		might be going after Sollozzo right
		now if he's heard the news.

				HAGEN
		Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up
		in this so directly.  You know the
		old man doesn't want that.

				SONNY
		OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

	MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca
	Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one
	answers.

	TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest
	in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped
	inside.

				CLEMENZA
		A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi
		sleeps with the fishes.

	INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we
	remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
	LUCA looks up at him.

	Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
	LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
	clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is
	thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His
	face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
	purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
	far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes
	bulge.

	ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's
	strength leaves him.

				BRUNO
			  (making an ugly face)
		Oh Christ...all over the floor.

	SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his
	face.

	LUCA falls to the floor.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Godfather is next.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of
	pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A
	dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
	noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This
	is ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
	talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
	side of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
	specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
	washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.

				LAMPONE
		Nice.

				CLEMENZA
		Crazy Detroit delivered it with a
		wooden bumper.  They're going to
		send me the chrome bumpers in a
		couple months.  I waited two years
		for this car to come with wooden
		bumpers!

	He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

				CLEMENZA
		Today you make your bones on Paulie.
		You understand everything?

				LAMPONE
		Sure.

	As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
	unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

				CLEMENZA
		.22 soft-nosed load.  Accurate up
		to five feet.

	LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into
	the driveway, and he sounds the horn.

	The two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit
	nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in
	the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
	recognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
	to chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little
	when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

				PAULIE
		Rocco, sit on the other side.  A
		big guy like you blocks my rearview
		mirror.

	CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Goddamn Sonny.  He's running scared.
		He's already thinking of going to
		the mattresses.  We have to find a
		place on the West Side.  Paulie,
		you know a good location?

	PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
	he was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling
	Sollozzo any secret location.

				PAULIE
		I'll think about it.

				CLEMENZA
			  (grunting)
		Drive while you thinking; I wanna
		get to the City this month!

	The car pulls out.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

	Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump.  OUR
	VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
	light.

	INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
	He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Pay attention!

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	The car is parked in the City.  PAULIE comes down from an
	available apartment and gets back into the car.

				PAULIE
		Good for ten men...

				CLEMENZA
		OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm
		suppose to call when I found
		somethin'.

	The car pulls off.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
	CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		You wait; I'll call.

	He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
	corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

	INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
	The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
	bread--and then a plate of veal on his table.  He eats.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
	he is well fed.

	We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
	expect has happened to Paulie.

	There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
	LAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.

				CLEMENZA
		He talked my ear off.  Want us to
		go back to Long Beach; have another
		job for us.  Rocco, you live in the
		City, can we drop you off?

				LAMPONE (O.S.)
		Ah, I left my car at your place.

				CLEMENZA
		OK, then you gotta come back.

	The car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
	secure.

				PAULIE
		You think we'll go for that last
		place?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe, or you gotta know now.

				PAULIE
		Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

	The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
	Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a
		leak.

	The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA
	steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

	He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
	see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
	the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there
	are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
	turns, moving back to the car.

	PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
	him are shattered.

				CLEMENZA
		Leave the gun.

	LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
	feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange
	cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group
	of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
	with concealed weapons.

	MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

	He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the
	strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They
	look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
	respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He
	wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

	A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
	equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This
	is where he was a child.  Then a shout.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone.

	CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL
	hurries into the house.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
	He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the
	hook.

				CLEMENZA
		Some dame.

	MICHAEL picks it up.

				MICHAEL
		Hello.  Kay?

				KAY (O.S.)
		How is your father?

				MICHAEL
		He'll be OK.

				KAY (O.S.)
			  (pause)
		I love you.

	He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the
	phone.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I LOVE YOU.

				MICHAEL
		Yeah Kay, I'm here.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Can you say it?

				MICHAEL
		Huh?

				KAY (O.S.)
		Tell me you love me.

	MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls
	up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

				MICHAEL
		I can't...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Please say it.

				MICHAEL
		Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

				KAY (O.S.)
		OK.
			  (click)


	CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all
	the button men stationed around the house.

				CLEMENZA
		How come you don't tell that nice
		girl you love her...here, learn
		something... you may have to feed
		fifty guys some day.  You start
		with olive oil...fry some garlic,
		see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat
		balls if you like...then you throw
		in the tomatoes, the tomato
		paste...some basil; and a little
		red wine...that's my trick.

	SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

				SONNY
		You take care of Paulie?

				CLEMENZA
		You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's
		sick for good this winter.

	MICHAEL starts to leave.

				SONNY
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		To the city.

				SONNY
			  (to Clemenza; dipping
			  bread into the sauce)
		Send some bodyguards.

				MICHAEL
		I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just
		going to see Pop in the hospital.
		Also, I got other things.

				CLEMENZA
		Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

				SONNY
		OK, but be careful.

	EXT NITE: CAR

	MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven
	into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front
	seat.

	INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

	MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying
	to book rooms.

	INT NITE: HOTEL

	MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel.  He is
	preoccupied, she's concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
		I'll just sit with him; I want to
		show respect.

				KAY
		Can I go to the hospital with you?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  You don't want
		to end up on page 3 of the Daily
		News.

				KAY
		My parents don't read the Daily
		News.  All right, if you think I
		shouldn't.  I can't believe the
		things the papers are printing.
		I'm sure most of it's not true.

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so either.
			  (silence)
		I better go.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to go back to New
		Hampshire...think things over.

	He leans over her; kisses her.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		Goodbye.

	Quietly, he moves out the door.

	KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

				KAY
		Goodbye.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
	a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays
	the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

	MICHAEL looks.

	He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He
	is the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling
	Christmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,
	slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He
	hesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the
	address on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the
	door, it is empty.

	He walks in.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
	lobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
	corridor.  To the left: the same.

	HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
	building lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are
	his sole footsteps.

	He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there.
	He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it;
	no one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a
	sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

				MICHAEL
		Hello?  Hello?

	Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
	alertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
	alone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

	Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
	flights.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

	He steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are
	merely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;
	checks it.  "Room 4A."  Now he hurries, trying to follow the
	code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
	and quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A--
	Corleone".

	There is a special card table set up there with some
	magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
	ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

	INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

	Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
	will find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the
	window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
	room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be
	heard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly
	MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
	securely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
	bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a
	NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

				NURSE
		You're not supposed to be here now.

	MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

				MICHAEL
		I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
		father.  What happened to the
		detectives who were guarding him?

				NURSE
		Oh your father just had too many
		visitors.  It interfered with the
		hospital service.  The police came
		and made them all leave just ten
		minutes ago.
			  (comfortingly)
		But don't worry.  I look in on him.

				MICHAEL
		You just stand here one minute...

	Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

				MICHAEL
		Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
		down at the hospital.  I came down
		late.  There's no one here.  None
		of Tessio's people--no detectives,
		no one.  The old man is completely
		unprotected.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		All right, get him in a different
		room; lock the door from the inside.
		I'll have some men there inside of
		fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and
		don't panic.

				MICHAEL
			  (furiously, but kept inside)
		I won't panic.

	He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

				NURSE
		You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You and I are going to move my
		father right now...to another room
		on another floor...Can you
		disconnect those tubes so we can
		wheel the bed out?

				NURSE
		Absolutely not!  We have to get
		permission from the Doctor.

				MICHAEL
		You've read about my father in the
		papers.  You've seen that no one's
		here to guard him.  Now I've just
		gotten word that men are coming to
		this hospital to kill him.  Believe
		me and help me.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		We don't have to disconnect them,
		we can wheel the stand with the bed.

	She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
	moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
	down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
	MICHAEL hears them, stops.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry, into there.

	They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks
	out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they
	emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
	of flowers.

				MICHAEL
			  (stepping out)
		Who is it?

				ENZO
		Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,
		the baker's helper to Nazorine, now
		his son-in-law.

				MICHAEL
		Enzo, get out of here.  There's
		going to be trouble.

	A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

				ENZO
		If there...will be trouble...I stay
		with you, to help.  I owe it to the
		Godfather.

	MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

				MICHAEL
		Go outside; stand in front...I'll
		be out in a minute.

	INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	They part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they
	put his FATHER.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		He's awake.

	MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
	cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

				MICHAEL
		Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,
		don't try to speak.  There are men
		who are coming to try to kill you.
		But I'm with you...I'm with you
		now...

	The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly
	puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

	Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
	pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
	weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They
	both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
	They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
	lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of those and look like
		you've got a gun in your pocket.

	The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
	decorations.

				MICHAEL
		Listen...

	We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL
	and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes
	the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
	They stand, hands in their pockets.

	A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
	MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car
	seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
	MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the
	BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they
	are not.

	Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
	police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
	getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

	In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
	the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
	POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts
	toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
	arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
	spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
	with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is
	McCLUSKEY.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I thought I got all you guinea
		hoods locked up.  Who the hell are
		you and what are you doing here?

	ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

				COP
		He's clean, Captain.

	MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		What happened to the detectives who
		were supposed to be guarding my
		father?

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		You punk-hood.  Who the hell are
		you to tell me my business.  I
		pulled them off.  I don't care how
		many Dago gangsters kill each other.
		I wouldn't lift a finger to keep
		your old man from getting knocked
		off.  Now get the hell out of here;
		get off this street you punk, and
		stay away from this hospital.

	MICHAEL stands quiet.

				MICHAEL
		I'll stay until you put guards
		around my father's room.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Phil, lock this punk up.

				A DETECTIVE
		The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a
		war hero, and he's never been mixed
		up in the rackets...

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put
		the cuffs on him.

				MICHAEL
			  (deliberately, right
			  to McCLUSKEY's face,
			  as he's being handcuffed)
		How much is the Turk paying you to
		set my father up, Captain?

	Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
	squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
	MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at
	McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
	he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
	MEN arrive.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a
	long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN
	stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
	rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
	standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is
	escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
	MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He
	stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN
	holding rifles.

				MICHAEL
		Christ, Sonny really means business.

	They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various
	BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

				CLEMENZA
		How come all the new men?

				TESSIO
		We'll need them now.  After the
		hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
		We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
		this morning.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

	They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

				SONNY
		I've got a hundred button men on
		the streets twenty-four hours a day.
		If Sollozzo shows one hair on his
		ass he's dead.

	He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
	kiddingly.

				SONNY
		Mikey, you look beautiful!

				MICHAEL
		Cut it out.

				SONNY
		The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve
		of that son of a bitch!  After he
		craps out last night he wants a meet.

				HAGEN
		Was there a definite proposal?

				SONNY
		Sure, he wants us to send Mike to
		meet him to hear his proposition.
		The promise is the deal will be so
		good we can't refuse.

				HAGEN
		What about that Tattaglias?  What
		will they do about Bruno?

				SONNY
		Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out
		what they did to my father.

				HAGEN
		We should hear what they have to say.

				SONNY
		No, no Consiglere.  Not this time.
		No more meetings, no more
		discussions, no more Sollozzo
		tricks.  Give them one message: I
		WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all
		out war.  We go to the mattresses
		and we put all the button men out
		on the street.

				HAGEN
		The other families won't sit still
		for all out war.

				SONNY
		Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

				HAGEN
		Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
		want to hear this.  This is not a
		personal thing, this is Business.

				SONNY
		And when they shot me father...

				HAGEN
		Yes, even the shooting of your
		father was business, not personal...

				SONNY
		No no, no more advice on how to
		patch it up Tom.  You just help me
		win.  Understood?

	HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

				HAGEN
		I found out about this Captain
		McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
		He's definitely on Sollozzo's
		payroll, and for big money.
		McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
		bodyguard.  What you have to
		understand is that while Sollozzo
		is guarded like this, he's
		invulnerable.  Nobody has ever
		gunned down a New York Police
		Captain.  Never.  It would be
		disastrous.  All the five families
		would come after you Sonny; the
		Corleone family would be outcasts;
		even the old man's political
		protection would run for cover.  So
		just...take that into consideration.

				SONNY
			  (still fuming)
		McCluskey can't stay with the Turk
		forever.  We'll wait.

				MICHAEL
		We can't wait.  No matter what
		Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
		figuring out how to kill Pop.  You
		have to get Sollozzo now.

				SONNY
		The kid's right.

				HAGEN
		What about McCluskey?

				MICHAEL
		Let's say now that we have to kill
		McCluskey.  We'll clear that up
		through our Newspaper contacts later.

				SONNY
		Go on Mike.

				MICHAEL
		They want me to go to the conference
		with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting
		for two days from now.  Sonny, get
		our informers to find out where the
		meeting will be held.
		Insist it has to be a public place:
		a bar or restaurant at the height
		of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel
		safe.  They'll check me when I meet
		them so I won't be able to carry a
		weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
		way to have one planted there for
		me.
			  (pause)
		Then I'll kill them both.

	Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
	Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points
	a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

				SONNY
		You?  You, the high-class college
		kid.  You never wanted to get mixed
		up in the family business.  Now you
		wanta gun down a police Captain and
		the Turk just because you got
		slapped in the face.  You're taking
		it personal, it's just business and
		he's taking it personal.

	Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
	his face serious.

				MICHAEL
			  (angrily, but cold)
		Sonny, it's all personal, and I
		learned it from him, the old man,
		the Godfather.  He took my joining
		the Marines personal.  I take
		Sollozzo trying to kill my father
		personal, and you know I'll kill
		them Sonny.

	MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

	INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE on a revolver.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		It's as cold as they come,
		impossible to trace.
			  (he turns it upside down)
		Don't worry about prints Mike, I
		put a special tape on the trigger
		and butt.  Here.
			  (he hands the gun to
			  another pair of hands)
		Whatsamatter?  Trigger too tight.
			  (it fires: very LOUD)
		I left it noisy, so it'll scare any
		pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander
		away.

	MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

				CLEMENZA
		Just let your hand drop to your
		side, and let the gun slip out.
		Everybody will still think you got
		it.  They'll be starin' at your
		face, see?  Then walk out of the
		place real fast, but don't run.
		Don't look anybody directly in the
		eye, but don't look away from them
		neither.  Hey, they'll be scared
		stiff o you, believe me.  Nobody's
		gonna bother with you.  Don't worry
		about nothing; you'd be surprised
		how good these things go.  O.K.,
		put your hat on, let's see how you
		look.  Helps with identification.

	They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

				CLEMENZA
		Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse
		to change their identification when
		we make them see the light.  Then
		you take a long vacation and we
		catch the hell.

				MICHAEL
		How bad will it be?

				CLEMENZA
		Probably all the other families
		will line up against us.  But, it's
		alright.  These things have to
		happen once every ten years or
		so...gets rid of the bad blood.
		You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
		Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at
		Munich, they shoulda never let him
		get away with that, they were just
		asking for big trouble...

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card
	table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
	Corleone buttonmen.

	He continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY
	asleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of
	a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
	whisky.  The radio is playing.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you stop living like a
		bum and get this place cleaned up.

				SONNY
		What are you, inspecting the
		barracks?
			  (SONNY sits up with
			  his head in his hands)
		You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you
		be sure to drop the gun right away?

				MICHAEL
		A million times.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to
		pick you up in an hour and a half
		on Times Square, under the big
		Camels sign.

				HAGEN
		We don't let Mike go until we have
		the hostage, Sonny.

				CLEMENZA
		It's okay...the hostage is outside
		playing pinochle with three of my
		men.

	The phone rings in the DON's office.

				SONNY
		That could be a Tattaglia informer
		with the meeting place.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
	move in.

	HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

				SONNY
		One of Tattaglia's people?

				HAGEN
		No.  Our informer in McCluskey's
		precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he
		signed out for Louis' Restaurant in
		the Bronx.  Anyone know it.

				TESSIO
		Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us.
		A small family place with big
		booths where people can talk in
		private.  Good food.  Everybody
		minds their business.  Perfect.
			  (he moves to the desk
			  and makes a crude drawing)
		This is the entrance, Mike.  When
		you finish just walk out and turn
		left, then turn the corner.
		Clemenza, you gotta work fast to
		plant the gun.  They got an old-
		fashioned toilet with a space
		between the water container and the
		wall.  We can tape the gun behind
		there.

				CLEMENZA
		Mike, they're gonna frisk you in
		the car.  You'll be clean so they
		won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the
		restaurant, wait and talk a while,
		and then ask permission to go.  See?
		Then when you come out, don't waste
		time; don't sit down...you come out
		blasting.  And don't take chances.
		In the head, two shots apiece.  And
		out as fast as your legs can move.

				SONNY
		I want somebody very good, very
		safe to plant that gun.  I don't
		want my brother coming out of that
		toilet with just his dick in his
		hand.

				CLEMENZA
		The gun will be there.

				SONNY
			  (to MICHAEL, warmly)
		You're on, kid...I'll square it
		with Mom your not seeing her before
		you left.  And I'll get a message
		to your girl friend when I think
		the time is right.

				CLEMENZA
		We gotta move...

				MICHAEL
		O.K.  How long do you think before
		I can come back?

				SONNY
		Probably a year...

				HAGEN
			  (starting to crack)
		Jesus, I don't know...

				SONNY
		Can you do it Mike?

	MICHAEL moves out.

	EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

	The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
	MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
	CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the
	corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open
	the front door.

				DRIVER
		Get in, Mike.

	He does, the car drives off.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
	and shakes MIKE's hand.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we
		can straighten everything out.  All
		this is terrible, it's not the way
		I wanted things to happen at all.
		It should never have happened.

				MICHAEL
		I want to settle things tonight.  I
		want my father left alone.

				SOLLOZZO
		He won't be; I swear to you be my
		children he won't be.  Just keep an
		open mind when we talk.  I hope
		you're not a hothead like your
		brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to
		talk business with him.

	McCLUSKEY grunts.

				MCCLUSKEY
		He's a good kid.  He's all right.
		Turn around, up on your knees,
		facing me.

	He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I'm sorry about the other night
		Mike.  I'm getting too old for my
		job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the
		aggravation.  You know how it is.
		He's clean.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
	they're heading.

	The car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		We're going to New Jersey?

				SOLLOZZO
			  (sly)
		Maybe.

	MICHAEL closes his eyes.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

	The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
	to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider,
	temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
	lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on
	the way back to the city.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
	then leans to the DRIVER.

				SOLLOZZO
		Nice work; I'll remember it.

	MICHAEL is relieved.

	EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
	the Bronx:  The "LUNA AZURA".  There is no one on the street.
	MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
	them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
	and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
	car.  They enter the restaurant.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
	SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
	round table near the center of the room.  There are empty
	booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
	and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Is the Italian food good here?

				SOLLOZZO
		Try the veal; it's the finest in
		New York.

	The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
	They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
	glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

				SOLLOZZO
		I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll
		concentrate on my veal and my
		spaghetti.

	SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening
	carefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers
	in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally
	brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
	Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
	Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

				MICHAEL
			  (using English for emphasis)
		Most important...I want a sure
		guarantee that no more attempts
		will be made on my father's life.

				SOLLOZZO
		What guarantees can I give you?  I
		am the hunted one.  I've missed my
		chance.  You think too highly of
		me, my friend...I am not so
		clever...all I want if a truce...

	MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
	holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up
	my sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
	on his face.

				SOLLOZZO
		What is it?

				MICHAEL
		Is it all right if I go to the
		bathroom?

	SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with
	his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
	thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I frisked him; I've frisked
		thousands of young punks; he's clean.

	He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
	indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,
	indicating no one is there.

				SOLLOZZO
		Don't take too long.

	MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
	disappears inside.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
	hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his
	hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
	Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
	Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
	cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is
	just a few inches from the gun...he gropes
	searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

	CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he
	breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
	breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some
	unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
	washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
	McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO
	turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
	MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues
	back to the table.  He sits down.

				MICHAEL
		Now I can talk.  I feel much better.

	The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
	he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
	comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
	his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
	but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
	him.

	The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
	speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
	from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
	the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
	temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
	head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
	entire area.

	The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
	sprayed and stained with blood.

	SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
	seems to hang in space suspended.

	MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

	There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
	suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

	MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
	throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then
	coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
	through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

	The air is filled with pink mist.
	MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
	He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
	Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
	The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
	expression of horror on his face.
	MICHAEL looks at his two victims:
	SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
	the table.
	McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
	MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His
	hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
	He moves, not letting the gun go.

	MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

	His hand: still holding the gun.

	His face: finally he closes his eyes.

	His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

	He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

	He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
	been recreated in wax.

	Then he leaves.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old
	upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
	ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

	A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,
	quietly eating.  They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there
	is an occasional laugh.

	ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered
	with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

	A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

	The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

	INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie
	still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

	INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS

	Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty
	living room of an apartment.  THREE or FOUR MEN including
	CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

	An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

	The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and
	pouring the wine.

	Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

	INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an
	office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
	Truman.

	EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

	ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning
	three steps of a front stoop.

	INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a
	crossword puzzle.

	A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

	Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
	Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

	A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of
	Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

	EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

	A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet
	alley.

	INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in
	a pool of blood on the tablecloth.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an
	apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family
	War..."

	The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE
	has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

	SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

	The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up
	and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods
	appreciatively.

				MAN
		Nice Augie...nice.

	EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

	Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
	apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's
	bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
	against the curb.

	Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
	brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

	Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,
	smoking a cigarette.

	One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,
	which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a
	door opening; they look up.

	The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

	SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
	wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she
	draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
	comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

	He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
	on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The
	men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:

				DRIVER
		Pick up your sister?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

	The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
	bodyguards in their cars.

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

	He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again.

				CONNIE'S VOICE
		Who is it?

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY
	enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
	back to him.

				SONNY
			  (tenderly)
		Connie, what is it?

	He turns her around in his arms.

	Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
	rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
	As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
	with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
	him from running out of the apartment.

				CONNIE
			  (desperately)
		It was my fault!  I started a fight
		with him and I tried to hit him so
		he hit me.  He didn't even try to
		hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

	Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder,
	the thin silk robe.

				SONNY
		I'm goin' to have the doctor come
		over and take a look at you.

	He starts to leave.

				CONNIE
		Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
		Please don't.

	He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

				SONNY
		Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do?
		Make your kid a orphan before he's
		born.

	She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

	EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

	CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
	"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
	beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
	corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
	kids on the street are still playing stickball.

	CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
	suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
	and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires
	scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
	MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
	the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we
	recognize that it is SONNY.

	His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
	the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

	He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
	into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
	and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
	hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
	His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

	SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

	SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
	in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His
	blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

	The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
	in fascination.

	CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

	SONNY beats him mercilessly.

	Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
	spectators.

	SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
	CARLO's face and body.

	CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
	nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

	SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
	him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
	the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
	even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.

	It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
	not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
	more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he
	stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

				SONNY
		You...bastard...You...hurt my
		sister... again...and I'll
		kill...you.

	He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
	and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
	leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN
	with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
	interested.

	CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps
	onto the stoop.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day.
	Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
	various points around the main house and compound.  Things
	have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
	and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures
	that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
	a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
	Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
	result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the
	crater is damaged by fire.

	A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
	yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
	shelter of the gate house.

	They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
	call the main house.

	KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
	runs down onto her face.

	She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
	sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

	TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

				HAGEN
		Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You
		should call...

				KAY
		I've tried calling and writing.  I
		want to reach Michael.

				HAGEN
		Nobody knows where he is.  We know
		he's all right, but that's all.

	KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
	rainwater.

				KAY
		What was that?

				HAGEN
		An accident.  No one was hurt.

				KAY
		Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
		come in to call another one?

	TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
	to.

				HAGEN
		Sure...I'm sorry.

	They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
	takes her rainhat off.

				KAY
		Will you give this to him.

				HAGEN
		If I accept that letter and you
		told a Court of Law I accepted it,
		they would interpret it as my
		having knowledge of his whereabouts.
		Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

	We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
	enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

				MAMA
		You're Mikey's little girl.

	KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

				MAMA
		You eat anything?

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
			  (to HAGEN)
		Disgrazia, you don't even give the
		poor girl a cup of coffee?

	HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
	toward MAMA, the letter extended.

				KAY
		Will you give this letter to Michael.

				HAGEN
		Mama, no.

				MAMA
		You tell me what to do?  Even he
		don't tell me what to do.

	She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

				KAY
		Why did they blame Michael?

				MAMA
		You listen to me, you go home to
		your family, and you find a good
		young man and get married.  Forget
		about Mikey; he's no good for you,
		anymore.

	She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
	that means.

	EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

	A hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance
	with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
	hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
	ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
	the DON.

	TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
	up the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
	moment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly,
	siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
	cars.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	The Corleone Mall.

	Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
	Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES.

	It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
	All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday
	clothes, wait.

	EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

	One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,
	preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a
	team of BUTTON MEN.

	Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with
	a rifle on his lap.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

	Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

	Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully
	under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and
	various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

	All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,
	THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
	been converted into a hospital room, with complete and
	extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to
	kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
	SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
	should leave.

	They do, the door is closed.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the
	Sunday dinner, and set the table.

	CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

				CONNIE
		What's the matter, Carlo?

				CARLO
		Shut up.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
	grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON
	does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
	glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is
	the spokesman for the family.

				HAGEN
		...since McCluskey's killing, the
		police have cracked down on most of
		our operations...on the other
		families too.  There's been a lot
		of bad blood.

	The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

				SONNY
		Pop, they hit us and we hit them
		back.

				HAGEN
		We put out a lot of material
		through our contacts in the
		Newspapers...about McCluskey's
		being tied up with Sollozzo in the
		Drug Rackets...things are starting
		to loosen up.

	The OLD MAN nods.

				SONNY
		Freddie's gonna go to Las
		Vegas...under the protection of Don
		Francesco of L.A.  I want him to
		rest...

				FREDO
		I'm goin' to learn the casino
		business.

	The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room
	for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

				HAGEN
		Michael...
			  (he takes a breath)
		It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

	The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
	rage.

				HAGEN
		He's safe now...we're already
		working on ways to bring him back.

	The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
	leave him alone.

	INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
	expansive and optimistic.

				SONNY
		We'll let the old man take it easy
		for a couple of weeks.  I want to
		get things going good before he
		gets better.  What's the matter
		with you?

				HAGEN
		You start operating, the five
		families will start their raids
		again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny,
		your war is costing us a lot of
		money.

				SONNY
		No more stalemate Tom, we got the
		soldiers, we'll match them gun for
		gun if that's how they want it.
		They know me for what I am, Tom--
		and they're scared of me.

				HAGEN
		Yes.  That's true, you're getting a
		hell of a reputation.

				SONNY
		Well it's war!  We might not be in
		this shape if we had a real war-
		time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop
		had Genco, who do I have?
			  (TOM starts to leave)
		Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday,
		we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be
		sore.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table
	over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed
	Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally
	by the gate.

	ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A
	young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

	-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

	CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone.
	We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

				CONNIE
		Who is this?

				GIRL (O.S.)
			  (giggle)
		I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just
		wanted to tell him I can't see him
		tonight; I have to go out of town.

	CONNIE's face turns red.

				CONNIE
		You lousy tramp bitch.
			  (click)


	She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
	bathroom drying his golden body.

				CARLO
		What was that?

				CONNIE
		Your girl friend.  She says she
		can't make it tonight.  You lousy
		bastard you have the nerve to give
		your whores my telephone number.
		I'll kill you, you bastard!

	She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
	she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
	belly heaving under the thin slip.

				CARLO
			  (defending himself)
		You're crazy.  She was kidding
		around; I don't know, some nut.

	He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue
	dressing.

				CONNIE
		You're staying home.  You're not
		going out.

				CARLO
		OK, OK.  You gonna make me something
		to eat at least?

	That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
	heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
	starts her wifely duties.

	CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
	the doorway.

				CONNIE
		The food is on the table.

				CARLO
		I'm not hungry yet.

				CONNIE
		Eat it, it's on the table.

				CARLO
		Ba Fa Goulle.

				CONNIE
		BA FA GOULE YOU!

	She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment
	later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO
	slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
	smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
	veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

				CARLO
		You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
		Clean it up or I'll kick your head
		in.

				CONNIE
		Like hell I will.

	She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.  Slowly,
	he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
	his hand.

				CARLO
		Clean it up!

	He swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back
	into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
	ready.

				CARLO
		Even the female Corleones are
		murderers.

	He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She
	makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He
	pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She
	gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
	gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

	She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

				CONNIE
		The baby!  The baby!

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM  (SPRING 1946)

	She runs into the bedroom; he follows.  She moves into a
	corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide
	under the bed.

	He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

	He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
	throws her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her
	thigh, pinching it very hard.

				CARLO
		You're fat as a pig.

	Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving
	her in tears.  She is crying; she pulls herself to the
	bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

				CONNIE
		Mama...mama, it's Connie.  Mama, I
		can't talk any louder.  No, I don't
		want to talk to Sonny.

	We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

	In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the
	whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

				SONNY
		Yeah Connie.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Sonny, just send a car to bring me
		home.  I'll tell you then, it's
		nothing Sonny, don't you come.
		Send TOM, please Sonny, it's
		nothing; I just want to come home.

	SONNY's face is turning red.

				SONNY
			  (in a controlled voice)
		You wait there.  You just wait there.

	He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

	HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he
	cannot interfere.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	SONNY leaves the house.  HAGEN moves to the outside mall
	just as SONNY's car is driving off.  He moves to a group of
	BUTTON MEN.

				HAGEN
		Go after him.

	EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
	After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is
	trailing.

	SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY in his car; driving back.  Still breathing hard and
	still furious.  Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
	He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a
	toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
	COLLECTOR.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

	The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

	BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
	BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

				BONASERA
		Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		You owe the Don a service.  In one
		hour, not before, perhaps later, he
		will be at your funeral parlor to
		ask for your help.  Be there to
		greet him.  If you have any
		objections speak now, and I'll
		inform him.

	Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

				BONASERA
		Anything...Anything the Godfather
		wishes.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Good.  He never doubted you.

				BONASERA
		The Don himself is coming to me
		tonight?

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Yes.
			  (click)


	BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
	sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

	Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows
	something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
	from him.  He lights a cigarette.

				BONASERA
		For the last year, they have been
		killing one another.  So now, what?
		Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
			  (whispering, slyly)
		They've killed someone so important
		that they wish to make his body
		disappear.

				MRS. BONASERA
			  (frightened)
		Amerigo!

				BONASERA
		They could make me an accomplice to
		their murder.  They could send me
		to jail!

	He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to
	tie his tie, as she has done for years.

				BONASERA
		And if the other families find
		out...they will make me their enemy.
		They could come here to our house.
		I curse the day I ever went to the
		Godfather.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
	turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
	past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that
	lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into
	the alley.

	He sits on a bench, and waits.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

	The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;
	we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
	parlor.

	CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
	BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO
	OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
	CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
	protruding.

	BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
	the MEN should carry their sinister burden.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming
	room.

	Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
	darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE.

	He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His
	cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
	Then, after a long gaze:

				DON CORLEONE
		Well my friend, are you ready to do
		me this service?

	BONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
	table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

				BONASERA
		What do you wish me to do?

				DON CORLEONE
			  (staring at the table)
		I want you to use all your powers,
		all your skill, as you love me.  I
		do not want his mother to see him
		as he is.

	He draws down the gray blanket.

	BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

	The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

	A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the
	booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets
	him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
	booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
	car blocking him.

	The windows of his car are shot out.

	Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

	His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

	His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it
	continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that
	he will survive it.

	Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and
	actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER
	fire.

	His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

	A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and
	make off in the distance.

	SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they
	are too late.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.  He is silent
	a moment, and then:

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		OK.  Go to Clemenza's house and
		tell him to come here right away.
		He'll tell you what to do.

	The MEN leave him alone.  He is quiet, standing in the
	middle of the living room a moment.  He looks in the
	direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
	moving around.

	INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

	TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
	DON's room.  He opens the DON's door.  Looks in.

	INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON in his hospital bed.  Asleep under sedation.  HAGEN
	hesitates.  He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.  He
	closes the door.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at
	the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he
	hears footsteps.

	The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
	slowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed
	armchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into
	HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Give me a drop of anisette.

	HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

				DON CORLEONE
		My wife was weeping before she fell
		asleep, outside my window I saw my
		caporegimes to the house, and it is
		midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine,
		I think you should tell your Don
		what everyone knows.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was
		about to come up and wake you and
		tell you.  Just now.

				DON CORLEONE
		But you needed a drink first.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now you've had your drink.

	Pause.

				HAGEN
		They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
			  (pause)
		He's dead.

	DON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he
	loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
	him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		I want no inquiries made.  No acts
		of vengeance.
			  (pause)
		Consigliere, arrange a meeting with
		the heads of the five
		families...this war stops now.

	He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

				DON CORLEONE
		Call Bonasera...he will do me a
		service.

	And leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

				HAGEN
		This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

				BONASERA (O.S.)
		Yes, I understand I'm listening.

				HAGEN
		You owe the Don a service.  He has
		no doubt that you will repay it.

	EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

	Day in Manhattan.  An impressive Bank Building in the
	financial center of New York.  Many limousines are parked,
	uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

	INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

	CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
	sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
	MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
	settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
	as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

				DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
		I want to thank you all for coming.
		I consider it a service done to me
		personally and I am in the debt of
		each and every one of you.
		Especially those of you who have
		traveled from such distances as
		California, St. Louis, Kansas City;
		and New Orleans...

	The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
	younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
	short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
	table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
	JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
	older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
	CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
	DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
	and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
	early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
	CONNIE's Wedding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Ah well, let's get down to business.
		We are all honorable men here, we
		don't have to give assurances as if
		we were lawyers.
			  (he sits, gazes out
			  at them, and sighs)
		How did things ever go so far?
		Well, no matter.  A lot of
		foolishness has come to pass.  It
		was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

	The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A
	large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
	and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
	the day's trading, and projected above.

	DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia has lost a son; I have
		lost a son.  We are quits.  Let
		there be a peace...
			  (he gestures
			  expressively,
			  submissively, with
			  his hands)
		That is all I want...

				BARZINI
		Don Corleone is too modest.  He had
		the judges and politicians in his
		pocket and he refused to share them.
		His refusal is not the act of a
		friend.  He takes the bread out of
		the mouths of our families.  Times
		have changed, it's not like the old
		days where everyone can go his own
		way.  If Don Corleone had all the
		judges and politicians in New York,
		then he must share them or let
		others use them.  Certainly he can
		present a bill for such services,
		we're not Communists, after all.
		But he has to let us draw water
		from the well.  It's that simple.

				DON CORLEONE
		My friends, I didn't refuse out of
		malice.  You all know me.  When
		have I ever refused an accommodation?
		But why, this time?  Because I
		think this drug business will
		destroy us in the years to come.
		It's not like whiskey or gambling
		or even women which most people
		want and is forbidden them by the
		pezzonovante of the Church and the
		Government.  But drugs?  No.  Even
		policemen, who help us in gambling
		and other things would refuse to
		help us in drugs.  But...I am
		willing to do whatever all of you
		think is necessary.

				DON ZALUCHI
		I don't believe in drugs.  For
		years I paid my people extra so
		they wouldn't do that kind of
		business...$200 a week.  But it
		didn't matter.  Somebody comes to
		them and says, "I have powders, if
		you put up three, four thousand
		dollar investment, we can make
		fifty thousand distributing."  Who
		can resist such a profit?
		There's no way to control it, as a
		business...to keep it respectable.
			  (rapping the table)
		I don't want it near schools!  I
		don't want it sold to children.
		That is an infamita.
			  (thinking)
		In my city I would try to keep the
		traffic in the dark people, the
		colored.  They are the best
		customers, the least troublesome,
		and they are animals anyway.  They
		have no respect for their wives or
		their families or themselves.  Let
		them lose their souls with drugs.
		But something has to be done, we
		can't have everybody running around
		doing just what they please, like a
		bunch of anarchists.

				BARZINI
		Then, are we agreed; the traffic in
		drugs will be permitted, but
		controlled; and Don Corleone agrees
		to give it protection in the East.

	DON CORLEONE nods.

				BARZINI
		That's the whole matter then, we
		have the peace, and let me pay my
		respects to Don Corleone, whom we
		have all known over the years as a
		man of his word.
			  (noticing TATTAGLIA
			  is uneasy)
		Don Philip?

				TATTAGLIA
		I agree to everything here, I'm
		willing to forget my own misfortune.
		But I must hear strict assurance
		from Corleone.  When time goes by
		and his position becomes stronger,
		will he attempt any individual
		vengeance?

	They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
	DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
	else in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.

				DON CORLEONE
		I forego my vengeance for my dead
		son, for the common good.  But I
		have selfish reasons.  My youngest
		son had to flee, accused of
		Sollozzo's murder, and I must now
		make arrangements so that he can
		come home with safety, cleared of
		all those false charges.  That is
		my affair, and I will make those
		arrangements.
			  (with strength)
		But I am a superstitious man...and
		so if some unlucky accident should
		befall my youngest son, if some
		police officer should accidentally
		shoot him, or if he should hang
		himself in his cell, or if my son
		is struck by a bolt of lightning,
		then I will blame some of the
		people here.  That, I could never
		forgive, but...aside from that, let
		me swear by the souls of my
		Grandchildren that I will never be
		the one to break the peace we have
		made.

	EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

	The DON's black limousine.  He sits quietly in the padded
	rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

	It is night.  Lights flash by them every so often.

				HAGEN
		When I meet with Tattaglia's
		people; should I insist that all
		his drug middle-men be clean?

				DON CORLEONE
		Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini
		is a man who will know that without
		being told.

				HAGEN
		You mean Tattaglia.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (shaking his head)
		Barzini.

				HAGEN
			  (a revelation)
		He was the one behind Sollozzo?

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could
		never have outfought Santino.  But
		I wasn't sure until this day.  No,
		it was Barzini all along.

	The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

	------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

	A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
	downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left
	grotesque and misshapen.

	GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
	jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

	THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
	either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
	shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
	honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
	and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry
	knapsacks.

	The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
	overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

	EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

	The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
	their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn
	sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
	An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The
	car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods
	respectfully.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Michael, why must you do this.  We
		have been lucky so far, all these
		months you've been here we've kept
		your name a secret.  It is from
		love for your father that I've
		asked you never to more than an
		hour from the Villa.

				MICHAEL
		Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
		nothing will happen.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		You must understand that your
		Father's enemies have friends in
		Palermo.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		Corleone.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		There is nothing there.  Not anymore.

				MICHAEL
		I was told that my Grandfather was
		murdered on its main street; and
		his murderers came to kill my
		father there when he was twelve
		years old.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Long ago.  Now there is nothing:
		the men killed each other in family
		vendettas...the others escaped to
		America.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino...I should see this
		place.

	DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		That is your birthright...but
		Michael, use this car.

				MICHAEL
		No...I would like to walk to
		Corleone.

	The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Be careful Michael, don't let them
		know your name.

	The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
	on his journey.

	EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

	The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
	trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

	EXT DAY: VILLAGE

	They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
	post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
	empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
	gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there
	are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

	The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
	road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

	EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

	They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
	a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

	EXT DAY: FIELD

	Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
	of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
	marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
	carrying billowing red banners.

	EXT DAY: GROVE

	They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
	is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

	The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
	loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

	MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

				FABRIZZIO
		You tell us about America.

				MICHAEL
		How do you know I come from America?

				FABRIZZIO
		We hear.  We were told you were a
		Pezzonovanta...big shot.

				MICHAEL
		Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

				FABRIZZIO
		Hey America!  Is she as rich as
		they say?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				FABRIZZIO
		Take me to America!  You need a
		good lupara in America?
			  (pats his shotgun)
		You take me, I'll be the best man
		you got.  "Oh say, can you
		seeee...By da star early light..."

	MICHAEL laughs.

	EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

	The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
	convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
	the U.S. drivers, as they move by.

				FABRIZZIO
		America.
		Hey America!
		Take me with you!
		Hey, take me to America G.I.!

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

	They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
	they hesitate, and look down.

				CALO
		Corleone.

	They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

	MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
	the village.  They walk behind him, and spread to either
	side about fifteen feet away from him.

	They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
	MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
	They go on.

	They move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the
	doorways that they pass.

	MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

	CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

				CALO
		The names of the dead.

	MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.

	The street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman
	will pass.

	MICHAEL turns his head.

	The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

	A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
	street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

	A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead
	is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
	discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of
	young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
	dressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,
	purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
	blossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

	MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
	Fantasy-like scene.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (calling out to them)
		Hey, beautiful girls!

				MICHAEL
			  (sternly)
		Shhhhh.

	He settles down to watch.

	The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
	cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but
	developed and womanly.

	They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
	aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
	Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
	playfully, in the direction of the grove.

	The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
	left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
	them back at her pursuers laughing.

	They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she
	poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
	view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about
	to run.

	MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.

	Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
	and a rich mouth.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (murmuring)
		Jesus Christ, take my soul.  I'm
		dying.

	Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

	MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold
	on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
	laughing.  Then he turns to them.

				FABRIZZIO
		You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

	CALO pats him on the shoulder.

				CALO
		Easy man.

				MICHAEL
		What are you talking about?

				FABRIZZIO
		You can't hide it when you're hit
		by the thunderbolt.

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

	The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
	is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

	MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
	square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

	The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
	he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
	their table.

				FABRIZZIO
		You know all the girls in this
		town, eh?  We saw some beauties
		coming down the road.  One in
		particular got our friend hit with
		the Thunderbolt...
			  (he indicates MICHAEL)

	VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
	new interest.

				VITELLI
		You had better bring a few bottles
		home with you, my friend; you'll
		need help sleeping tonight.
			  (he laughs)

				FABRIZZIO
		This one could seduce the devil.  A
		body! and eyes as big and black as
		olives.

				VITELLI
			  (laughing with
			  them...pouring more wine)
		I know about what you mean!

				FABRIZZIO
		This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?

				VITELLI
			  (laughing)
		Beautiful all over, eh?

				FABRIZZIO
		And hair.  Black and curly, like a
		doll.  And such a mouth.

	VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

				VITELLI
		Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
		but virtuous.

	VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

				MICHAEL
		She wore a red dress, and a red
		ribbon in her hair.  She looks more
		Greek than Italian.  Do you know a
		beauty like that?

	As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
	until he wears a scowl.

				VITELLI
		No.

	Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

				FABRIZZIO
		God in Heaven, I think I
		understand...

	He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he
	returns.

				FABRIZZIO
		Let's get out of here; he's boiling
		up his blood to do us mischief.
		It's his daughter.

	They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

				CALO
		Come quickly.

				MICHAEL
		Innkeeper.  More wine!

				FABRIZZIO
			  (whispered)
		The old bastard mentioned two sons
		he only has to whistle up.

	MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

				MICHAEL
		Tell him to come to me.

	The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
	a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
	between them.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		I understand I've offended you by
		talking about your daughter.  I
		offer you my apologies, I'm a
		stranger in this country, I don't
		know the customs very well.  Let me
		say this, I meant no disrespect to
		you or her...

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

				VITELLI
			  (shrugs)
		Who are you and what do you want
		from my daughter?

				MICHAEL
		I am an American hiding in Sicily
		from the police of my country.  My
		name is Michael.  You can inform
		the police and make your fortune
		but then your daughter would lose a
		father rather than gain a husband.
		In any case, I want to meet your
		daughter.  With your permission and
		under the supervision of your
		family.  With all decorum.  With
		all respect.  I am an honorable man.

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
	asks:

				VITELLI
		Are you a friend of the friends?

				MICHAEL
		When the proper time comes, I'll
		tell you everything that a wife's
		father should know.

				FABRIZZIO
		It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

				VITELLI
			  (formally)
		Come Sunday morning:  My name is
		Vitelli and my house is up there on
		the hill, above the village.

				MICHAEL
		Your daughter's name?

				VITELLI
		Appolonia.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
	Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
	Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
	best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
	luparas on their shoulders.

	DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
	rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

	The Sunday churchbells ring.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

	MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by
	the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
	MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
	Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
	Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to
	APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
	her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light
	at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

	She looks at him.

				APPOLONIA
		Grazia.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

	Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's
	cafe.

	MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,
	though they are all dressed differently.

	They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
	talking and talking.

	MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
	She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

	MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
	seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

	As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
	half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
	further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
	their shoulders.

	Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
	and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains
	her balance, and they continue walking.

	Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

	Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and
	dissonant, plays.

	There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
	the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
	hundred years ago.

	Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
	flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
	confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
	countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

	We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
	all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
	Sicily.

	APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
	despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

	CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
	great wedding celebration.  It is held in the Village
	Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
	tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

	MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
	fills the room.

	He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.  A
	little frightened; but lovely.

	He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
	looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

	Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up
	to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

	She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

	Morning.  MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
	room.

	APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
	covered by the bedsheets.

	He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

	We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
	erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
	hitting th inner court wall.

	APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be
	frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

	Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
	guard duty.

	The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

				MICHAEL
		It's safer to teach you English.

				APPOLONIA
		Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
		Thursday, Friday...See, I learned
		it.  Now teach me to drive!

	DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Ciao, Don Tommassino.

	APPOLONIA kisses him.

				MICHAEL
		Things went badly in Palermo?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		The younger men have no respect.
		Things are changing; I don't know
		what will happen.  Michael, because
		of the wedding, people now know
		your name.

				MICHAEL
		Is that why there are more men on
		the walls?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Even so, I don't think it is safe
		here anymore.  I've made plans to
		move you to a villa near Siracuse.
		You must go right away.

				MICHAEL
		What is it?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Bad news from America.  Your
		brother, Santino.  He has been
		killed.

	For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
	Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	Morning.  MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

	Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
	combing his thick hair.

	MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

				MICHAEL
		Get the car.  I'll be leaving in
		ten minutes.  Where's Calo?

				FABRIZZIO
		Calo is having a cup of coffee in
		the kitchen.  Is your wife coming
		with you?

				MICHAEL
		No, she's going home to her family.
		She'll join me in a few weeks...

	INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

	MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
	kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he
	sees MICHAEL.

				CALO
		Should I get your bag?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?

				CALO
			  (smiling)
		She is sitting in the driver's seat
		of the car, dying to step on the
		gas.  She'll be a real American
		woman before she gets to America.

	MICHAEL smiles.

				MICHAEL
		Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
		the car.

	He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

	He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
	seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

	CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
	seat.

	Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

	Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
	disappear through the gate.

				MICHAEL
			  (muttering to himself)
		Where the hell is he going?

	MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

	MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
	courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

	APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
	where he is.

				APPOLONIA
			  (calling out)
		I'll drive to you.

	He smiles affectionately.

	CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
	by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the
	smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds
	out his hand.

				MICHAEL
		No.  No!

	His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
	as she switched on the ignition.

	Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
	and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

	MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

	INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

	MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear
	whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft
	cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON
	TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and
	from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

				MICHAEL
		Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know
		that the one who gives me Fabrizzio
		will own the finest pastures in
		Sicily.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

	Easter.

	A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes
	of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
	and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
	searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
	Easter eggs.

	The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
	baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
	his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

	Suddenly, he stops and looks.

	MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

	Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
	MICHAEL's direction.

	MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
	and embraces him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Be my son...

	INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

	DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
	building.

				DON CORLEONE
		This old building has seen its day.
		No way to do business...too small,
		too old.

	They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

				DON CORLEONE
		Have you thought about a wife?  A
		family?

				MICHAEL
			  (pained)
		No.

				DON CORLEONE
		I understand, Michael.  But you
		must make a family, you know.

				MICHAEL
		I want children, I want a family.
		But I don't know when.

				DON CORLEONE
		Accept what's happened, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I could accept everything that's
		happened; I could accept it, but
		that I never had a choice.  From
		the time I was born, you had laid
		this all out for me.

				DON CORLEONE
		No, I wanted other things for you.

				MICHAEL
		You wanted me to be your son.

				DON CORLEONE
		Yes, but sons who would be
		professors, scientists,
		musicians...and grandchildren who
		could be, who knows, a Governor, a
		President even, nothing's impossible
		here in America.

				MICHAEL
		Then why have I become a man like
		you?

				DON CORLEONE
		You are like me, we refuse to be
		fools, to be puppets dancing on a
		string pulled by other men.  I
		hoped the time for guns and killing
		and massacres was over.  That was
		my misfortune.  That was your
		misfortune.  I was hunted on the
		streets of Corleone when I was
		twelve years old because of who my
		father was.  I had no choice.

				MICHAEL
		A man has to choose what he will be.
		I believe that.

				DON CORLEONE
		What else do you believe in?

	MICHAEL doesn't answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family.  Can you
		believe in your country?  Those
		Pezzonovante of the State who
		decide what we shall do with our
		lives?  Who declare wars they wish
		us to fight in to protect what they
		own.  Do you put your fate in the
		hands of men whose only talent is
		that they tricked a bloc of people
		to vote for them?  Michael, in five
		years the Corleone family can be
		completely legitimate.  Very
		difficult things have to happen to
		make that possible.  I can't do
		them anymore, but you can, if you
		choose to.

	MICHAEL listens.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family; believe in a
		Code of Honor, older and higher,
		believe in Roots that go back
		thousands of years into your Race.
		Make a family, Michael, and protect
		it.  These are our affairs, sono cosa
		nostra, Governments only protect
		men who have their own individual
		power.  Be one of those men...you
		have the choice.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

	A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		There's a new one.  Construction
		going on everywhere.

	MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the
	bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		That's one of the family's new ones.
		Not bad, eh?

	EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

	The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

	Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,
	NERI, quiet and sinister.

				MICHAEL
		Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
		airport?

				FREDO
		He had business at the hotel, but
		he'll drop in for dinner.

	From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a
	discourtesy.

	INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

	A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of
	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI.  Great fuss is made.  They are
	being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

				FREDO
		You look wonderful, kid; really
		wonderful.  That doctor did some
		job on your face.

				MICHAEL
		You look good, too.

	They enter the suite.

				FREDO
		Nice, eh?

	FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the
	bellboys, waiters and maids.

				FREDO
			  (hurrying into the bedroom)
		Kid, take a look-see.

	MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

	There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,
	mirrors to each side.  FREDO points upward.

	A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

				FREDO
		Ever seen anything like that before?

				MICHAEL
			  (dryly)
		No.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom.  He is just finishing
	dressing; he puts on his jacket.  From the window, with the
	lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night.  MICHAEL
	passes into the other room.

	He stops, looks.  He is disturbed.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;
	a lavish table setting for eight.  Standing by the table are
	HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,
	beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
	NERI stands quietly by the door.

				FREDO
		Mike!  The party starting!

				MICHAEL
		Come here a minute, Fredo.

	FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

				MICHAEL
		Who are those girls?

				FREDO
			  (jokingly)
		That's for you to find out.

				MICHAEL
		Give them some money and send them
		home.

				FREDO
		Mike!

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of them...

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
	MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Corleone family is
		thinking of selling out all our
		interests in the Olive Oil business
		and settling here.  Moe Greene will
		sell us his interest so it can be
		wholly owned by friends of the
		family.

	FREDDIE seems anxious.

				FREDO
		Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
		He never mentioned it to me and he
		loves the business.

				MICHAEL
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Don wants you to help
		us get started.  We figure
		entertainment will be the big
		factor in drawing gamblers.  We
		hope you'll sign a contract to
		appear five times a year for maybe
		a week long engagement.
		We hope your friends in the movies
		will do the same.  We count on you
		to convince them.

				JOHNNY
		Sure, I'll do anything for my
		Godfather.  You know that, Mike.

	There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,
	who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,
	followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed
	in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast
	style.

				MOE
		Mike, good to see you.  Got
		everything you want?

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

				MOE
		The chef cooked for you special;
		the dancers will kick your tongue
		out and you credit is good!
			  (to his BODYGUARDS)
		Draw chips for all these people so
		they can play on the house.

				MICHAEL
		Is my credit good enough to buy you
		out?

	MOE laughs.

				MOE
		Buy me out?...

				MICHAEL
		The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone
		family wants to buy you out.

	GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes
	the BODYGUARDS.

				MOE
			  (furious)
		The Corleone family wants to buy me
		out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy
		me out.

				MICHAEL
		Your casino loses money.  Maybe we
		can do better.

				MOE
		You think I scam?

				MICHAEL
			  (the worst insult)
		You're unlucky.

				MOE
		You goddamn dagos.  I do you a
		favor and take Freddie in when
		you're having a bad time, and then
		you try to push me out.

				MICHAEL
		You took Freddie in because the
		Corleone family bankrolled your
		casino.  You and the Corleone
		family are evened out.  This is for
		business; name your price.

				MOE
		The Corleone family don't have that
		kind of muscle anymore.  The
		Godfather is sick.  You're getting
		chased out of New York by Barzini
		and the other families, and you
		think you can find easier pickings
		here.  I've talked to Barzini; I
		can make a deal with him and keep
		my hotel!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly, deadly)
		Is that why you thought you could
		slap Freddie around in public?

				FREDO
			  (his face turns red)
		Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe
		didn't mean anything.  He flies off
		the handle sometimes; but me and
		him are good friends.  Right, Moe?

				MOE
		Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick
		asses to make this place run right.
		Freddie and I had a little argument
		and I had to straighten him out.

				MICHAEL
		You straightened my brother out?

				MOE
		Hell, he was banging cocktail
		waitresses two at a time.  Players
		couldn't get a drink.

	MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

				MICHAEL
		I have to go back to New York
		tomorrow.  Think of your price.

				MOE
		You son of a bitch, you think you
		can brush me off like that?  I made
		my bones when you were going out
		with cheerleaders.

				FREDO
			  (frightened)
		Tom, you're the Consigliere; you
		can talk to the Don and advise him.

				MICHAEL
		The Don has semi-retired.  I'm
		running the Family business now.
		So anything you have to say, say it
		to me.

	Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
	MOE exits angrily.

				MICHAEL
		Freddie, you're my older brother.
		I love you.  But don't ever take
		sides with anybody against the
		Family again.

	EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

	KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark
	AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

	She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who
	plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

	Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have
	learned to tell are bodyguards.

	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO
	PORTERS carrying luggage.

	NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

	MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

	LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and
	MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically,
	the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;
	and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the
	other cars.

	And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other
	sedans.

	INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

	The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

				MICHAEL
		I have to see my father and his
		people when we get back to the Mall.

				KAY
		Oh Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go to the show tomorrow
		night--we can change the tickets.

				KAY
		Don't you want dinner first?

				MICHAEL
		No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

				KAY
		Wake me up when you come to bed?

	The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding
	limousine window.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The limousine arrives at the Mall.  We are inside.

				KAY
		Your sister wants to ask you
		something.

				MICHAEL
		Let HER ask.

	NERI opens the door.  KAY wants to talk just a little more.

				KAY
		She's afraid to.  Michael...

	MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment
	longer.

				KAY
		Why are you so cold to her and
		Carlo?  They live with us on the
		Mall now, but you never get close
		to them.

				MICHAEL
		I'm busy.

				KAY
		Connie and Carlo want you to be
		godfather to their little boy.

	NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

	He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

				KAY
		Will you?

				MICHAEL
		Let me think about it, O.K.?

	She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY
	and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

	VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.  He
	wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.  He sits in a
	chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Barzini's people chisel my territory
		and we do nothing about it.  Pretty
		soon there won't be one place in
		Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Just be patient.

				TESSIO
		I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
		Just take off the handcuffs.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Be patient.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at
		least recruit our regimes to full
		strength.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No, I don't want to give Barzini an
		excuse to start fighting.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Mike, you're wrong.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

	The OLD MAN looks up.  CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
	Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.  NERI stands by the door;
	HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

				CLEMENZA
		You said there would come a day
		when Tessio and me could form our
		own Families.  Only with your
		benediction, of course.  I ask
		permission...

				DON CORLEONE
		My son is head of the Family now.
		If you have his permission, you
		have my good will.

				MICHAEL
		In six months you can break off
		from the Corleone Family and go on
		your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on
		you to make the move to Nevada;
		you'll be my right-hand man out
		there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the
		Consigliere.

	Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
	He remains inexpressive.

				MICHAEL
		He's going to be our lawyer in
		Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any
		other business as of now, this
		minute.  No reflection on Tom;
		that's the way I want it.  Besides,
		if I ever need any advice, who's a
		better Consigliere than my father.

				CLEMENZA
		Then in a six month time we're on
		our own; is that it?

				MICHAEL
		Maybe less...

				TESSIO
		Let us fill up our Regimes.

				MICHAEL
		No.  I want things very calm for
		another six months.

				TESSIO
		Forgive me, Godfather, let our
		years of friendship be my excuse.
		How can you hope for success there
		without your strength here to back
		you up?  The two  go hand in hand.
		And with you gone from here the
		Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
		too strong for us.

				CLEMENZA
		And I don't like Barzini.  I say
		the Corleone Family has to move
		from strength, not weakness.  We
		should build our Regimes and take
		back our lost territories in Staten
		Island, at least.

				DON CORLEONE
		Do you have faith in my judgement?

				CLEMENZA
		Yes, Godfather...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then do what Michael says...

				MICHAEL
		All I can say is that things are
		being resolved that are more
		effective than a thousand buttonmen
		on the streets.  Understood?

	There are uneasy looks all around.

				CARLO
		Understood.  I just wish I was
		doing more to help out.

				MICHAEL
		I'll come to you when I need you.

	He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod,
	reluctantly.

				MICHAEL
		All right, then it's resolved.

	NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

	CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
	then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
	corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

	Then NERI closes the door.

	MICHAEL relaxes.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why are you cutting me out of
		the action?

				MICHAEL
		Tom, we're going to be legitimate
		all the way, and you're the legal
		man.  What could be more important
		than that.

				HAGEN
		I'm not talking about that.  I'm
		talking about Rocco Lampone building
		a secret regime.  Why does Neri
		report directly to you, rather than
		through me or a caporegime?

				DON CORLEONE
		I told you that it wouldn't escape
		his eye.

				MICHAEL
		How did you find out?

				HAGEN
		Bookkeepers know everything.
		Rocco's men are all a little too
		good for the jobs they're supposed
		to be doing.  They get a little
		more money than the job's worth.
			  (pause)
		Lampone's a good man; he's operating
		perfectly.

				MICHAEL
		Not so perfectly if you noticed.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why am I out?

				MICHAEL
		You're not a wartime Consigliere.
		Things may get tough with the move
		we're trying.

				HAGEN
		OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
		You're going about it all wrong;
		you're making the move out of
		weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
		if he tears you apart, the other
		families won't come running to help
		the Corleones...

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, I never thought you were a bad
		Consigliere, I thought Santino a
		bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a
		good heart but he wasn't the right
		man to head the family when I had
		my misfortune.  Michael has all my
		confidence, as you do.  For reasons
		which you can't know, you must have
		no part in what will happen.

				HAGEN
		Maybe I can help.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You're out, Tom.

	TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM
	leaves.

	MICHAEL looks at NERI.

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to talk to my father.

	NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,
	breathes in the air, and steps outside.

	EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

				DON CORLEONE
		I see you have your Luca Brasi.

				MICHAEL
		I'll need him.

				DON CORLEONE
		There are men in this world who
		demand to be killed.  They argue in
		gambling games; they jump out of
		their cars in a rage if someone so
		much as scratches their fender.
		These people wander through the
		streets calling out "Kill me, kill
		me."  Luca Brasi was like that.
		And since he wasn't scared of
		death, and in fact, looked for
		it...I made him my weapon.  Because
		I was the only person in the world
		that he truly hoped would not kill
		him.  I think you have done the
		same with this man.

	They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,
	peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
	MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then
	stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

				DON CORLEONE
		Barzini will move against you first.

				MICHAEL
		How?

				DON CORLEONE
		He will get in touch with you
		through someone you absolutely
		trust.  That person will arrange a
		meeting, guarantee your safety...

	He rises, and looks at Michael...

				DON CORLEONE
		...and at that meeting you will be
		assassinated.

	The DON walks on further.

				DON CORLEONE
		Your wife and children...you're
		happy with them?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.

	MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

				MICHAEL
		I've always respected you...

	A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

				DON CORLEONE
		And I...you.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
	them off.

				KAY
		How is your husband feeling?

				MAMA
		He's not the same since they shot
		him.  He lets Michael do all the
		work.  He just plays the fool with
		his garden, his peppers, his
		tomatoes, as if he was some peasant
		still.  But men are like that...

	She stops toward the Church.

				MAMA
		You come in, too.

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
		The Priest ain't gonna bite you
		cause you're not Catholic.
			  (whispered)
		He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

	KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
	They enter.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
	the holy water.

				MAMA
		You can.

	Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
	blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
	awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
	the Altar.

	MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a
	large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
	candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
	her some.

	MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
	taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
	dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
	twenty candles.

	She finishes, and bows her head.

	EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

	Very few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black
	flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
	An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
	Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

	Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show
	these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to
	Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The
	Sacred Heart"...

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Silence.

	The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
	all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

	Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
	wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
	somber and respectful.

	MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
	which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of
	Don Corleone.

	BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
	family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
	with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

	The VIEW ALTERS,

	and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
	openly falling, takes his turn.

	Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
	look at the great man.

	CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE
	immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
	Families to pay their respects.

	First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP
	TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

	Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

	MICHAEL watches the scene.

	BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
	by his men.

	As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
	him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
	from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
	he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
	Corleone.

	MICHAEL watches silently.

	BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First
	CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.

	CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He
	embraces and comforts her.

	Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
	all who come close to him.

	EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

	Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
	still hundreds of mourners.

	A young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18.

				GIRL
		Do you remember me?

				TESSIO
		No...

				GIRL
		We danced together at Connie's
		wedding.

	TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
	and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He
	finds him.

				TESSIO
		Mike, could I have a minute?

	MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close
	by.

				TESSIO
		Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
		Says we can straighten any of our
		problems out.

				MICHAEL
		He talked to you?

				TESSIO
			  (nods)
		I can arrange security.

	MICHAEL looks at him.

	EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

	The Cemetery.  Late day.

	The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
	stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
	Queens Village.

	Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
	pictures, etc.

	MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Christ, Tom; I needed more time
		with him.  I really needed him.

				HAGEN
		Did he give you his politicians?

				MICHAEL
		Not all...I needed another four
		months and I would have had them
		all.
			  (he looks at TOM)
		I guess you've figured it all out?

				HAGEN
		How will they come at you?

				MICHAEL
		I know now.
			  (a passion wells up
			  inside of MICHAEL)
		I'll make them call me Don.

				HAGEN
		Have you agreed on a meeting?

				MICHAEL
			  (nods)
		A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn
		on Tessio's ground, where I'll be
		safe.

	HAGEN looks at him; understands.

				MICHAEL
		But after the Baptism.  I've
		decided to stand as godfather to
		Connie's baby.

	They look up.

	The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
	stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
	with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

	ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
	pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we
	see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
	uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
	Then the badge, and the identification card; with his
	picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
	begins to dress.

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
	their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
	beginning to take on a matronly look.

	INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

	In a Long Island motel.

	ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,
	checks it, and puts it back together.

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

	PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates,
	takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
	gets in, drives off.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The Church.

	Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
	Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
	Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

	CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the
	infant; showing him off to interested people.

	EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

	NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN
	Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a
	policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

	LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort
	Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
	"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY".

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.

	CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and
	MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

				PRIEST
			  (to MICHAEL)
		Do you pledge to guide and protect
		this child if he is left fatherless?
		Do you promise to shield him
		against the wickedness of the world?

				MICHAEL
		Yes, I promise.

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

	NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He
	continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On
	his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
	across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he
	approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
	nightstick.

	The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

	NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.

	The DRIVER turns his head away.

				NERI
		OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
		you wanna move?

				DRIVER
			  (obviously a hood)
		You better check with your precinct.

				NERI
		Move it!

	The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
	and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
	jacket.

	NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then
	he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

				NERI
		Let me see you license and
		registration.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

	LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
	It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he
	returns into the room.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He
	rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently
	applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

				PRIEST
		Ephetha...be opened...So you may
		perceive the fragrance of God's
		sweetness.

	EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

	The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center
	is arguing with NERI.

	Now the DRIVER looks up.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
	glass doors.

	NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
	doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
	BARZINI within them.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him
	the infant.

				PRIEST
		Do you renounce Satan.

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce him.

				PRIEST
		And all his works?

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce them.

	INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

	LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
	the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
	PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a
	semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

	They are riddled with gunfire.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with
	his package.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant
	MICHAEL holds.

				PRIEST
		Do you wish to be baptized?

				MICHAEL
		I do wish to be baptized.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

	CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

	He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate
	elevator waiting shaft.

	The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

	The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with
	the dapper MOE GREENE.

	CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

	The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

				PRIEST
		I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

	Flash bulbs go off.  Everyone is smiles, and crowds around
	MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The christening party outside the Church.

	Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
	receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

	Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

	As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out
	and works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This
	is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

	CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

				CONNIE
		Kiss your Godfather.

	The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
	excuse to back away.

				MICHAEL
		Carlo...we've had a change in the
		plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the
		kids will have to take the trip out
		to Vegas without us.

				CONNIE
		Oh Mike, it's our first vacation
		together.

				CARLO
			  (anxious to please)
		Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

				MICHAEL
		Go back to your house and wait for
		me...

	He kisses KAY.

				MICHAEL
			  (to KAY)
		I'll just be a couple of days...

	People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to
	drive off.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

	TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

	HAGEN enters.

				HAGEN
		You'd better make your call to
		Barzini; Michael's ready.

	TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

				TESSIO
		We're on our way to Brooklyn.

	He hangs up and smiles.

				TESSIO
		I hope Mike can get us a good deal
		tonight.

				HAGEN
			  (gravely)
		I'm sure he will.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.  On their
	way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

				BUTTON MAN
		The boss says he'll come in a
		separate car.  He says for you two
		to go on ahead.

				TESSIO
			  (frowning)
		Hell, he can't do that.  It screws
		up all my arrangements.

	THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

				HAGEN
			  (gently)
		I can't go with you either, Tessio.

	He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
	panics, and then he accepts it.

				TESSIO
			  (after the pause)
		Tell Mike it was business...I
		always liked him.

				HAGEN
		He understands that.

	TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

				TESSIO
			  (softly)
		Tom, can you get me off the hook?
		For old times' sake?

				HAGEN
		I can't.

	HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about
	twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

	TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

	HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather
	nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
	LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

	They move toward us.

	Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

	He wears a broad smile.

				CARLO
		Godfather!

				MICHAEL
		You have to answer for Santino.

	The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
	attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
	backs into the living room.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	The door opens, and the grim party enters.

				MICHAEL
		You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
		people.  That little farce you
		played out with my sister.  Did
		Barzini kid you that would fool a
		Corleone?

				CARLO
			  (dignity)
		I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on
		the head of my children, I'm
		innocent.  Mike, don't do this to
		me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		Barzini is dead.  So is Philip
		Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
		and Moe Greene...I want to square
		all the family accounts tonight.
		So don't tell me you're innocent;
		admit what you did.

	CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

				MICHAEL
			  (almost kindly)
		Don't be frightened.  Do you think
		I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
		think I'd make your children
		fatherless?  After all, I'm
		Godfather to your son.  No, your
		punishment is that you're out of
		the family business.  I'm putting
		you on a plane to Vegas--and I want
		you to stay there.  I'll send
		Connie an allowance, that's all.
		But don't keep saying you're
		innocent; it insults my intelligence
		and makes me angry.  Who approached
		you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

				CARLO
			  (sees his way out)
		Barzini.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Good, good.  Leave now; there's a
		car waiting to take you to the
		airport.

	CARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting;
	with a group of MEN around it.

	He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

				MICHAEL
		I'll call your wife and tell her
		what flight you're on.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his
	things in the trunk.

	ONE opens the front door for him.

	SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

	CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
	to see the other man.

	It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

	The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
	suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes
	and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

	The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

	His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

	Then the body goes slack.

	CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
	drives off.

	EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

	MICHAEL and his party.  They watch.

	Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

	MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

	They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights
	flash by.

	NERI turns back.

				NERI
		You know I would never question
		anything you say.

				MICHAEL
			  (smiles)
		Speak your mind.

				NERI
		I'll do this for you; you know I
		should.

				MICHAEL
		No.  This I have to do.

	EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

	MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
	Italian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door.

				MICHAEL
		Sit in the car.

	INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

	He walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza
	dough in the air.

				MICHAEL
		Where's the boss?

				MAN
		In the back.  Hey Frank, someone
		wants you.

	A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

				MAN
		What is it?

	He stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO.

	VIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is
	cut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
	these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
	indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

	A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
	the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
	restrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs
	across the Mall into Michael's house.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	Inside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed;
	furniture prepared for shipping.

				CONNIE
		Michael!

	She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
	MICHAEL and KAY.

				KAY
			  (comforting)
		Connie...

	But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI
	is watchful.

				CONNIE
		You lousy bastard; you killed my
		husband...

				KAY
		Connie...

				CONNIE
		You waited until our father died
		and nobody could stop you and you
		killed him, you killed him!  You
		blamed him about Sonny, you always
		did, everybody did.  But you never
		thought about me, never gave a damn
		about me.
			  (crying)
		What am I going to do now, what am
		I going to do.

	TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
	from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
	finish.

				KAY
		Connie, how could you say such
		things?

				CONNIE
		Why do you think he kept Carlo on
		the Mall?  All the time he knew he
		was going to kill my husband.  But
		he didn't dare while my father was
		alive.  And then he stood Godfather
		to our child.  That coldhearted
		bastard.
			  (to KAY)
		And do you know how many men he had
		killed with Carlo?  Just read the
		papers.  That's your husband.

	She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
	she has no saliva.

				MICHAEL
		Get her home and get a doctor.

	The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
	gently but firmly.

	KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
	MICHAEL.  He feels her look.

				MICHAEL
		She's hysterical.

	But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

				KAY
		Michael, it's not true.  Please
		tell me.

				MICHAEL
		Don't ask me.

				KAY
		Tell me!

				MICHAEL
		All right, this one time I'll let
		you ask about my affairs, one last
		time.

				KAY
		Is it true?

	She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
	directly that we know he will tell the truth.

				MICHAEL
			  (after a very long pause)
		No.

	KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
	him.  Then she kisses him.

				KAY
			  (through her tears)
		We both need a drink.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

	She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
	drinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
	drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
	house with their BODYGUARDS.

	She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
	them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
	foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a
	Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

	CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

				CLEMENZA
		Don Corleone...

	The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
	husband has become.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY wears a shawl over her hand.  She drops many coins in
	the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
	a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

				    and

			 Francis Ford Coppola




















SECOND DRAFT

September 24, 1973





FADE IN:

The Paramount Pictures logo is presented over a simple black
background, as a single trumpet plays the familiar theme of
a waltz.  White lettering fades in:

		     Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER

There is a pause, as the trumpet concludes, and there is the
additional title: - Part Two -

INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD OFFICE - CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
CORLEONE - DAY

standing impassively, like a young Prince, recently crowned
King.

CLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand.  ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand.
Then it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and
chair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over
this, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance,
as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY

We can barely make out the funeral procession passing over
the burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move
slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.

The MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their
instruments harsh and blaring.

They are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the
crude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a
strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the
arms of those walking with her.

Behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and
paisani continue alone behind the coffin.

Suddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians
stop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd
directions along the rocky river bed.

The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,
throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.
We hear a woman SCREAMING:

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		They've killed young Paolo!  They've
		killed the boy Paolo!

EXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY

across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on
the parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of
the mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and
veils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to
wail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the
mother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his
fresh blood wetting her strong hands.

EXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY

A boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being
pulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is
to become The Godfather.

The VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by
his Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the
ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.

At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,
or lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy
are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He
wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt
sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat
to protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays
a gold watch and chain over his vest.

He sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,
listening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only
son.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		Don Francesco.  You murdered my
		husband, because he would not bend.
		And his oldest son Paolo, because
		he swore revenge.  But Vitone is
		only nine, and dumb-witted.  He
		never speaks.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		I'm not afraid of his words.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		He is weak.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		He will grow strong.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		The child cannot harm you.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		He will be a man, and then he will
		come for revenge.

As she pleads, the Widow moves closer to the Don, until she
has practically thrown herself to her knees before him.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		I beg you, Don Francesco, spare my
		only son.  He is all I have.  In
		the name of the Holy Spirit, I
		swear he will never be a danger to
		you...

Suddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden
a kitchen knife.

				WIDOW
			(continuing)
		But I will kill you myself!
			(she lunges at the
			Mafia chieftain)
		Vitone, go!

The boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then
there is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother
flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the
terrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn
their attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is
quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.

EXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT

Two men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying
lupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a
loud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.  Their
names are MOSCA and STROLLO.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian)
		Our Friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy Vito
		Andolini.
			(he turns and shouts
			in the other direction)
		Our Friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy Vito
		Andolini.

INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

A family quietly eats their dinner.  The father is the local
policeman, as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun,
hanging nearby.

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian, O.S.)
		Our Friend will be hard with any
		family who gives help to Vito
		Andolini.

One of the children looks up, about to speak.  But the
father sternly indicates that nothing must be said.  They go
on with their dinner.

EXT. THE STREETS OF CORLEONE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The men continue walking up and throughout the streets, far
in the distance.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		...misery to any family who harbors
		the boy, Vito...

INT. A BARN - NIGHT

Four little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and
father bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift
him up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load
of firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically
calm little face.

				FATHER
			(Sicilian)
		Vito...We pray for you.

He pulls the fabric over the boy's face.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		...Andolini...

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		Our Friend promises misery to any
		family...

EXT. THE CHURCH PLAZA - NIGHT

The men continue on their night-walk, up to the plaza of the
church.

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian)
		...who harbors the boy Vitone
		Andolini.

The figure of a single man on a mule passes them.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian)
		Let no one give help to the boy
		Vito Andolini...

The man on the mule makes his way out of the village and
disappears into the distance.

We begin to hear, very quietly, the Waltz repeated once again.

EXT. STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY

huddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in Steerage.
He does not say a word.  The Waltz grows louder as the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled
together with all their earthly possessions on their way to
America.

Then, suddenly, the Waltz stops.

THE NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

SILENCE.  We glide past the Statue of Liberty.

VIEW on the IMMIGRANTS standing on shipboard silently;
looking.  Vito is standing with them, his eyes wide.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the statue, then MOVING PAST, on to the
beautiful buildings of Ellis Island.

EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - DAY

A tugboat pulls a barge brimming with immigrants into the
Ellis Island harbor.  Uniformed officials of the Immigration
Service load them up toward the main building.

INT. ELLIS PROCESSING HALL - DAY

The hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in
the great hall.  Various painted lines lead to the steps and
processing rooms above.

There is the babble of many interviews going on
simultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.

Vito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on
it: "Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia."

He stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant
boys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.
Weak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,
derisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles
to his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in
an icy hatred.

INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY

Three or four interviews are crowded into the small room;
they are conducted in English.  From the expression on
Vito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we
realize that he doesn't understand a word of it.

				OFFICIAL
			(English)
		What is your name?

The man waits, impatiently.

				OFFICIAL
		Your name?

Vito doesn't answer.  The Official pulls the tag pinned onto
his coat and copies to down on his form, using a typewriter.

				OFFICIAL
			(speaking as he types)
		Vito...Corleone.  Step up, over
		there.

He hands the form to another official.

CLOSE VIEW on the form.  The name has been entered as Vito
Corleone.

INT. MEDICAL EXAM - DAY

Vito is stripped to the waist, as other immigrants wait.

The DOCTOR is just finishing his examination.  He shakes his
head, and then writes on the medical form.

				DOCTOR
		Can you understand me?

Vito stares blankly.

				DOCTOR
		You understand?  Smallpox.  Smallpox.

He doesn't understand.  The doctor turns to the Immigration
Official.

				DOCTOR
		Quarantine...six months.

UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Officials move a group of immigrant men, including Vito, to
the quarantine section of the Island.

INT. QUARANTINE HALLWAY - DAY

The official stops at each doorway, and reads off a name.

				OFFICIAL
		Salvatore Ormenta.

The man moves into the room, and the group proceeds.

				OFFICIAL
		Vito Corleone.

No one responds.  The guard moves to the boy, reads his new
name tag.  And then, not unkindly:

				GUARD
		That's you.

He opens the door, and Vito enters the room.

EXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

The VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be
the view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands
on his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred
window.

Then he turns, and sits in the corner.  He is silent for a
long time.

Then, in a sweet, pure voice, he sings to himself in Sicilian.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - MOVING CLOSE SHOT - DAY

A nine year old boy, dressed immaculately in white, with a
large white silk bow tied to his shoulder, moving slowly
down the aisle of the church with a group of other children
dressed in white.  He has dark black hair, and his face is
unmistakably similar to young Vito's.  He moves slowly, his
hands clasped around a golden missal.  We HEAR only the pure
voice of Vito in Sicilian, his sad song reaching out from
the past, as ANTHONY CORLEONE, his Grandson, moves on the
way to his First Holy Communion more than fifty years later.

FULL VIEW

The little children move in procession down to the Altar,
where the PRIEST raises the Host, and performs the Communion
Mass in Latin.

				PRIEST
		Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit
		peccata mundi.

MOVING VIEW ON THE PRIEST

and Altar boys, as he moves along the row of kneeling
children, blessing them, and administering their first
Communion.

CLOSE MOVING VIEW

as the innocent faces receive the Host; finally, the Priest
comes to Anthony.

				PRIEST
		Corpus Christi.

				ANTHONY
		Amen.

EXT. LAKE TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe
are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the
First Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Michael Corleone.  A full dance orchestra plays music
of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for
the occasion.  Speedboats roar through the water, pulling
youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are
filled with laughing, swimming guests.  It is Fall of 1958.

MED. VIEW

Anthony, in his Communion suit sits alone at the table,
looking like a lonely young Prince.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Smile, Anthony.  Smile.

He does, and a flash goes off.

				PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
		Now, one with the whole family.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Mr. Corleone can't right now...

KAY CORLEONE enters from the side, leading her four year old
daughter, MARY, and MAMA CORLEONE to pose with Anthony.

				KAY (O.S.)
		...but we'll get one with the ladies.

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		All together now, c'mon, Anthony...
		CHEESE and
			(flash)

				KAY
		Thank you.

She smiles as she leaves the photographer, and then lets out
a weary sigh to Mama, as she touches the slightly protruding
belly.

				KAY
		Do you think it'll show in the
		picture?

				MAMA
		Two months never shows.  Two months
		look like you had a big lunch.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Oh, Mrs. Corleone.

A slender, aristocratic WOMAN in her late forties is waving
to KAY.

				MRS. BARRETT
		Hello, Mrs. Corleone.  I'm Fran
		Barrett, our place is just down the
		lake.  This is my husband, Marshall.

				KAY
		I'm so happy you could come.

				MR. BARRETT
		The place is transformed.  We've
		been watching workmen come and go
		all summer.

				MRS. BARRETT
		Where is Mr. Corleone?

				KAY
		A business meeting ran late...but
		he promised he wouldn't be long.

Kay puts her arm around little Anthony's shoulder.

				KAY
		This is our son Anthony Vito
		Corleone.  Today he made his First
		Holy Communion.

EXT. TAHOE GATE AND KENNELS - DAY

A confusion of cars; arriving and parking.  The squad of
parking attendants are supplemented by a whole team of the
local Police, working as high-class parking valets.

A very beautiful, statuesque woman, though slightly drunk,
DEANNA DUNN, slams the door of a powder blue Mercedes and
hurries barefoot through the great stone gate.

				DEANNA
		I will not shut my mouth, and keep
		your Goddamn hands off of me!

She is followed by a harried, FREDDIE CORLEONE, dressed with
flash in the Hollywood style, and carrying her shoes in his
hands.

				FREDO
		Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for
		a drive.

				DEANNA
		I just had a drive; besides, I want
		to see my brother-in-law Michael.

				FREDO
			(trying to get her to
			put her shoes on)
		Yeah, but I don't want him to see
		you.

Deanna pauses reflectively a moment, allowing Fredo to get
her shoes on.

				DEANNA
		What beats me, is how you guys
		could be brothers.  You musta been
		your Mother's rotten egg.

She kicks off the shoes, giggling, and runs toward a waiter.

				DEANNA
			(lifting a glass of champagne)
		Young man, young man...thank you,
		young man.

				WAITER
			(impressed)
		Excuse me, but aren't you...

				DEANNA
		Yes, you saw me in the movies, Good
		Humor man, and yes, I had more off
		than my shoes!

				FREDO
		Goddamn bitch.

				DEANNA
		Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance
		with me.

She extends her hand to him.

				FREDO
		Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice
		people here.  Friends of Kay's.
		He'll never forgive me if you ruin
		his party.

				DEANNA
		I hate to see you cringe in front
		of him.  How come you're so scared
		of your own kid brother?

				FREDO
		He's the head of the family.

Disgusted, she turns around, and heads toward the music.

				DEANNA
		Don't follow me!

EXT. TAHOE LAWN AND TABLES - MED. SHOT - DAY

Rushing through the tables, waving an arm jangling with gold
jewelry, and carrying several gift-wrapped packages, is a
hardened and aging CONNIE CORLEONE.  She is followed by a
blond, and wrinkled-handsome escort named MERLE.

				CONNIE
		Mama...Mama!  Here I am!

She throws her arms around her Mother, who returns the
affection somewhat reproachfully.

				MAMA
		Constanzia.  We expected you last
		week; we sent the car to pick you
		up at the airport last week.

				CONNIE
		I know, it was chaos; but anyway,
		here I am one week late.
			(lifting a shiny
			green package out of
			Merle's arms)
		This is for my Mama.  You remember
		Merle?

				MAMA
			(not giving him a
			chance to greet her)
		Yes, thank you.

				CONNIE
		How are the kids?

				MAMA
		Well, thank you, they asked for you
		all week.

				CONNIE
		I got surprises for everybody!

				MAMA
			(glancing at the wrapping)
		Bought at the airport.

				CONNIE
			(gazing about)
		This is swell.  Where's Michael?
		I've got things to get straight
		with him and I can't wait on line.

				MAMA
		You go see your children first, and
		then you wait to see your brother
		like everybody else.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A porch-like foyer of the boathouse, where a group of five
or six men wait, some nervously.  Some sit, and some pace.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on one of these men, FRANKIE PENTANGELI, approaching his
sixties, with gray hair (the little of it left).  He's a bit
scruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not
perfect, and he seems tired.  He is accompanied by an
associate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also
dressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the
attention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man
in white sports jacket and black bow-tie.

				PENTANGELI
		Hey, kid!  You got any red wine?

				WAITER
			(offering the tray)
		Only champagne and cocktails.

				PENTANGELI
		Forget it...

Finally, he sees someone he recognizes, Fredo, and shouts
out in a husky voice:

				PENTANGELI
		Fredo!  Sonuvabitch.  You look great.

Fredo squints in his direction; finally recognizes him.

				FREDO
		Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie
		"Five-Angels"...thought you were
		never coming West.

				PENTANGELI
			(affectionately)
		Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey,
		what's with the food?  Some kid in
		a white jacket brings me a ritz
		cracker with some chopped liver.
		'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a
		peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker
		with chopped liver.' Go get me a
		salami sandwich and a glass of wine
		or I'll send you and your white
		jacket to the dry cleaners!

They get a good laugh at this fresh breath of New York.

				FREDO
		Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you.
		Reminds me of old times.

				PENTANGELI
		You remember Willy Cicci, don't
		you, Freddie?  We was all together
		with the old man Clemenza in
		Brooklyn... before...uh...

				FREDO
		We were all upset about that.

				PENTANGELI
		That's what I'm here to talk to
		your brother about.  What's with
		him, I got to get a letter of
		introduction to have a 'sitdown'?

				FREDO
			(throwing his arm
			around him)
		C'mon, I see what I can do.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - MED. VIEW - DAY

The orchestra wears white summer sportcoats and black tuxedo
slacks as they play a tango behind monogrammed music stands.
A professional dance team, probably imported from Vegas,
dance the tango for the excited guests.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake.  It is
dominated by an enormous bar, behind which stands ALBERT
NERI, discreetly in the background.

MICHAEL CORLEONE sits on a large sofa, his back to us.
Standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy TOM
HAGEN.  Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's
widow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE,
and a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.

				SANDRA
		Michael, this is Gardner Shaw.
		Francesca and he have been seeing
		each other for six months now.
		Gardner, this is Francie's Uncle
		Michael.

				GARDNER
			(a little nervous)
		I've heard a lot about you, Mr.
		Corleone.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Sit down.  Francie.

The couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite Michael.

				SANDRA
		They would like to set an engagement
		date, and...

				MICHAEL
		Let them speak for themselves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL, calm, thoughtful.  One can tell that he has
special affection for his niece.

				FRANCESCA
		We love each other, Uncle Michael.
		And, we want to be married.  I came
		to ask for your blessing.

There is a loud KNOCKING on the door; then Fredo's voice.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		Hey, Mike...guess who's here?

Neri goes to answer it, cracks the door open.

				NERI
		Not now, Freddie...

				FREDO
		Tell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels' is
		here.

				NERI
		Not now...

Neri closes the door, and Michael looks at the nervous young
man.

				MICHAEL
		Francesca is my oldest brother's
		daughter.  He died many years ago,
		and ever since I've felt much more
		of a father than an uncle.  I love
		her very much.  I'm pleased and
		impressed that you had the thought
		to come to me before going on with
		your plans.  It shows me that
		you're a considerate man, and will
		be good to her.  What are you
		studying in college?

				GARDNER
		My major is Fine Arts, sir.

				MICHAEL
		How will Fine Arts support your new
		wife?

				GARDNER
		It's embarrassing to say, sir, but
		I'm a major stockholder in the
		family corporation.

				MICHAEL
			(smiling)
		Never be embarrassed by your wealth.
		This recent contempt for money is
		still another trick of the rich to
		keep the poor without it.
			(warmly)
		Of course I give you my blessing.
		Let's set the wedding soon...it
		will be my pleasure to give the
		bride away.

They all smile, and rise.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...and take a few courses in
		Business Administration just to be
		on the safe side!

They laugh; Michael moves toward them.  Francesca throws her
arms around him, and kisses her favorite uncle.  The flushed
young man shakes his hand heartily.

				FRANCESCA
		Thank you, Uncle Michael.

They all take their leave; Michael turns to Hagen.

				MICHAEL
		Make her dowry impressive.  He
		comes from a family who still
		thinks an Italian bride goes
		barefoot.

EXT. TAHOE SWIMMING POOLS AND HARBOR - DAY

Francesca and Gardner are greeted by her twin sister and
their young friends, who squeal and embrace at the good news.
Someone throws someone in the pool, and life is good.

MED. CLOSE

Francesca kisses her Aunt Kay.

				FRANCESCA
		Uncle Michael is the greatest man
		ever!

VIEW on Kay - happy for her niece.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael sits in the darkened boathouse.  Tom Hagen paces.
Michael is looking at photographs.  Neri stands over him.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

studying the pictures.

				NERI (O.S.)
		His name is Fred Vincent.  He owns
		a small pizza parlor in Buffalo...

CLOSE ON THE PICTURES

Snapshots of a middle-aged man, handsome, Italian.  There is
something familiar about him.

				NERI (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		...American wife and two small kids.
		We traced him and found that he's
		in the country illegally, from
		Sicily...

Michael looks at another picture.  The same man.  Only
younger, and dressed in Sicilian shepherd's clothing.  We
remember him as FABRIZZIO...Michael's traitorous bodyguard
in Sicily.

				NERI (O.S.)
		...came over around 1956.  Sponsored
		by the Barzini Family.

Michael puts the pictures down.

				MICHAEL
		It's him.  Fabrizzio.
			(almost to himself)
		Revenge is a dish that tastes best
		when it's cold.

				NERI
		How do you want me to handle it?

Michael glances at Hagen, who has been waiting in the room.

				MICHAEL
		Later.  Tom?

Hagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through
it:

				HAGEN
		I've cleared it through the
		Senator's chief aide, a man named
		Turnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy
		gambler, and into us for over a
		hundred grand, so I figure his
		information is reliable.

Neri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.

				HAGEN
		The Senator can be set up; but he
		thinks of himself as a clean
		politician.  So it's got to be on
		terms he can live with: campaign
		contribution, donation to a
		charitable cause that he controls,
		things like that.  If he gets even
		the inkling that you think you're
		buying him, he'll freeze up.
		Nevada's a funny state, they like
		things both ways here... All right.
		Turnbull says the Senator will be
		here at two-thirty, and he's been
		primed.  He knows you'll want to
		meet with him alone, and he knows
		it's about the Tropicana's license.
		At any rate, he expects to be
		introduced around to some of the
		influential people here today, and
		generally treated as an ordinary
		guest.  Just go light on him,
		Mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks
		don't like to think of themselves
		as crooks...

Michael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was
unnecessary.

				HAGEN
		I'm sorry; of course, you know that.

				MICHAEL
		Two-thirty.  That gives me time to
		see my boy.

				HAGEN
		Connie's outside.

Michael doesn't want to see her.

				HAGEN
		I promised; she said it was urgent.

Michael nods.

				MICHAEL
		All right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.

Neri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in
impatiently, followed by Merle.

				MICHAEL
		I said I would see my sister, alone.

				MERLE
		I think this concerns me too.
			(taking a cigarette
			from the dispenser)
		You don't, do you?

Connie steps forward, kisses Michael on the cheek.

				CONNIE
		How are you, honey?  You've met
		Merle, haven't you.  He was with me
		in Vegas.

				MICHAEL
		I saw him with you.

				CONNIE
		We're going to Europe next week.  I
		want to get passage booked on the
		Queen.

				MICHAEL
		Why do you come to me?  Why don't
		you go to a travel agent?

				MERLE
		We're going to get married first.

Michael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window
overlooking the lake.

				MICHAEL
		The ink on your divorce isn't dry.
		Your children see you on weekends;
		your oldest boy, Michael Francis...
		was in some trouble with the Reno
		police over some petty theft that
		you don't even know about.

				CONNIE
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		You fly around the world with lazy
		young men who don't have any love
		for you, and use you like a whore.

				CONNIE
		You're not my father!

				MICHAEL
		Then why do you come to me?

				CONNIE
		Because I need MONEY!

				MICHAEL
			(softly)
		Connie, I want to be reasonable
		with you.  You have a house here,
		with us.  You can live here with
		your kids...and you won't be
		deprived of anything.  I don't know
		much about Merle; I don't know what
		he does for a living; what he lives
		on.  Why don't you tell him marriage
		is really out of the question; and
		that you can't see him any more.
		He'll understand.  But if you
		disobey me, and marry this pimp...it
		would disappoint me.

				CONNIE
		It was my father's money; and I'm
		entitled to what I need.  Where is
		Tom Hagen?

She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face
with Merle.

				MICHAEL
		Are you finished?

				MERLE
		I think so.

				MICHAEL
		Then out.

Merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY

The orchestra has struck up a "Paul Jones," where two
concentric circles of young people march in opposite
directions, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever
is opposite them as their new dance partner.

VIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA

Francesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young
friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the
water skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path
leading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small
covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men
step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and
follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his
business.

CLOSE VIEW

Pentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having
some difficulty with the orchestra.

				PENTANGELI
		I can't believe that out of thirty
		professional musicians, not one of
		you is Italian!
			(as the musicians laugh)
		C'mon, give us a tarantella.

He waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano
starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet
starts to play "Pop Goes the Weasel," and soon the rest of
the orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for
approval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a
handful of canapes.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Rocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold
and wet of his boatride, to Michael.

The man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that
Neri should get him a drink.

				MICHAEL
		Rocco, his friends must be hungry.
		See what you can do, but I'd like
		to keep them away from the guests.

The older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his
bodyguards, and they follow Lampone.

				MICHAEL
		You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.
		Johnny Ola.

				OLA
		Sure, I remember Tom from the old
		days.

Tom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his
importance.

				MICHAEL
		Tom isn't going to sit in with us,
		Johnny.  He only handles specific
		areas of the family business.  Tom?

				HAGEN
		Sure, Mikey.

He gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain
silent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear
Tom doesn't want to be excluded.

				HAGEN
		If you need anything, just...

				MICHAEL
		Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.

Hagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes:

				OLA
		I just left our friend in Miami.

				MICHAEL
		How is his health?

				OLA
		Not good.

				MICHAEL
		Is there anything I can do; anything
		I can send?

				OLA
		He appreciates your concern,
		Michael, and your respect.

There's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco
quietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the
conversation.

				OLA
		The hotel's registered owners are
		one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney
		Barclay, both Beverly Hills
		attorneys.  In reality it's split
		between the Old Lakeville Road
		Group from Cleveland, and our
		friend in Miami.  He takes care of
		others outside the country, you
		know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman
		runs the store, and does all right,
		but I've been instructed to tell
		you, that if you move him out, our
		friend in Miami will go along with
		you.

				MICHAEL
		He's very kind, tell him it's
		appreciated.  I'm sure it will be
		profitable all the way around.

				OLA
		He always makes money for his
		partners.  One by one, our old
		friends are gone.  Death, natural
		or not, prison, deported.  Our
		friend in Miami is the only one
		left, because he always made money
		for his partners.

The door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white
Communion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later,
Kay appears, and takes the boy's hand.

				KAY
		Anthony, Daddy's busy.

				MICHAEL
			(rising)
		This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.
		John Ola of Miami.

				KAY
		I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator
		Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.
		Barrett wanted to thank you before
		they left.  Won't you join us, Mr.
		Ola?

				MICHAEL
		Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.
		Please tell the Senator I won't be
		a minute.

Pause; she stands there a moment.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		Kay.

				KAY
		Yes, Michael.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Kay closes the door.  It seems as though Michael has violated
some sort of promise to her by having this man here today.
She looks up toward the first boathouse.

WHAT SHE SEES:

The covered launch, and Ola's three bodyguards, eating while
they wait.

MED. VIEW

Anthony runs away from her, heading toward the house.

				KAY
		Anthony!
			(she runs after him)
		Anthony, where are you going?

Moodily, the boy stops, turns, and walks back to his table
of honor without answering her.

EXT. TAHOE TABLES AND PAVILION - VIEW ON THE PAVILION - DAY

The orchestra has taken its break; now two couples in formal
dress are performing the Quartet from Rigoletto.

VIEW ON HAGEN

sitting by himself, a little down, having a drink.  He's
waiting for Michael to re-summon him.  SANDRA, Sonny's
widow, sits opposite him.

				HAGEN
		Where's my wife?

				SANDRA
		With Mama, putting the baby to
		sleep.  Francesca's very happy.
		Michael was kind to her.  She
		idolizes him.
			(pause; she looks at
			a despondent Hagen)
		The children are all out in the
		speedboat.  I'm going to my house.

Sandra gets up, still an attractive woman, and walks alone
to the back path that leads to her home on the estate.

VIEW ON THE PAVILION

The returned orchestra strikes a big, show-biz chord,
intended to command the guests' attention.

The orchestra LEADER raises his hands for silence, and makes
an announcement over the P.A. system.

				MAESTRO
		Ladies and gentlemen, a most
		distinguished guest would like to
		say a few words: Senator and Mrs.
		Pat Geary of the state of Nevada!

A big hand, as the smiling SENATOR introduces his WIFE by
holding her arm up to the crowd, and then proceeds alone to
the bandstand.

MED. VIEW

Michael stands with Kay and Mrs. Geary.  The Senator's
presence seems to be a statement of political and social
status.

A little distance away, his beautiful son Anthony sits
quietly, in an unmistakably morose mood.

INT. TAHOE - SANDRA'S HOUSE - DAY

We HEAR the applause and whistles echoing in the distance.
Sandra stands in her bedroom, looking at the door.  We SEE a
photograph of SONNY, and also one of their wedding.

A moment goes by, and then Tom Hagen enters, closing the
door behind him.

We begin to HEAR Senator Geary's amplified voice resounding
over the lake.  Hagen moves to Sandra.  She takes him in her
arms, comforting, holding his head against her full breast.

				HAGEN
			(quietly)
		He doesn't want my help any more.
		He doesn't need it.

				SANDRA
		We don't know that's true, he never
		said that.

				HAGEN
		I can feel it in the way he talks
		to me.

He moves to the dresser; pours himself a drink.

				HAGEN
		Just now when Johnny Ola showed up,
		he asked me to leave them alone.
		Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian
		contact.  I was on the inside of
		ten, twenty meetings with him.  But
		today Mike asked me to leave, like
		an outsider.

				SANDRA
		Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.

				HAGEN
		It's as though he blames me for the
		ground the family lost when I was
		Consigliere to Sonny.

Sandra pulls Hagen to her, and kisses him passionately on
the mouth.

				HAGEN
		I love Michael, I want to help him,
		be close to him.  I don't want to
		end up a third string lawyer making
		property settlements for the hotels.

Sandra knows he needs her.  Slowly she begins to undress.

				SANDRA
		We have a little time now.

EXT. THE PAVILION - VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY - DAY

				SENATOR GEARY
		...my thanks, and the thanks of the
		young people of the State of
		Nevada, for this most impressive
		endowment...
			(he holds a check in
			his hand)
		...made to the University in the
		name of Anthony Vito Corleone.
		Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Michael
		Corleone.

Applause.  Senator Geary returns the microphone to the
Maestro who adds:

				MAESTRO
		And now, the Nevada Boys' Choir
		have prepared a special thank you
		for Mr. Michael Corleone.

He turns to a small Choir Master, who leads the Boys' Choir
in a choral arrangement of "MR. WONDERFUL."

VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY

shaking hands with Michael, as Press Photographers snap
pictures, showing the check; showing a special award of
Gratitude from the State; Mrs. Corleone and Mrs. Geary; all
together; Michael and his son; Senator Geary and Michael's
son; and on and on.  In the midst of this:

				SENATOR GEARY
		Where can we meet alone?

Michael indicates the boathouse a distance away, where Neri
seems to be waiting for them.  Then Michael leans to Rocco:

				MICHAEL
		Find Hagen.

Rocco sets off; as more pictures are taken, and the:

BOYS' CHOIR

sings its lovely arrangement of "Mr. Wonderful."

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael, the Senator, Neri and Rocco make a group in the
dark, large room.

				MICHAEL
		It was very kind of you to come to
		my home on this occasion, Senator.
		My wife has been very concerned
		with making a good impression on
		the people who are our neighbors,
		and your appearance here has made
		her very happy.  If I can ever
		perform a service for you, you only
		have to ask.

The door opens, and Hagen sheepishly makes his way in.

				MICHAEL
		My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged
		this all through your man Turnbull.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I thought we would meet alone.

				MICHAEL
		I trust these men with my life.
		They are my right arms; I cannot
		insult them by sending them away.

				SENATOR GEARY
			(taking out some medication)
		Some water.

He addresses that to Neri, who resentfully goes to fetch the
Senator a glass of water.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Alright, Corleone.  I'm going to be
		very frank with you.  Maybe more
		frank than any man in my position
		has ever spoken to you before.

Michael nods, indicating that he should do so.

				SENATOR GEARY
		The Corleone family controls two
		major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno.
		The licenses were grandfathered in,
		so you had no difficulties with the
		Gaming Commission.  But I have the
		idea from sources...
			(takes the water from
			Neri and swallows his pills)
		...that you're planning to move in
		on the Tropicana.  In another week
		or so you'll move Klingman out,
		which leaves you with only one
		technicality.  The license, which
		is now in Klingman's name.

				MICHAEL
		Turnbull is a good man.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Let's forget the bullshit, I don't
		want to stay here any longer than I
		have to.  You can have the license
		for two hundred and fifty thousand
		in cash, plus a monthly fee equal
		to five percent of the gross...

Michael is taken aback; he looks at Hagen.

				SENATOR GEARY
		...of all three Corleone hotels.

Hagen is frustrated; all his information was wrong.

				MICHAEL
		Senator Geary, I speak to you as a
		businessman who has made a large
		investment in your state.  I have
		made that state my home; plan to
		raise my children here.  The
		license fee from the Gambling
		Commission costs one thousand
		dollars; why would I ever consider
		paying more?

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone,
		because I don't like you; I don't
		like the kind of man you are.  I
		despise your masquerade, and the
		dishonest way you pose yourself and
		your fucking family.

VIEW ON HAGEN

glances at Michael.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

makes no outward reaction.

				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		We're all part of the same
		hypocrisy, Senator.  But never
		think it applies to my family.

				SENATOR GEARY
		All right, then let me say you'll
		pay me because it's in your
		interests to pay me.

VIEW ON GEARY

rising.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'll expect your answer, with
		payment, by tomorrow morning.  Only

He is almost out the door.

				MICHAEL
		Senator...
			(cold and calm)
		...you can have my answer now if
		you'd like.

Geary turns back.

				MICHAEL
		My offer is this.  Nothing...not
		even the thousand dollars for the
		Gaming Commission, which I'd
		appreciate if you would put up
		personally.

Geary returns Michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves.
Slowly Michael turns to Hagen.

embarrassed at being so off the mark.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right, Tom, we'll talk
		later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd
		like him to have dinner at my
		family table before we do business.

EXT. THE PAVILION - NIGHT

Now the light has faltered, and the young waiters have put
up the night lights.  The tables are all properly set for
dinner, with candles on each one.

The orchestra is playing quiet, unobtrusive dinner music,
and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the
impressive buffet, under a party tent.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a large table with Kay, his son Anthony,
Mama, Hagen and TERESA, Connie and Merle' Fredo and Deanna,
and Frankie Pentangeli.

				MAMA
		Cent' Anne.

This, the table of honor, all raise their glasses and repeat
the toast.

				DEANNA
		What's 'cent' Anne?'

				FREDO
		A hundred years...it's a toast.

				CONNIE
		It means we should all live happily
		for one hundred years.  The family.
		If my Father were alive, it'd be
		true.

				MAMA
		Connie.

				CONNIE
		Merle, have you met my sister-in-
		law Deanna?

				DEANNA
		What a pleasure, Merle.
			(shaking hands)


				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		Those two are perfect for each other.

				MERLE
		What's that mean?

				CONNIE
		Mama!

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		Michael, in all respect, I didn't
		come three thousand miles for dinner.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know.

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		When do we talk?

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		After dinner.

By now, the conversation has become exclusively Sicilian,
with Merle and Deanna, looking from side to side like in a
tennis match.  Finally, Kay, to be polite:

				KAY
		Anthony, you were talking to Mr.
		Pentangeli?

				ANTHONY
		His name is "Five-Angels."

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian.
		A one-way conversation!

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Pentangeli is angry; but because it is Michael he is talking
to, he keeps his voice low and represses his desire to shout.

				PENTANGELI
		Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart
		attack, but the Rosato Brothers
		gave it to him.

				MICHAEL
		We were all heartbroken at the
		news; but that wasn't cause to
		start a war.

				PENTANGELI
		Okay, now it's my family in
		Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up
		Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how
		can I run my family with you
		challenging my every move?  You're
		too far from the street, Mike, the
		only way to reason with the Rosato
		Brothers is to whack 'em and whack
		'em fast.

				MICHAEL
		You were unfair with them.

				PENTANGELI
		Says who?

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza promised Rosato three
		territories in the Bronx after he
		died, and then you took over and
		welched.

				PENTANGELI
		Clemenza promised them nothing, he
		hated the sonsuvbitches.

				MICHAEL
		They feel cheated.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, you're sitting up here in
		the Sierra Mountains with champagne
		cocktails making judgment on the
		way I run my family.

				MICHAEL
			(suddenly in Sicilian)
		Your family still carries the name
		Corleone, and you will run it like
		a Corleone!

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		And while I feed my family in New
		York, you put the knife in my back
		in Miami.

				MICHAEL
			(firm)
		Frankie, you're a good old man, and
		you've been loyal to my Father for
		years...so I hope you can explain
		what you mean.

				PENTANGELI
		The Rosatos are running crazy;
		taking hostages, spitting in my
		face, because they're backed by the
		Jew in Miami.

				MICHAEL
		I know.  That's why I want you to
		be fair with them.

				PENTANGELI
		How can you be fair with animals?
		They recruit niggers and spicks;
		they do violence in their own
		Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And
		everything is dope and whores; the
		gambling is left to last.  Let me
		run my family without you on my
		back.  I want them taken care of.

				MICHAEL
		No.  There are things that I have
		planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't
		want them disturbed.

				PENTANGELI
		You give your loyalty to a Jew over
		your own blood.

				MICHAEL
		Frankie, you know my father
		respected Roth, did business with
		him.

				PENTANGELI
		He did business...but he never
		trusted him.

Pentangeli takes his hat, and leaves.

				NERI
		Should he go?

				MICHAEL
		The old man had too much vino
		rosso, or he'd never talk openly
		that way.  Let him go back to New
		York; I've already made my plans.
			(he checks his watch)
		It's late; I've spent so little
		time at the party.

EXT. THE LAWNS AND TABLES - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

By now the sun has fallen and the lawns of the Corleone
estate are lit by moonlight.  Beautifully dressed couples
dance as the orchestra plays a foxtrot of the late fifties.

VIEW ON THE DANCE FLOOR

Deanna has been dancing with Fredo; she has gotten drunk and
it teasing her husband by flirting with other men on the
floor.

				DEANNA
		I wanta dance...whatsa matter with
		that?

				FREDO
		Dancing is alright; you're falling
		on the floor.

				DEANNA
		Whatsamatter, you don't want me to

				FREDO
		Deanna, I'm going to belt you right

				DEANNA
		These Eye-ties are really crazy

By now guests are starting to notice the disturbance;
Michael is with Kay, and some friends; Rocco catches his eye.

				DEANNA (O.S.)
		Jesus, never marry a WOP, they
		treat their wives like shit.

VIEW on Kay, listening, embarrassed by her flashy sister-in-
law.

VIEW ON FREDO AND DEANNA

Rocco passes by Fredo and whispers:

				ROCCO
		Freddie, Mike says take care of it,
		or I have to.

				DEANNA
		He's a friend of your brother!

Without another word, Rocco grabs firm hold of her and
whisks her out of the crowd.

				DEANNA
		"Shuffle off to Buffa...
		Shuffle off to Buffa...
		Shuffle off to Buffalooooo..."

Freddie mops his forehead, and moves to Michael.

				FREDO
		Hey Mike, what can I say?

				MICHAEL
		Forget it, just go take care of her.

Kay and Michael dancing in the moonlight.

				MICHAEL
		How's the baby?

				KAY
		Sleeping inside me.

				MICHAEL
		Does it feel like a boy?

				KAY
		Yes, Michael, it does.

				MICHAEL
		I'm sorry about some of the people
		I had to see today.  It was bad
		timing... but it couldn't be helped.

				KAY
		It made me think of what you told
		me once.  In five years, the
		Corleone family will be completely
		legitimate.  That was seven years
		ago.

He has no answer for her; except that he loves and values
her, and holds her tight, as they dance amid their guests,
all dressed elegantly for the social event of the season.

A single organ plays some standard wedding music.

The VIEW PANS up to the altar, where Connie and Merle, in
the same clothing they wore to the Tahoe party, are being

The Justice goes through the bored, simple ceremony, and we

father, when she was married all those years ago in Long
Island.

EXT. THE TROPICANA - LAS VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A dark car pulls up to the glitter of the neon facade.
Albert Neri, alone, leaves it to the parking valets, and
moves quickly through the automatic doors, into the main
casino.  We still hear the CORLEONE WALTZ.

INT. THE TROPICANA - DAY

Albert Neri enters the room; glances around a moment, and
then heads toward the crap table, where a short, middle-aged
man, KLINGMAN, stands by the pit boss.  Several security
guards of the casino, are at their posts.

				NERI
		Are you Klingman?

				KLINGMAN
		Who's asking?

				NERI
		Where can we talk?

				KLINGMAN
		Right here.

				NERI
		I represent the interests of the
		Corleone family.  We make the
		invitation to you to tie up your
		affairs and be out of the hotel by
		Monday morning.

				KLINGMAN
		Who do you think you're talking to?

				NERI
		You said you were Klingman.

				KLINGMAN
		You don't come in here, talk to an
		owner in Las Vegas like that.

				NERI
		You missed my point; you are no
		longer an owner.

				KLINGMAN
		Get out of my hotel.

Neri stands in front of him, smiling.

				KLINGMAN
		Boys, get him out of here.

Quickly, Neri moves toward Klingman, and slaps him hard
several times in the face, knocking off his glasses... Red-
faced, Klingman gets down on his knees to pick them up once,
again.  Glasses on, he looks to his guards.

WHAT HE SEES

They stand, motionless.

Humiliated, Klingman moves across the casino floor, past a

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - 1915 - NIGHT

VITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in
his hand, being led down the crowded aisle of this Italian
Vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled GENCO
ABBANDANDO, his friend in America.  This entire sequence is
played in Sicilian.

				GENCO
		Come on, you've got to see her!

VIEW ON THE STAGE

A tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets
are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance
or exit.

The hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's
left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country,
America.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

All poor, Italo-Americans.  Genco finds a few seats, and
leads Vito to them, stepping on a few shoes in the process.
They have barely come to their seats, when an excited Genco
nudges Vito, and points to the stage.  People shout that
they should sit down.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

There is a knock on the door, and a young girl enters,
delivering a letter to Peppino in his tenement in America.
The girl is pretty; and obviously the object of Genco's
affection.  The letter brings bad news.  Peppino's Mother is
dead.  He weeps, and sings the final song, which most of the
audience knows: SENZA MAMMA.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco is enthralled with the young actress.  The people in
the audience are singing along with Peppino.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

The actress, object of Genco's affection, makes a dramatic
exit.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco pulls on Vito's jacket, indicating that now that his
love is offstage, they should leave.  Vito rises with him,
and they make their way all the way down the aisle.

INT. BACKSTAGE THEATRE - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Genco hurrying down the backstage corridor, hoping to catch
a glimpse of the actress.  He is followed by Vito.  Suddenly,
Genco stops short.

GENCO'S VIEW

A heavy-set, fierce looking Italian wearing an expensive
light-colored suit and a cream colored fedora.  This is
FANUCCI.  He is discussing a business matter with the
theatre IMPRESARIO; a large, strong looking man, who is
sweating nonetheless.  He doesn't seem to be giving in to
Fanucci.  He holds a locked strongbox.

VIEW ON VITO

watching.  The two men argue in Italian.

MED. VIEW

The young ACTRESS crosses into the area, unaware of the
difficulties.  The impresario sees her, and frightened,
motions that she should keep away.

				IMPRESARIO
		Carla!

But Fanucci grabs her easily by her slender wrist, and with
lightning speed, produces a knife which he holds against her
cheek.  The impresario wrings his hands in agony.

				IMPRESARIO
			(Sicilian)
		No...please, not my daughter.

Whereupon he begins to unlock the box which holds the
receipts for the night's box-office.

VIEW ON GENCO AND VITO

hiding, watching.  At first, Genco is enraged, as though he
would rush up to help his enamorata.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The Black Hand.

Then he backs away.  Vito looks at him shocked and
disappointed in this cowardly behavior.  Genco shakes his
head, and points, as though to say that where Fanucci is
concerned, there is nothing to be done.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
			 (whispered)
		Let's get out of here.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

has released the girl.  Her father pulls her away from him,
and slaps her for no reason; then he pays Fanucci.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Because you protested, it will cost
		a hundred more.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

Genco and Vito; Genco leans against the wall, breathlessly,
as though he's had a near escape.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I know what you are thinking,
		Vitone, but you don't understand
		yet how things are.  Fanucci is of
		the Black Hand.  Everyone in the
		neighborhood pays him, even my
		father.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		He's an Italian?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		A pig of a Neaponitan.
			(spits)


				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why?  Why does he bother other
		Italians?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Because he knows them; he knows
		they have no one to protect them.
		Vitone?  What do you think of my
		angel?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Beautiful.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Beautiful.

				VITO
		For you, she is beautiful.  For me,
		there is only my wife!

				GENCO
		I know.  That's why I brought you
		with me!

Genco embraces his good friend, and they laughingly walk
down the alley.

The stage door opens, and Fanucci exits, a sinister figure
in white, moving down the alley just in front of them, into
the night.

The two friends hold their breath, until he disappears.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Vito moves through the street, carrying groceries that he is
to deliver.

It is cold, and so vendors are huddled around fires they
have lit in old cans and drums.

He turns up an alleyway, and then stops.

VIEW UP THE ALLEY

With great strength, Fanucci lifts one of them up into the
air and throws him down hard to the concrete; but another,
holding onto his back, manages to produce a switchblade
knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving
man, slits Fanucci's throat from one side to the other.

Fanucci groans like some great hurt animal.  Blood pours
from the deep, smile-like slit in his throat.

He throws the young man off his back.

VIEW ON VITO

stepping back in the alley.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He takes off his white fedora, and runs down the alley
toward Vito, catching the flowing blood in his hat.

The young attackers scurry off in various directions.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY STORE - DAY

A tiny shop featuring imported food: trays of cured meats,
prosciutto, copagole, mortadella lies on the counter covered
with netting to keep away the thousands of flies.

Olive oil is sold in bulk, as well as wine, cheese and bacala.

Genco works here for his father, and is busy slicing paper
thin prosciutto for a customer, by hand.  Vito works in the
back as a stock clerk.

Finished with his customer, Genco moves to his friend.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I bet you can't guess what happened?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		What?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped
		Fanucci today; slit his throat from
		ear to ear.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers.
		They wanted to scare him, that's
		all.  Make him look bad.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		In Sicily, when you attack a man,
		you had better finish him.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I wish they had.  He takes fifty
		dollars a week from my father's
		cash drawer.  But you can't kill a
		man like Fanucci.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Because he's what we say...
		"connected"... You wait, see what
		happens to those guys from Ninth
		Avenue.

A customer enters; and Genco moves away to serve him.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

recalling what he had seen and thought.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEYWAY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A young man, one of those who had tried to kill Fanucci,
runs down an alleyway, breathlessly.  Then he stops, and
looks behind himself.  Whoever was following him is gone.
He turns and walks ahead.  Then the mammoth, white-suited
figure of Fanucci leaps down before him from the fire-escape.
He grins at the young man, and then raises his neck, showing
the gruesome wound that marks his throat.

He takes out his pistol and fires point-blank at his attacker.

INT. TINY TENEMENT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The very small, railroad type flat where Vito lives with his
new family.

It is late at night, and he is exhausted.

He returns home; where his young wife, CARMELLA, goes
through the silent ritual of preparing a simple meal for him.
He sits and eats quietly.

INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Vito and Carmella enter the darkened bedroom, and approach a
metal crib.  Vito reaches down and takes the small hand of
the baby between his thick peasant fingers.  Carmella waits
a respectful distance behind him.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY - DAY

The shop bell RINGS; SINGER ABBANDANDO turns to see a
smiling Fanucci tipping his hat, like an old customer.

				FANUCCI
		Buon giorno.

Immediately, Vito turns back to his work, and Signor
Abbandando moves to Fanucci with a sigh.

Vito notices the two men talking quietly at one side of the
store, while he goes about his work.  Genco works his way
closer to his friend.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		What did I tell you.  The one who
		cut him was found in an alley.  And
		the family of the others paid
		Fanucci all their savings to make
		him forswear his vengeance.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (surprised)
		And he agreed?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		He took the money.  Now he wants
		double from everybody in the
		neighborhood, including Papa.

Vito watches the heated, but inevitable transaction.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (almost to himself)
		A real mafioso doesn't sell his
		vengeance.

MED. VIEW

Signor Abbandando seems to be arguing with Fanucci, and
every so often they turn and relate to where Vito is working.
Then Fanucci leaves, the little bell RINGING; and Signor
Abbandando reluctantly moves to Vito.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
			(Sicilian)
		Vitone.  How is your son?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		We are all well.

It is clear that he has something difficult to tell the
young man.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
		Vitone...I...Fanucci has a nephew.

Vito looks at him a while, as the old man struggles to tell
him.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		And you must give him my job.

The old man nods, regretfully.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		You have been kind to me since I
		was a boy; taken care of me, and
		been as a father.  I will always be
		grateful to you.  Thank you.

Vito takes off his apron, and leaves, passing the youth who
loiters by the counter.

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

making his way from the store.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO

He turns, and Abbandando has followed him out of the shop,
holding a basket of some groceries.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
		Here...for your family.

				VITO
		No...please understand...I cannot
		accept.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito and his wife sit quietly at the table; the two are
quiet and sad.

Suddenly, we HEAR a noise, and Vito is astonished to see a
young man, PETER CLEMENZA, leaning out of the window on the
other side of the air shaft which separates their apartments.

				CLEMENZA
		Hey Paisan!  Hold this for me until
		I ask for it.  Hurry up!

Automatically Vito reaches over to the empty space at the
air shaft, and takes the bundle of rags.  Clemenza's round
face is strained and urgent, obviously in some kind of
trouble.  Suddenly, he closes the window and there is
activity that we cannot see in the other apartment.

Vito looks to his wife, and then closes the window and
window dressing and takes the bundle into a private part of
his kitchen and begins to unwrap it.

WHAT HE SEES:

Five oily guns.  He immediately wraps them again, and
carries them to a private closet, and hides it, and returns
to his wife.  He sits down back at the table; and she knows
not to ask him what has happened.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Vito is walking through the crowded streets with a group of
workmen; they all wear work clothes, and paper hats on their
heads.

Vito looks to his left, and realizes that Clemenza is
walking silently with him; by contrast, Clemenza dresses well.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (casually)
		Do you have my goods still?

Vito nods.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Did you look inside?

Vito, his face impassive, shakes his head 'no.'

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		I'm not interested in things that
		don't concern me.

INT. DOWNTOWN ITALIAN SOCIAL CLUB - DAY

Vito and Clemenza drinking wine; they've become friends.

				CLEMENZA

		I have a friend who has a fine rug.
		Maybe your wife would like it.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		We have no money for a rug.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		No.  He would give it away.  I know
		how to repay a consideration.

Vito thinks, then nods.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		She would like it.

INT. HALLWAY WEALTHY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The two men proceed up the hallway; Vito is impressed with
the opulence.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Your friend lives in a fine building.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Oh yes, the very best.

Clemenza knocks on the door as though he is well known here;
then rings.  No answer.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Ah, he's not at home.  Oh, well, he
		wouldn't mind.

Quickly and expertly he takes out a tool and pries open the
door.

INT. WEALTHY APARTMENT - FULL VIEW - DAY

Vito looks in awe at the luxurious apartment, which features
a fabulous rich red wool rug.

Clemenza immediately moves some of the furniture away, and
drops to the floor.

				CLEMENZA
		A little help.

Vito joins him, and the two begin rolling the rug.  We HEAR
a BUZZER RING.  Clemenza immediately drops his side of the
roll, and moves to the window.  He pulls a gun from his
jacket.

		my friends.

VIEW ON THE BOY

wide-eyed... he shuts off the press; and takes out a shabby
wooden flute.  And begins to play a simple and pure melody.

CLOSE ON VITO

listening.

CLOSE ON AUGUSTINO

proudly smiling, as he prepares the machine gun.

CLOSE ON TESSIO

listening, smiling.

FULL VIEW

The men listening, as the boy's father prepares their guns.

EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT

Tessio and Clemenza quickly load racks of cheap dresses.

Vito sits behind the wheel of the truck.  He seems reserved,
and we get the impression that he is studying every move his
two friends are making.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Clemenza runs up a flight of stairs with an armful of
dresses.  He knocks on a door, and a pretty HOUSEWIFE answers.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Lady, I got a bargain on these
		dresses.  Five dollars each.  You
		gotta pay at least fifteen, maybe
		twenty in a store.  Look at them,
		first class.

He holds the dresses up and the woman seems interested.  She
handles a couple of them and stands aside so Clemenza can
enter her apartment.

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		I don't know which one I like best.

She holds the dresses against her body, Clemenza approving
of each one; and then she goes to her purse and takes out
five singles and gives them to him.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		You'd look beautiful in all of
		these.  You should buy at least two.

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		Are you kidding?  My husband will
		kill me if he knows I paid five
		dollars for one dress.

She holds one up, then another.  She is torn.  Clemenza
shakes his head and straightens the dress on her body.  His
hand brushes her arm; she looks at him smiling.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		You can have two for five.

She smiles back.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

Clemenza jumps down the stairs, and out to the middle of the
street, where Vito and Tessio are waiting in the car with
some of the stock.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What took so long?

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		She couldn't decide.

Tessio and Clemenza each take more armsful of dresses and
divide the neighborhood.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Vito, take the rest of the stock
		over to Dandine's warehouse; he'll
		move it to a wholesaler.

The three part.  Vito drives the truck off.

MOVING VIEW

Vito drives the truck through the downtown streets; he turns
a corner and stops for a light.

Suddenly, to his left, he sees the formidable figure of
Fanucci.

He grabs young Corleone by the shoulder.

CLOSE VIEW ON FANUCCI

frightening, revealing the large circular scar, now healed.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Ahhh, young fellow.  People tell me
		you're rich, you and your two
		friends.  Yet, you don't show
		enough respect to send a few
		dresses to my home.  You know I
		have three daughters.

Vito says nothing.  Fanucci thumbs through the stock.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		This is my neighborhood.  You and
		your friends have to show me a
		little respect, ah?  This truck you
		hijacked was in my neighborhood.
		You should let me wet my beak a
		little.

Fanucci takes a few of the dresses.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I understand each of you cleared
		around six hundred dollars.  I
		expect two hundred dollars for my
		protection and I'll forget the
		insult.  After all, young people
		don't know the courtesies due a man
		like myself.

Vito smiles at him and nods.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Otherwise the police will come to
		see you and your wife and children
		will be dishonored and destitute.
		Of course, if my information as to
		your gains is incorrect, I'll dip
		my beak just a little.  Just a
		little, but no less than one
		hundred dollars, and don't try to
		deceive me, eh paisan?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		My two friends have my share of the
		money.  I'll have to speak to them
		after we deliver these to the
		wholesaler.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		You tell your friends I expect them
		to let me wet my beak in the same
		manner.  Don't be afraid to tell
		them.  Clemenza and I know each
		other well, he understands these
		things.  Let yourself be guided by
		him.  He has more experience in
		these matters.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (shrugging innocently)
		You must understand, this is all
		new to me...

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I understand...

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		But thank you for speaking to me as
		a Godfather.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
			 (impressed)
		You're a good fellow.

He takes Vito's hands and clasps them in his own.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		You have respect.  A fine thing in
		the young.  Next time, speak to me
		first, eh?  Perhaps I can help you
		make your plans.

Fanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms, waving
to Vito.

Vito throws the truck in gear, and drives off.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

We know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with
an icy rage.

INT. VITO'S APARTMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

He wife serves a dinner for her husband and his two friends.
They discuss Fanucci as they eat.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		Do you think he'd be satisfied with
		the two hundred dollars?  I think
		he would.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		That scar-faced bastard will find
		out what we got from the wholesaler.
		He won't take a dime less than
		three hundred dollars.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What if we don't pay?

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (gestures, it's hopeless)
		You know his friends...real animals.
		And his connections with the police.
		Sure he'd like us to tell him our
		plans so he can set us up for the
		cops and earn their gratitude.
		Then they would owe him a favor;
		that's how he operates.  We'll have
		to pay.  Three hundred, are we
		agreed?

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What can we do?

Clemenza doesn't even bother checking for Vito's opinion.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		They say Fanucci has a license from
		Maranzalla himself to work this
		neighborhood.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		If you like, why not give me fifty
		dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I
		guarantee he will accept that
		amount from me.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		When Fanucci says two hundred he
		means two hundred.  You can't talk
		with him.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I'll reason with him.  Leave
		everything in my hands.  I'll
		settle this problem to your
		satisfaction.

Tessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I never lie to people I've accepted
		as my friends.  Speak to Fanucci
		yourself tomorrow.  Let him ask you
		for the money, but don't pay it,
		and don't in any way quarrel with
		him.  Tell him you have to get the
		money and will send me as your
		messenger.  Let him understand that
		you're willing to pay what he asks,
		don't bargain.  I'll go to his
		house, and quarrel with him.  He
		likes me; enjoys explaining how
		things are here.  He uses ten
		sentences when he only needs one,
		so while he talks, I'll kill him.

Clemenza, irritated, makes a large belch, and washes his
food down with wine.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Vitone!
			(to Tessio)
		Our driver has drunk too much wine.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
			 (laughs at himself)
		He's going to kill Fanucci.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (stern)
		Then, after that, what?  Joe
		'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie
		Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla
		himself, c'mon!

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Fanucci is not connected; he is
		alone.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (sarcastically)
		What?  You read it in the papers?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		This man informs to the police;
		this man allows his vengeance to be
		bought off... No, he is alone.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		If you're wrong...

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		If I'm wrong, they will kill me.

Both Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young
friend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception
of the situation.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church
to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro.
People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of
the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to
the street.

MOVING VIEW

Clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along
the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and
sweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated
gesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a
church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and
slaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;
they embrace.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		All three daughters are at church;
		he is alone.  It's important that
		you let his neighbors see you leave.
		Tessio has broken the latch on the
		skylight of his building.

The wheel stops; they both lose.

				CLEMENZA
			(English)
		See, Brother Carmello, even the
		church makes numbers.

				PRIEST
			(English)
		It's only the way we collect that's
		different.

Vito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.

EXT. FESTA STREET - NIGHT

Vito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and
dark club.

INT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT

We can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa.  Vito
enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure
sitting alone at a small table.  Fanucci barely acknowledges
Vito as he joins him.

Without a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the
table.  Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it
on the table over the money.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I think there's only two hundred
		dollars under my hat.
			(he peeks)
		I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I'm a little short.  I've been out
		of work.  Let me owe you the money
		for a few weeks.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Ah, you're a sharp young fellow.
		How is it I've never noticed you
		before
			(he takes the two
			hundred and pours
			some wine for Vito)
		You're too quiet for your own
		interest.  I could find some work
		for you to do that would be very
		profitable.
			(he rises)
		No hard feelings, eh?  If I can
		ever do you a service let me know.
		You've done a good job for yourself
		tonight.

EXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

By now the musicians have left, but still families are
walking the street, and stopping at the booths.

Fanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and
considers himself highly loved.

Then Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way
home.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's
walk.

We HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a
glimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below.

EXT. FESTA STREETS - MOVING VIEW ON FANUCCI - NIGHT

walking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San
Gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony.

The VIEW LIFTS UP, to the rooftops.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Vito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then
crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the
building.

EXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT

The procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys;
and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried
out into the streets.

The priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in
the street kneel down in prayer.

INT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Fanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the
services in the background.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly
shut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with
it, but no luck.

From the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves
around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one;
it opens.

EXT. THE MONSTRANCE - MED. VIEW ON THE PRIEST - NIGHT

performing the services in Latin.  The ten altar boys are in
attendance.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly
oiled gun that has been left for him.  He slides down into
the building.

INT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT

Fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps.
An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately
moves to her apartment.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		What's the matter, Signora?  You
		don't say 'good evening'?

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

She quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs,
continues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is
always in evidence.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear
door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open
windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the
Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.

He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.

VIEW ON VITO

A slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside
to the alley where he can look into the apartment.

ANOTHER VIEW

Fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

He begins to wrap the gun.

VIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS

Their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious
gift he has bought for each.

CLOSE ON THE GUN

wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW
TILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all
or none of them.  Then something catches his eye.

WHAT HE SEES:

A small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes
up to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the
animal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its
confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's
apartment.

He steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian
shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of
the thumping footsteps of Fanucci.

VIEW ON VITO

holding the wrapped gun, waiting.

WHAT HE SEES:

The white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in
Italian as he throws the cat out.

VIEW ON VITO

squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST
resounding in the building.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying
to reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn
the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun
is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront
of his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into
this vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.

Fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a
terrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside
the apartment.

Vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,
quickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.
Now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,
literally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the
ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the
conclusion of the Mass down below.

CLOSE ON VITO

Pausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and
candles on the streets below.

He empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against
the side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and
breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney.
He smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and
handle, two separate pieces.

He then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate
fragments into various air shafts.

EXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

The Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the
Monstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir
sings.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito is a dark figure, moving with agility across the
rooftops.

INT. FANUCCI'S VESTIBULE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The corpse that was Fanucci, stained with blood.

EXT. PROCESSION - CLOSE VIEW - NIGHT

The statue of San Gennaro, followed by the altar boys.

EXT. CORLEONE TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit
happily on the front stoop of their tenement.  Some of the
men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR
the music and night sounds of the Festa.

A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.

Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance
from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of
wine, and listens to the song.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

listening to the song.  He reaches out and takes the small
hand of his son.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Santino, your papa loves you.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT

The room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.
We can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built
along the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone
enter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony
lies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his
small hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,
Anthony turns, his eyes open.  He is staring, perfectly
awake, at his father.

				MICHAEL
		Can't you sleep?

No answer.

				MICHAEL
		Are you alright?

				ANTHONY
		Yes.

				MICHAEL
		Did you like your party?

				ANTHONY
		I got lots of presents.

				MICHAEL
		Do you like them?

				ANTHONY
		I didn't know the people who gave
		them to me.

				MICHAEL
		They were friends.

He kisses his boy, and then turns.

				ANTHONY
		Did you see my present for you?

				MICHAEL
		No, where is it?

				ANTHONY
		On your pillow.

				MICHAEL
		I'm leaving very early tomorrow,
		before you wake up.

				ANTHONY
		I know.  How long will you be gone?

				MICHAEL
		Just a few days.

				ANTHONY
		Will you take me?

				MICHAEL
		I can't.

				ANTHONY
		Why do you have to go?

				MICHAEL
		To do business.

				ANTHONY
		I can help you.

				MICHAEL
		Some day you will.

Michael kisses him again.

INT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of
the large bed.

Kay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door
to his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down
to the pillow.

VIEW ON THE PILLOW

is a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a
hat sitting in the back seat.

An arrow pointing to him is marked "DAD." Under it, a nine
year old's handwriting says: "Do you like it?  Check YES __
I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it." Michael turns,
looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he
places a check next to "YES."

He starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay
turns, almost in her sleep:

				KAY
		Michael?  Why are the drapes open?

His eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows
of the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a
second's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding
his son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep
across the windows; glass shattering all over the room.

Kay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls
toward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.

Then, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the
shouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as
guards with flashlights come running.

Michael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,
and then gently:

				MICHAEL
		Go with the kids.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT

Suddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns
in an intense blue light.

Groups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all
directions; a state of confusion prevails.  There is no sign
of the attackers.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Michael is joined by Rocco Lampone, his gun drawn.

				ROCCO
		They're still on the property.
		Maybe you better stay inside.

				MICHAEL
		Keep them alive.

Six men take up posts by Michael's house.

				ROCCO
		We'll try.

				MICHAEL
		It's important.

He returns inside.

EXT. MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT

The character of the summer estate has changed: bright
floodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main
gate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the
estate on all sides.

Several men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main
gate.

FULL VIEW

Off in the distance, we see another group of men with
flashlights combing the waterline.  We hear indistinguishable
shouts.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

The wire gates are opened, and the trained dogs go out
yelping into the outer edge of the estate.

ROOFTOP

One of Rocco's men turns the large floodlight scanning
darkened forest areas, where men could hide.

MOVING VIEW

Men with flashlights and dogs.  Moving through the dark areas.

LOOSE VIEW

A small Corleone launch, with a bright spotlight slowly
cruises the boundaries of the estate.  We SEE the silhouette
of men with guns, quietly waiting and watching.

EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Some of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of Michael's
bedroom.

The curtains are drawn from inside.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kay, the children, and some women servants have come down
from the various rooms into the central living area, that
can be most easily secured.  The little girl is still
asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with
their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a
central room.

Michael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:

				MICHAEL
		It will be all right.  We were lucky.

She says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels
over the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She
holds her young daughter in her arms.

The door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is
holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and
puts it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance
away from Kay.

				ROCCO
		Your family all seem to be okay in
		the other houses; your Mother's
		still sleeping.

				MICHAEL
		And?

				ROCCO
		No sign of them yet; but they're
		still on the Estate.

We HEAR loud shouting from outside.

				DEANNA (O.S.)
		Goddamn you!  You're all nuts here,
		I'm not goin' to calm down...

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Through the door, that Rocco opens.

Deanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the
gunshots; while Fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back
into the house.

				FREDO
		Deanna, will you get back into the
		house!

				DEANNA
		I'm getting out of here I said;
		these guys all have guns!

				MICHAEL
		Fredo, can't you shut that woman up!
			(to Rocco's men)
		Get her in here!

The bodyguards, gracefully help Fredo bring the hysterical
Deanna into the safety of the house.

				DEANNA
			(whimpering)
		I don't want to stay here...

				FREDO
		Mike, what can I do, she's a
		hysterical woman...

				KAY
		Leave her alone!  You're talking as
		though she has no right to be
		frightened when there are machine
		guns going off in her backyard.

				MICHAEL
			(to Rocco)
		Have Tom Hagen meet me in the
		Harbor House.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Michael walks the short distance from his house, to the
boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.

A small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the
walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.
It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his
compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.

The boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily
wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure
where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of
emergency.

FULL VIEW

In the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with
their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the
estate.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT

Michael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in
safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.
He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;
there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been
asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down, Tom.

EXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

From outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits
down; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about
something very serious.

The patrol securing the boathouse, walk past the window.
Michael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the
drapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Michael talks intimately to Tom.

				MICHAEL
		There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
		I know that's upset you in the
		past; and you've felt that it was
		because of some lack of trust or
		confidence.  But it is because I do
		trust you that I've kept so much
		secret from you.  It's precisely
		that at this moment, you are the
		only one that I can completely
		trust.  In time, you'll understand
		everything.

				HAGEN
			(nods with this statement)
		But your people... Neri... Rocco;
		you don't think...

				MICHAEL
		No, I have confidence in their
		loyalty... but this is life and
		death, and Tom, you are my brother.

Hagen in very moved.

				HAGEN
		Mikey, I hoped...

				MICHAEL
		No Tom, just listen.  All my people
		are businessmen; their loyalty is
		based on that.  One thing I learned
		from my father is to try to think
		as the people around you think...and
		on that basis, anything is possible.
		Fredo has a good heart, but he is
		weak...and stupid, and stupid
		people are the most dangerous of
		all.  I've kept you out of things,
		Tom, because I've always known that
		your instincts were legitimate, and
		I wanted you to know very little of
		things that would make you an
		accomplice, for your own protection.
		I never blamed you for the setbacks
		the family took under Sonny; I know
		you were in a position of limited
		power, and you did your best to
		advise and caution him.  What I am
		saying is that now, for how long I
		do not know, you will be the Don.
		If what I think has happened is
		true; I will leave tonight, and
		absolutely no one will know how to
		contact me.  And even you are not
		to try to reach me unless it is
		absolutely necessary.  I give you
		complete power: over Neri... Fredo,
		everyone.  I am trusting you with
		the lives of my wife and children,
		and the future of this family,
		solely resting on your judgment and
		talent.

VIEW ON HAGEN

A man who has steadily declined over the last five years,
realizing that total power and responsibility is being
placed on him.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...But Tom, you must know that I do
		this only because I believe you are
		the only one who is capable of
		taking over for me.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

taking out the envelope.

				MICHAEL
		I've prepared this; have had it for
		over a month.  It won't explain
		everything; but indicates where I
		will be, so in a sense, it is my
		life.
			(he hands the envelope
			to Hagen)
		Also, there are three tasks that
		must be executed immediately.  Pop
		would have given those to Luca --
		You knew Pop as well as anyone, act
		as though you were him.  It
		discusses Kay as well; that will be
		the most difficult.  The men who
		tried to kill me tonight, will
		never leave the estate.

				HAGEN
		Will we...be able to get who
		ordered it out of them?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  Unless I'm very
		wrong...they're already dead.
		Killed by someone inside...very
		frightened that they botched it.
		That's why I am going to disappear
		in a few minutes, and leave
		everything to you.

				HAGEN
		But if you're wrong...

				MICHAEL
		If I'm wrong...

There is a KNOCK on the door.

				MICHAEL
		...I don't think I'm wrong.
			(he indicates the knock)
		Yes.

The door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a
knowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a
frightened and agitated Rocco.

EXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

A group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom
and Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs
through the estate.

LOW CLOSE VIEW

Michael's dispassionate face, looking down.  THE VIEW MOVES
to Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the
bridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in
the moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their
throats cut.  Light from the many flashlights illuminates
the grotesque scene.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Fish them out.

Several of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps,
and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they
were.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of
guns they used.

When they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone.
Everyone notices it, but no one says anything.

Hagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given
him in his hand.

He realizes that now, he is the DON.

				HAGEN
		Get rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow
		morning I want a report made to the
		local police, and paper, that some
		explosives we keep on the property
		were accidentally ignited.

The men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the
lighted section of the compound, which now resembles a
prison camp.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. STATE SENATE FLOOR - DAY

The Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor
during a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.

INT. GEARY'S OFFICE - DAY

The Senator steps behind his desk.

				SENATOR GEARY
		All right, Mr. Hagen, you've got
		ten minutes.

He flicks the switch of a small tape recorder.

				SENATOR GEARY
		...and the tape will be running.

				HAGEN
		Actually, I've come with good news;
		the Corleone family has done you a
		favor.

The Senator immediately shuts the tape recorder off.

				SENATOR GEARY
		What the hell are you talking about?

				HAGEN
		We know you're a busy man, with
		plenty of enemies -- we saw the
		opportunity to do you a favor, and
		we did.  No strings.

				SENATOR GEARY
		No strings.

				HAGEN
		You know there's a Senate
		Investigating Committee recently
		set up; we thought it would be
		unfortunate if they were to trace
		anything though-provoking to your
		name.

				SENATOR GEARY
		No one can trace anything to me; I
		pride myself on that.

				HAGEN
		Do you gamble?

				SENATOR GEARY
		A little; what's so thought-
		provoking about that?

				HAGEN
		Do you owe markers?

				SENATOR GEARY
		Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

Hagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the
Senator's desk.

				HAGEN
		The Corleone family has paid them
		off for you...as an expression of
		our esteem.

Geary quickly looks through the paid markers.

				SENATOR GEARY
		There's thirty grand worth of paid
		off markers -- I never owed that
		much.

				HAGEN
		Our mistake.  But what does it
		matter; it was our money.
			(rising)
		We don't even expect thanks.

				SENATOR GEARY
		You paid off thirty grand I never
		owed.

				HAGEN
		We'll keep it quiet; the people who
		know are trustworthy...the Committee
		needn't find out.

				SENATOR GEARY
		And what's the price of their not
		finding out.

				HAGEN
		Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not
		hostile.

				SENATOR GEARY
			(he despises Hagen)
		Thanks...friend.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - FULL VIEW - DAY

There are more men on duty than usual; not that there are
guns apparent, but it's clear that the boundaries are being
patrolled.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Kay exits her house, followed by her children; she helps
them into her station wagon like any housewife, and drives
along the path leading to the main gate.

She's about to drive through, when one of the men steps in
front of her, raising his hand.

				KAY
			(graciously)
		Yes.

				MAN
		I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're
		not to let you through.

				KAY
			(disbelieving)
		I'm going to the market.

				MAN
		If you could just give us a list,
		we'll pick up anything you want.

				KAY
		Whose orders are these?

				MAN
		Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

We notice Hagen walking to them in the background.

				HAGEN
		Kay.

VIEW THROUGH THE GATE

Hagen approaches the car; Kay gets out so they can talk away
from the children.

				HAGEN
		I wanted to explain this myself...
		I had business in Carson City.

He walks with her a little way from the others; the children
run out of the station wagon, and start to play.

				HAGEN
		It's Michael's request...for your
		safety.  We can send out for
		anything you need.

				KAY
		I'm supposed to stay in my house.

				HAGEN
		Within the compound will be fine.

				KAY
		I was supposed to take the children
		to New England next week.

				HAGEN
		That's off now.

				KAY
		I'm going to see my parents.

				HAGEN
		Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;
		and what he did tell me, I can't
		repeat.  But the responsibility for
		you and the kids was the most
		important thing he left me with.

				KAY
		How long does this go on?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry, Kay...

				KAY
		Am I a prisoner?

				HAGEN
		That's not the way we look at it.

Angrily, without another word, Kay turns away from him, and
walks to her children, ignoring the running station wagon.

EXT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - DAY

The luxury liner making its way across the Atlantic.

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - MED. VIEW - DAY

The PURSER followed by several white uniformed associates
knocks on the door of something designated the "Leonardo
Suite." He is holding a telegram.

The door opens, and a tanned Merle peeks out of the door.

				PURSER
			(holding up the telegram)
		I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
		but we have received two telegrams.

				MERLE
			(reluctantly)
		Well...come in.

This entourage enters the suite, an impressive and
beautifully spacious luxury suite.  Connie is relaxing.

				CONNIE
		What is it?

				PURSER
		Yes.  One is from our office in New
		York.  The check that you wrote for
		your passage has been returned.

				CONNIE
		Can't be...

				MERLE
		Why don't you wire your bank?

				PURSER
		The other telegram is from your
		bank.  Your account has been closed
		and the company is warned not to
		extend any credit.

				CONNIE
		I'll take care of it in Naples.

				PURSER
		The company hopes so.  But for now,
		we have orders to change your
		accommodations.

And with that, the men in white begin to pack Connie and
Merle's luggage.

				CONNIE
		That son of a bitch!

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - TINY THIRD CLASS CABIN - NIGHT

Connie and Merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature
cabin in bunk beds.  The little space is crowded with their
trunks and luggage.  Merle can barely hang onto the bunk,
the boat pitches so violently below.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A train speeds across the countryside.

INT. THE TRAIN - DAY

Inside the corridor, a porter advances, and knocks on the
door of a stateroom.  A voice tells him to enter.  OUR VIEW
enters with him as he carries a tray of lunch.  From this
POV we see Michael Corleone sitting in the compartment.

				PORTER
		Mr. Paul?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				PORTER
		You ordered lunch?

				MICHAEL
		Put it right there.

The porter does so; as he places the tray down, he catches a
glimpse of a second person in the compartment with Michael.

HIS VIEW

A very fierce, almost maniacal looking man, BUSSETTA.  He
nods that the porter should leave.

				MICHAEL
		Thank you.

The porter takes his advice and leaves quickly, closing the
door behind him.

VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW

Michael and his mysterious companion have lunch together on
the moving train.

EXT. GULFSTREAM RACE TRACK IN MIAMI - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY

The empty parking lot of the Gulfstream track, on an off-
race day.

CLOSER VIEW

Michael sits behind the wheel of a nondescript late model
car.  Bussetta sits in the rear.

Another car swings into the lot.  Michael starts his car,
and pulls out of the lot; the second car following.

NEW VIEW

This car pulls out and begins to follow them.  Michael
glances back by adjusting the rear view mirror, and nods to
Bussetta.

Michael's car begins to slow down, allowing the other car to
overtake them.

The overtaking car hesitates a moment, moving side by side
with them.

Michael glances toward the driver.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

We recognize Johnny Ola, who waves a greeting to Michael,
and then continues on to lead him.

EXT. SUBURBAN MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ola's car leads Michael's through a middle-class suburban
area of $30,000 to $40,000 homes.  There are small channels
with sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses.
Ola's car pulls up in front of a very simple, tract-type
home.  Michael's car parks nearby.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
			 (to Bussetta)
		You'll wait in the car.

Ola has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path
to the front door.  Michael waits.

Ola rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty,
middle-aged WOMAN answers, remaining behind the screen door.
Ola says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the
door open.

Ola comes down the steps, looks at Michael, nodding to him.
Ola then gets into his car and drives off.  Michael walks up
the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door
behind him.

This woman, TERRI ROTH, is in the kitchen, looking out at
Michael.

				TERRI
		I'm just going to make lunch.  How
		about a tuna fish sandwich?

				MICHAEL
		Thank you, Mrs. Roth.

She hurries halfway up the staircase.

				TERRI
		Hyman...HYMAN, your friend is here.
			(turning to Michael)
		Why don't you go right upstairs, Mr.
		Paul?

				MICHAEL
		Fine.

He continues upstairs; she goes into the kitchen.

				TERRI
		I'll give a yell when lunch is ready.

Michael continues up to a small den on the second floor; we
can HEAR the sound of a baseball game coming over the
television.

INT. HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY

Michael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat
like a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

There, sitting before the television is a small man in his
middle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a
small-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.

				ROTH
		Sit down, this is almost over.  You
		follow the baseball games?

				MICHAEL
		Not for a few years.

				ROTH
		I like sporting events -- I really
		enjoy watching them in the afternoon.
		One of the things I love about this
		country.  I loved baseball ever
		since Arnold Rothstein fixed the
		World Series of 1919...I heard you
		had some trouble.

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				ROTH
		What a mistake; people behaving
		like that, with guns.
			(he shakes his head)
		It was my understanding we left all
		that behind.  But, let me tell you,
		the important thing is that you're
		all right.  Good health is the most
		important thing; more than success;
		more than power; more than money.

				MICHAEL
		The incident of the other night is
		a nuisance that I can take care of.
		I came to you because I want
		nothing to affect our agreement; I
		wanted to clear everything I'm
		going to do with you, just in case.

				ROTH
		You're a considerate young man.

				MICHAEL
		You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I
		have much to learn from you.

				ROTH
			(warmly)
		However I can help you...

				MICHAEL
		The Rosato Brothers have performed
		services for you in the past; I
		understand that they are under your
		protection.

				ROTH
			(simply)
		We do favors for each other...

				MICHAEL
		Technically, they are still under
		the Clemenza wing of the Corleone
		Family, now run by Frankie
		Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died,
		the Rosatos wanted territory of
		their own.  Pentangeli refused, and
		came to me, asking for permission
		to eliminate them.  I, of course,
		knew of their relationship with
		you, and in gratitude for your help
		with the Tropicana matter, turned
		him down.  Pentangeli was furious,
		and paid one hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars to have me killed.
		I was lucky and he was stupid.
		I'll visit him soon.
			(leaning toward the
			old man, sincerely)
		The important thing is that nothing
		jeopardize our plans, yours and
		mine.  This thing of ours, that we
		will build.

The old man touches Michael's hand, warmly.

				ROTH
		Nothing is more important.

				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		Pentangeli is a dead man; do you
		object?

				ROTH
		It's always bad for business; but
		you have no choice.

				MICHAEL
		Then it's done.  I must choose his
		replacement: it cannot be Rosato.

				ROTH
		Of course you must keep control of
		your family.

He turns to Michael, turning the volume higher on the
television, and moving closer to his young partner.

				ROTH
		Michael, these things are
		unimportant.  Who should be the
		manager of a dime store, Joe or
		Jack?  Unimportant.  You do what
		you think is right.  You're a young
		man, and I'm old and sick.  What we
		do together in the next few months
		will be history, Michael; it has
		never been done before.  We will do
		this historical thing together, and
		even your Father could never dream
		it would be possible.  We are
		bigger than U.S. Steel, you and
		me... because in America, anything
		is possible!
			(pause)
		But soon I will be dead, and it
		will all belong to you.

There is a KNOCK on the door, and Terri Roth pushes the door
open with her hip.

				TERRI
		My goodness, you'll rupture your
		eardrums, Hyman.

She puts the tray down, and turns down the television.

EXT. ROTH'S HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

The sinister Bussetta waits patiently in the rear seat of
the car, outside Roth's modest house.

EXT. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - MOVING VIEW - DAY

A black Cadillac moves down the street, slowed by the
Festivities of the Festa that is in progress: people milling
around, buying souvenirs at the many stands set up.

Sausage and grilled meats are prepared, just as they were
years ago.  Electric lights are strung from the street
lamps, and brightly colored banners pronounce the "Festa of
the Madonna."

MOVING CLOSE VIEW

Willy Cicci drives, frustrated that he cannot go any faster.
Next to him, Frankie Pentangeli sits, catching a few seconds'
snooze.

MED. VIEW

The black car pulls up; another car that had been following
it parks nearby.

One of Pentangeli's button men gets out of the car, and
steps into a small Italian restaurant; he exits quickly, and
nods affirmatively toward Pentangeli's Cadillac.

The group of them step out quickly, men huddled around
Pentangeli, and enter the restaurant.

INT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

The restaurant is quite empty, despite the excitement out on
the street.

Pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall, dark,
snappily dressed young man, CARMINE ROSATO.

Nearby, on the other side of the room is Rosato's brother,
TONY, seated with a group of their men.

At another table in the restaurant is a table of Pentangeli's
people: they are joined by bodyguards.

				PENTANGELI
		Rosato, where's your brother?

				ROSATO
		Sitting right behind you.

Pentangeli glances behind himself.

				PENTANGELI
		He don't want to talk?

				ROSATO
		We worked it all out beforehand.

				PENTANGELI
		Are we going to eat or what?

				ROSATO
		Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.

				PENTANGELI
			(sarcastically)
		Forget it; I'm suddenly without an
		appetite.  You're making big
		trouble, Carmine.

				ROSATO
		You weren't straight with us,
		Frankie, what else could we do?

				PENTANGELI
		We could have talked first, saved a
		lot of running around.

				ROSATO
		You wasn't listening, you didn't
		want to talk.

				PENTANGELI
		Don't I look like I'm listening?

				ROSATO
		We want Brooklyn one hundred
		percent.  No more taxes to you.  We
		want to be only loosely connected
		with your family -- sort of a
		under-family all of our own.  Then
		we can act on all internal matters
		without talking.  Also we want you
		to inform Michael Corleone that we
		can deal directly with him.

				PENTANGELI
		I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll
		order something.  Joe.
			(one of his men)
		Get me some bracciole or something.
		And pay cash.
			(to Rosato)
		And in return for these concessions,
		what do you do for me?

				ROSATO
		We will release the hostages,
		number one.  Number two, we're here
		for you to count on when you need
		us.  We're independent, but we're
		here if you need us.  In general,
		we'll cooperate with you and your
		businesses, and you in turn will
		cooperate with us.  Pari persu.

				PENTANGELI
		Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari
		persu...?

				ROSATO
		My lawyer went over this beforehand.

				PENTANGELI
		What assurances do I have that
		there will be no more kidnapping,
		no more hits?

				ROSATO
		The same assurance we got from you.

				PENTANGELI
		What if I say shove it?

				ROSATO
		Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue
		DeRosa will need to be fitted for
		slabs.

				PENTANGELI
		You want a war?

				ROSATO
		We got no choice.

				PENTANGELI
		You know if there's a way I'll go
		to the commission and the commission
		will side with me.  That puts me
		and the other New York families
		against you.

				ROSATO
		We got friends in the commission.

				PENTANGELI
			(getting angry)
		I'm talking about Italians!

				ROSATO
		What about Michael Corleone?

				PENTANGELI
		He supports me.

				ROSATO
		Maybe, yes... maybe no.

One of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian
food.

Pentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he
pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's
hands.

				PENTANGELI
		You drove old Pete Clemenza to his
		grave, Carmine; you and your
		brother.  Turning on him; trouble
		in his territories -- you and your
		demands.  I hold you responsible,
		just as though you shot him in the
		head.  And I ain't gonna let that
		go for long!

Pentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little
tension between the bodyguards of the two factions.

				ROSATO (O.S.)
		Hey, Five-Angels...

He gives him the arm.

Frankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here
and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make
their move out.

EXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

Pentangeli gets into the car.

				PENTANGELI
		Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels
		to my face!

He slams the door.

EXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY

Part of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall
has been torn down, and the other houses sold off.

His car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over
the confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices
something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard
his house.  No one seems to want to tell him.

				PENTANGELI
		What's up?

Pentangeli glances over to the front door foyer.

PENTANGELI'S VIEW

The strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always
travels with Michael.

INT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY

Pentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the
hallway.

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		What's this?

				WIFE
		Michael Corleone.

				PENTANGELI
		One Michael Corleone...Dove?

				WIFE
			(Sicilian)
		He's in your study.

He knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in
his home.

He automatically moves into his study.

INT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY

Michael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his
father's study, although it is totally redecorated.
Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don,
and kisses his hand.

				PENTANGELI
		Don Corleone, I wish you let me
		know you was coming.  We could have
		prepared something for you.

				MICHAEL
		I didn't want you to know I was
		coming.  You heard what happened in
		my home?

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

				MICHAEL
			(furious)
		In my home!  In the same room where
		my wife was sleeping; where my
		children come in their pajamas, and
		play with their toys.

He's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as
suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me take my
		revenge.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, anything.  What is it I
		can do for you?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle these troubles
		with the Rosato Brothers.

				PENTANGELI
		I was just going to contact you,
		Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' -
		in fact, I just come from there.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle on their terms.

				PENTANGELI
		Mike, I don't understand.  Don't
		ask me to do that.

				MICHAEL
		Trust me; do as I ask.

				PENTANGELI
		It would be the beginning of the
		end for my family.  How can I keep
		all my other territories in like if
		I let two wise-guys stand up and
		demand this and that, and then give
		it to them?

				MICHAEL
		Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I
		have your loyalty?

				PENTANGELI
		Always... But sometimes I don't
		understand.  I know I'll never have
		your kind of brains, in big deals.
		But Mike, this is a street thing.
		And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind
		the Rosato Brothers.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				PENTANGELI
		Then why do you want me to lay down
		to them?

				MICHAEL
			(coldly, but convincing)
		Frankie, Roth tried to have me
		killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I
		don't know yet why.

				PENTANGELI
		Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's
		hit 'em now, while we still got the
		muscle.

				MICHAEL
		This was my father's old study.
		When I was a kid, we had to be
		quiet when we played near here.
		When I was older, I learned many
		things from him here.  I was happy
		that this house never went to
		strangers; first Clemenza took it
		over, and then you.  My father
		taught me, in this room, never to
		act until you know everything
		that's behind things.  Never.  If
		Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
		with you in the Rosato Brothers'
		favor, he'll think his relationship
		with me is still sound.  I'm going
		somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We
		have friends in some very important
		business that we're making.  Do
		this for me; you make the peace
		with the Rosato Brothers on their
		terms.  Let the word out that I
		forced you; you're not happy wit
		hit, but acquiesced, just because
		of me.  It will get back to Hyman
		Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can
		trust me.

				PENTANGELI
		Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.

				MICHAEL
		Good.

They embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young
Don, thoughtfully.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

The money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming
tables, and put on a cart with others.

The cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then
wheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room.

INT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY

The guards leave the room; the door is locked after them,
leaving only Hagen.  Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man.
The numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are
spread out on the counting table.

The accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count
and divide the money.

				NERI
		Fifteen percent skim?

				HAGEN
		Twenty-five this time.

The accountant stops, and looks up to Neri.

				NERI
		It might show.

				HAGEN
		Mike wants it.

Neri nods, and the accountant continues.  Neri opens a door,
allowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room.  The
cream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri.

				NERI
		We've never sent this much with one
		courier.

				HAGEN
			(to the courier)
		Your plans are a little different
		this time.  You skip Miami, and go
		straight to Geneva.  It's to be
		deposited to this number.
			(handing him a small envelope)
		And it's got to be there by Monday
		morning, no slip-up.

				COURIER
		I think I was 'picked-up' last trip.
		That hour layover I had at Kennedy.
		I went over and bought a paper...

Neri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.

				NERI
		Those were our people.

				COURIER
		Okay, just thought you should know.

He is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen
gestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of
carefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks
it, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking
inquiringly at Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Let them count.

The courier is shown out through a private door, and then
the first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the
guards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process
is begun all over again, this time with the State Tally
sheets.

INT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY

The courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri.

				NERI
		What's up?

				HAGEN
		No questions.

				NERI
		I got to ask questions, Tom,
		there's three million dollars cash
		in that pouch; Mike is gone and I
		have no word from him.

				HAGEN
		Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm
		the Don.

				NERI
		How do I know you haven't gone into
		business for yourself?

This hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he
owes Neri some explanation.

				HAGEN
		You've been through a lot with us
		so I'm going to give you the truth.
		Mike knows it was someone within
		the compound that set him up for
		that hit.  So nobody is to know
		where he is, not you, not Rocco,
		not even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,
		Al, I know how you feel about
		Mike...but he still remembers Tessio.

EXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT

Michael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is
followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped
onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast
off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

A seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor;
Hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase.
He continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed
in summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men
rather than thugs.

His wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with
her youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.

				THERESA
		Hungry?

				HAGEN
		Just a little.

				THERESA
		I've invited Mama, Sandra and the
		kids for barbecue.

				HAGEN
		What about Kay?

				THERESA
		I couldn't find her.  She's been so
		broody, sticks to herself.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Hagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the
lawn; the littler kids running after them.

Coals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and
several tables are set for the family.

In the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards.

Theresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks.

Hagen relaxes in a sports shirt.

				HAGEN
		Let me try Kay.

He crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael
and his family live.  Is about to knock on the door:

				HAGEN'S SON
		Hey, Pop, heads up!

The football is flying in his direction; he catches it and
throws it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

				HAGEN
		Kay?

He steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but
empty.

				HAGEN
		Anyone hungry?

He moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and
recreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions
and runs across the room.

				HAGEN
		Hello?

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		She's gone, Tom.

Sandra has followed him into Michael's house.

				HAGEN
		What do you mean gone?

				SANDRA
		The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came
		by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried
		to say she wasn't in, but Kay
		spotted them and asked if they
		would take her and the kids for a
		ride.  That was three hours ago.

				HAGEN
			(furious)
		Why didn't someone tell me!

				SANDRA
		I wanted to tell you alone; your
		wife doesn't know what's going on.

Hagen rushes out of the house.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY

Hagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across
the lawn to the boathouse.

				HAGEN'S SON
		Hey, Dad!

This time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to
Rocco, who is by some men near the boathouse.

				HAGEN
		Rocco!

				ROCCO
		I know.  I went down to the Barrett
		house.  But she's gone.  They drove
		her and the kids to North Tahoe
		airport.

				HAGEN
		Goddamn it, where were you?

				ROCCO
		I was in my house.  Willy tried,
		but it would have taken some
		strong-arm to stop her, and he
		figured you wouldn't want that.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

They enter the boathouse.

				HAGEN
			(to one of the men)
		Get me a Scotch and water.

The man hurries behind the bar.

				ROCCO
		She took a flight to San Francisco.
		We figure she's going to connect to
		New Hampshire; her parents' place.

				HAGEN
			(almost to himself)
		I can't let him down.

He swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks
up to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown
such weakness.

				HAGEN
		All right, let me think a minute.

Rocco clears the men out.

				ROCCO
		Me too, Tom?

				HAGEN
		Yeah, give me a minute.

Rocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours
himself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself.

				HAGEN
		Oh Christ, Pop.  It was so good
		when you were alive.  I felt I
		could handle anything...

EXT. VIEW FROM BOAT - FULL VIEW - DAY

A beautiful coastal view of a tropical Caribbean city.  An
extraordinary view, high buildings, palm trees, all set
right on the bay.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

on the cruiser, Bussetta a little distance away, watching,
but never speaking.  The dark-skinned CAPTAIN of the cruiser
keeps pointing repeatedly.

				CAPTAIN
		Habana, Habana.

EXT. HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Michael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making
its way through the streets of Havana.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out the window.

MICHAEL'S POV

Crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the
tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans
walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we
see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,
carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all
of these street impressions, the city is booming with
activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and
pimps and little children begging in the streets.

MED. VIEW

The big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is
sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in
the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees
four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their
hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.
The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away
in Spanish.

INT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Michael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the
hotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently
completed.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH,
who ushers him toward the casino entrance.

				SAM ROTH
		Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.
		Welcome to the Capri; my brother's
		upstairs.  You wanta take a rest
		before you see him, or can I get
		you something, anything at all?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'm fine.

He leads Michael into the main casino.

				SAM ROTH
		This is it!  We think it makes
		Vegas look like the corner crap game.

				MICHAEL
		Very impressive.

				SAM ROTH
		Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,
		I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he
		manages the casino for us.

				COHEN
			(appreciating
			Michael's status)
		Mr. Corleone.

Sam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand.

				SAM ROTH
		Pleasure to meet you, I'm sure...

He gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an
attractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from
a prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller
man, standing to his rear.

				LEON
			(Spanish)
		Most respected gentlemen, allow me
		to welcome you to the City of
		Havana, the Republic of Cuba on
		behalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio
		Batista.

THE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for
this meeting.

				LEON (O.S.)
		I'd like to thank this distinguished
		group of American Industrialists,
		for continuing to work with Cuba,
		for the greatest period of
		prosperity in her entire history.
		Mr. William Proxmiro, representing
		the General Fruit Company... Messrs.
		Corngold and Dant, of the United
		Telephone and Telegraph Company; Mr.
		Petty, regional Vice-President of
		the Pan American Mining Corporation;
		and, of course, our friend Mr.
		Robert Allen, of South American
		Sugar.  Mr. Nash of the American
		State Department.  And Mr. Hyman
		Roth of Miami, and Michael Corleone
		of Nevada representing our
		Associates in Tourism and Leisure
		Activities.

VIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP

Leon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he
lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see.

				LEON
		The President would like to take
		this opportunity to thank U T&T for
		their lovely gift: a solid gold
		telephone!  He thought all you
		gentlemen would care to take a look
		at it.

He hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is
passed in turn to each of the men in attendance.

				CORNGOLD
		Your Excellency, perhaps you could
		discuss the status of rebel activity
		and how this may affect our
		businesses.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing
it on to Hyman Roth.

				LEON (O.S.)
		Of course.  The rebel movement is
		basically unpopular, and since July
		of 1958 has been contained in the
		Oriente Province, in the mountains
		of the Sierra Muestre.

Michael passes the phone on to Roth.

				LEON
			(continuing)
		We began a highly successful
		offensive against them in March,
		and activities within the city
		itself are at a minimum.  I can
		assure you we'll tolerate no
		guerrillas in the casinos or
		swimming pools!

General subdued laughter.

A CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY

Police are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the
cars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is
being driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and
says something in Spanish to the driver.

The driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.

				DRIVER
		He says it will just be a short
		time and they'll let us through.

Michael looks out the window.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

The old building has been totally surrounded by police and
military vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting
lazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready.
There is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the
men brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says
something in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their
weapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of
civilians out of the building with their hands up.

They are moved over to some military truck, where they are
frisked before being loaded.

All of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose,
and rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself
into the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A
second later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously
having hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own
life to take the life of the Captain.

There is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

watching.  The police rush to Michael's car and guide it
outside of the trouble area.

MED. VIEW

as they lead and escort the Mercury out of the area.

EXT. HAVANA COUNTRY CLUB - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Some glasses; rum is poured into them; then Coca Cola.
Quarter limes are squeezed.

				SAM ROTH (O.S.)
		Rum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of
		fresh lime...

Sam prepares the drinks for his brother, Hyman, and a group
of men, including Michael.

				MAN
		Cuba Libres.

				MICHAEL
		I was told the Cubans now call this
		drink: "La Mentira."

				ROTH
		I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		It means... "The Lie."

A moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two
Cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake
on it.

				SAM ROTH
		The cake is here.

They all raise their glasses to the old man.

				EVERYONE
			(ad lib)
		Happy Birthday!

Roth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.

				ROTH
		I hope my age is correct: I am
		always accurate about my age.

Some laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece
on plates, and carry them to the different men.

				ROTH
		Everything we've learned in Vegas
		is true here; but we can go further.
		The bigger, the swankier, the
		plusher the store, the more a sense
		of legitimacy, and the bigger
		business we do.
			(looking at the plate
			brought to him)
		A smaller piece.  What we've
		proposed to the Cuban Government is
		that it put up half the cash on a
		dollar for dollar basis.
			(accepting a smaller piece)
		Thank you.  We can find people in
		the United States who will put up
		our share for a small piece of the
		action, yet we will retain control.

				ONE OF THE MEN
		How much?

				ROTH
		A hundred million dollars.  But
		only if this Government relaxes its
		restrictions on importing building
		materials; we'll need some new
		laws, too, but that will be no
		difficulty.

				ANOTHER MAN
		What are import duties now?

				ROTH
		As much as seventy percent.  Also,
		I'm working out an arrangement with
		the Minister of Labor so that all
		our pit bosses, stick-men and
		Dealers, can be considered
		specialized technicians eligible
		for two year visas.  As of now
		they're only allowed in Cuba for
		six months at a time.  In short,
		we're in a full partnership with
		the Cuban Government.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

is handed a piece of cake.  Roth moves over to a folder of
documents.

				ROTH
			(continuing)
		Here are applications from Friends
		all over the States.  I understand
		Santo Virgilio in Tampa is trying
		to make his own deal.  Well, the
		Cuban Government will brush him off.
		The Lakeville Road Boys are going
		to take over the Nacionale here.
		I'm planning a new hotel casino to
		be known as Riviera.  The new Capri
		will go to the Corleone Family.

MED. VIEW

The cake is sliced and carried to each of the men.

				ROTH
		Then there's the Sevilla Biltmore;
		the Havana Hilton, which is going
		to cost twenty-four million --
		Cuban banks will put up half, the
		Teamsters will bankroll the rest.
		Generally, there will be friends
		for all our friends including the
		Lieutenant Governor of Nevada;
		Eddie Levine of Newport will bring
		in the Pennino Brothers, Dino and
		Eddie; they'll handle actual casino
		operations.

And seeing that all of his friends have been served, Roth
raises his fork.

				ROTH
		Enjoy.

				MICHAEL
		I saw an interesting thing today.
		A man was being arrested by the
		Military Police; probably an urban
		guerrilla.  Rather than be taken
		alive, he exploded a grenade hidden
		in his jacket, taking the command
		vehicle with him.

The various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering
what the point of it is.

				MICHAEL
		It occurred to me: the police are
		paid to fight, and the Rebels are
		not.

				SAM ROTH
		So?

				MICHAEL
		So, that occurred to me.

VIEW ON ROTH

He understands Michael's point, if the others do not.

				ROTH
		This country has had rebels for the
		last fifty years; it's part of
		their blood.  Believe me, I know...
		I've been coming here since the
		twenties; we were running molasses
		out of Havana when you were a baby.
		To trucks owned by your father.
			(he chuckles warmly
			over the memory)
		We'll talk when we're alone.

And he returns his attention to the men who are gathered
with him on his birthday.

EXT. ROTH'S PRIVATE TERRACE - DAY

Michael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that
overlooks the city.

				ROTH
		You have to be careful what you say
		in front of the others... they
		frighten easy.  It's always been
		that way, most men frighten easy.

				MICHAEL
		We're making a big investment in
		Cuba.  That's my only concern.

				ROTH
		My concern is that the three
		million never arrived at Batista's
		numbered account in Switzerland.
		He thinks it's because you have
		second thoughts about his ability
		to stop the rebels.

				MICHAEL
		The money was sent.

				ROTH
		Then you have to trace it.  Michael,
		people here look at me as a reliable
		man.  I can't afford not to be
		looked on as a reliable man.  But
		you know all that; there's nothing
		you can learn from me.  You
		shouldn't have to put up with a
		sick old man as a partner.

				MICHAEL
		I wouldn't consider anyone else.

				ROTH
		Except the President of the United
		States.

He laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between
them.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully
stifles with a handkerchief.

				ROTH
		If only I could live to see it,
		kid; to be there with you.  How
		beautifully we've done it, step by
		step.  Here, protected, free to
		make our profits without the
		Justice Department, the FBI; ninety
		miles away in partnership with a
		friendly government.  Ninety miles,
		just a small step, looking for a
		man who desperately wants to be
		President of the United States, and
		having the cash to make it possible.

				MICHAEL
		You'll be there to see it; you'll
		be there.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - NIGHT

The telephone has just rung; Michael listens.

				OPERATOR
		We have your call to Tahoe, Nevada,
		sir.

				MICHAEL
		Thank you.
			(click, click)
		Tom?  Tom, is that you?

				ROCCO (O.S.)
		No, Tom's out of town.  This is
		Rocco.  Who is this?

Michael is openly disturbed that Hagen is not there.  He
hangs up without answering.

EXT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - DAY

Tom Hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively, and then
steps toward the door of a pleasant New England house.  He
rings the bell and waits, hat in hand.  A moment later, the
door opens, and Kay is standing there.

				KAY
		I'm not surprised to see you, Tom.

INT. SMALL ROOM - NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Out to the yard, where we can see glimpses of little Anthony
playing by himself.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I can't love a man like that; I
		can't live with him, I can't let
		him be father to my children.  Look.

The little boy, moodily by himself.

VIEW ON KAY

obviously moved.

				KAY
		He's not like a little boy... he
		doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want
		to play; he doesn't like other
		children, he doesn't like toys.
		It's as though he's waiting for the
		time he can take his Father's place.
			(almost in tears)
		You know what he told me when he
		was four years old.  He said he had
		killed his Grandfather...

VIEW ON HAGEN

listening, calmly.

				KAY
		... He said he had shot his
		Grandfather with a gun, and then he
		died in the garden.  And he asked
		me... he asked me, Tom, if that
		meant now his father would shoot
		him out of... revenge.
			(she cries)
		How does a four year old boy learn
		the word... 'revenge'?

				HAGEN
		Kay... Kay...

VIEW ON KAY

				KAY
		What kind of a family is this...
		are we human beings?  He knows his
		Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He
		heard Connie.

				HAGEN
		You don't know that's true.  But
		Kay, just for the sake of an
		argument, let's assume it is, I'm
		not saying it is, remember, but...
		What if I gave you what might be
		some justification for what he
		did... or rather some possible
		justification for what he possibly
		did.

				KAY
		That's the first time I've seen the
		lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not
		your best side.

				HAGEN
		Okay, just hear me out.  What if
		Carlo had been paid to help get
		Sonny killed?  What if his beating
		of Connie that time was a deliberate
		plot to get Sonny out into the open?
		Then what?  And what if the Don, a
		great man, couldn't bring himself
		to do what he had to do, avenge his
		son's death by killing his
		daughter's husband?  What if that,
		finally, was too much for him, and
		he made Michael his successor,
		knowing that Michael would take
		that load off his shoulders, would
		take that guilt?

				KAY
		He's not the same as when I met him.

				HAGEN
		If he were, he'd be dead by now.
		You'd be a widow.  You'd have no
		problem.

				KAY
		What the hell does that mean?  Come
		on, Tom, speak out straight once in
		your life.  I know Michael can't,
		but you're not Sicilian, you can
		tell a woman the truth; you can
		treat her like an equal, a fellow
		human being.

There is a long silence.

Then Hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more.

				HAGEN
		If you told Michael what I've told
		you today, I'm a dead man.

				KAY
		When is it finally over?  I want it
		to be over before my baby is born.

				HAGEN
		I don't know.  I hope soon; but
		it's not over yet, and that's why
		you and the kids have to come back
		to me.

He looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with
her safety and her children's.

He is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and
overwrought.

VIEW ON THE WINDOW

Little Anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane,
as though he senses the adults are discussing something of
importance to him.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL-CASINO - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The Baccarat table.  Busy, hundred dollar bills being played.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		Mr. Corleone; Mr. Freddie Corleone,
		telephone please.

				PIT BOSS
		Not here.

VIEW ON THE CRAP TABLES

The play is fast; pit boss presiding; but no sign of Fredo.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		Telephone for Mr. Corleone.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CASINO

We see Neri, ominous, presiding over the entire store.  He
picks up a pit telephone.

				NERI
		He's backstage.
			(and hangs up disgustedly)

INT. TROPICANA BACKSTAGE AREA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Fredo is entertaining two showgirls done up in feathers and
what-have-you.

				FREDO
		C'mon, you got fifteen minutes
		before the finale!  I want to show
		you a trick with feathers.

				STAGEHAND
		Phone for you.

				FREDO
		Don't go away; wait a minute.

He takes the phone; we can catch a VIEW of the show going on
from the wings.

				FREDO
			(on the phone)
		Yeah.  Okay.  Who?  Mikey?  But...
		Si... si, caposco.
			(in Sicilian)
		Sure... how much?  I understand.
		Jesus, three million... I won't let
		you down.  Sure.

He hangs up thoughtfully.

				ONE OF THE GIRLS
		Freddie; we still got twelve
		minutes before the finale!

				FREDO
		Yeah... some other time.

EXT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY

There is a light rain.  Pentangeli steps out of his car;
points to Willy Cicci.

				PENTANGELI
		Wait in the car.

He walks up the street, to the bar, where he is greeted by
the tall, handsome Carmine Rosato.  They shake hands.
Pentangeli looks in his hand.

CLOSE VIEW

Rosato has put a crisp one hundred dollar bill in his hand,
folded sharply in two.

				PENTANGELI
		What's this?

				ROSATO
		That's a lucky C note for our new
		deal.

He puts his arm around Pentangeli, and they walk into the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The bar is fairly empty; and very dark.  Pentangeli and
Rosato step up to the bar; the bartender momentarily stops
polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks.

				ROSATO
		We were all real happy about your
		decision, Frankie; you're not goin'
		to regret it.

He holds up the glass.

				PENTANGELI
		I don't like the C-note.  I take it
		like an insult.

Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around Pentangeli's throat;
and he is forcefully yanked back into the shadows, all the
way into a wooden telephone booth.

CLOSE VIEW

The folded hundred dollar bill resting on the bar.

MED. CLOSE - THE PHONE BOOTH

We see only Pentangeli's feet and legs, struggling.  We HEAR
the terrible sounds of a man being strangled.

CLOSE ON ROSATO

Calm, and then he sees something that disturbs him.

				ROSATO
		Shit, your friend the cop!

Suddenly, the side door opens, and a shaft of sunlight cuts
through the darkness.

				COP
		Everything all right in there,
		Ritchie?  The door was open.

CLOSE ON THE PHONE BOOTH

Pentangeli's feet stop moving.

				RITCHIE
		Just cleaning up.
			(strained voice)
		You okay?

				COP
		Is that something on the floor?

				ROSATO
		Take him!

				VOICE
		Okay.

				RITCHIE
		Not here; not a cop, not here!

Two figures race through the shadows and race through the
doors.

				COP
			(shouting to his
			partner, in uniform)
		Stutz!  Watch out, Stutz!

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

We see that a patrol car had stopped for its routine visit.
STUTZ, the second patrolman, is just stepping out of his
car; Pentangeli's bodyguard, seeing the commotion, leaps out.
Three men, including Rosato, rush out.  There is gunfire;
Cicci is wounded.

MED. CLOSE

The patrolmen is grazed across the face; trying to stop the
flow of blood with his hand.

NEW VIEW

The three assailants jump into the car and drive off.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The stricken Pentangeli comes back to life.  He can barely
move his lips.

				PENTANGELI
		The bastard.  The dirty bastard, he
		gave me a C-note.  He gave me a C-
		note.

He sees the patrolman leaning over him.

EXT. PATROL CAR - DAY

The Sergeant is on the car radio.

				SERGEANT
		Frankie Pentangeli murder attempt.
		Patrolman Stutz shot.  Sahara
		Lounge - Utica Avenue and Claredon
		Road.  White Cadillac three or four
		men took off from scene.  Need

		Pentangeli into custody...

INT. ROTH'S SUITE IN HAVANA - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON ROTH - DAY

His wizened face, pale.  Right now, though, his eyes have a
sparkle as he watches three million dollars in cold cash
being counted on a card table in front of him.

His brother Sam is present, and the sandy-haired Courier, a
little nervous; the one who had left from the Tropicana with
the Corleone skim-money.  Also Johnny Ola.  The money is
evidently all there; Roth picks up a packet; probably a
hundred thousand dollars, and throws it over to the Courier.

				ROTH
		Make it fast; I don't want to
		chance him being seen.

				COURIER
			(frightened)
		What about the arrangements?  How
		can I be sure about the arrangements?

				OLA
		Relax.  You're under our protection;
		the Corleone family will never find
		you.

Ola leads the Courier to the adjoining room where two
smartly dressed Military (Cuban) Police are standing, and a
civilian.  The Courier sees them, looks back to Ola.  One of
the police steps forward, placing the Courier under arrest;
handcuffing him.

				COURIER
		Hey, what's this?

The other takes the packet of money, and hands it to the
civilian, who places it in the briefcase he carries.  The
other officer kneels down and fastens leg manacles.

				COURIER
		The arrangements... YOU BASTARDS!
		What...

The Captain strikes him expertly across the side of his head
with his pistol.

Ola closes the door on this scene.

EXT. THE HAVANA CAPRI - DAY

Fredo Corleone steps out of a car, squints up at the sunshine
and palm trees.  He is holding on tightly to a small satchel,
which he won't let the bellman carry along with his other
things.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Michael and Fredo in a brother's embrace; they kiss each
other.  Fredo is still in his jacket, holding the satchel.

				FREDO
		Mikey.  How are you?

He glances up at Bussetta, who doesn't say a word.  Fredo
extends his hand.

				FREDO
		Hiya, Freddie Corleone.

				MICHAEL
		Mio fratello.

Then Bussetta offers his hand back to Fredo.

				FREDO
			(taking off his jacket)
		What a trip, Jesus Christ, the
		whole time I'm thinking what if
		someone knew what I got in here.

He undoes the combination of the briefcase starts taking out
cash.  Then he stops, remembering that there's a stranger in
the room.

				FREDO
		Oh, 'scuse me.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right.  He stays with me
		all the time.

				FREDO
		Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally
		in the dark.

				MICHAEL
		We're making an investment in Havana.

				FREDO
		Great, Havana's great.  Lots of
		activity in Havana!  Anybody I know
		here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?

				MICHAEL
		Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.

				FREDO
		I never met them.

				MICHAEL
		Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed
		by the Rosato Brothers.
			(pause)
		Didn't you know that?

				FREDO
		No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me
		anything?  I been kept in the dark
		so long, I'm getting used to it.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me, Fredo.

				FREDO
		That's what I'm here for.

				MICHAEL
		Tonight I want to relax with you.
		The Senator from Nevada is here
		with some people from Washington.
		I want to show them a good time in
		Havana.

				FREDO
		Count on me; that's my specialty.

				MICHAEL
		I'd like to come along.  There's
		been a lot of strain, and I've been
		cooped up in this room for three
		days.

				FREDO
		Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour
		to wash my face and do my research
		and we'll have these Washington
		suckers right where you want 'em.
			(then a thought
			strikes him)
		Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He
		always wanted to die in bed...with
		a broad.

INT. ROTH'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael stands at Roth's door carrying the briefcase that
Fredo had brought.

A hotel DOCTOR takes Hyman Roth's blood pressure, while his
wife waits nervously.

				DOCTOR
			(Spanish)
		You must not exert yourself; I will
		write out a prescription and come
		back tomorrow.

				HOTEL MAN
		He's going to write a prescription.

				ROTH
		I want my own doctor; fly him in
		from Miami.  I don't trust a doctor
		who can't speak English.

The doctor is shown out.  Roth gestures to the hotel man,
who also leaves.  Then he looks to his wife.

				ROTH
		Honey, go down to the casino?

				TERRI
		If you feel better...

				ROTH
		I do.  Play the Bingo game.

They kiss, and she leaves.  Also Bussetta and Ola remain.

				ROTH
		My sixth sense tells me you have a
		bag full of money in your hand.

Ola locks the door; Michael nods, and opens the bag, spilling
its contents on the card table.

				MICHAEL
		This doubles my investment.

				ROTH
		Still no word of your courier?
		We'll find him.  But at least this
		will satisfy our friends here.
		You've been invited to the New Year
		reception at the Presidential Home.
		I understand your brother is here
		as well; I hope he'll come.

				MICHAEL
		Six million dollars in cash is a
		high price for a piece of a country
		in the middle of a revolution.

Roth looks patiently at Michael, as though he were a child
who hadn't minded the lesson that he had been taught over
and over again.

				ROTH
		You're a careful kid, and that's
		good.  But look.  An international
		dispatch on the wire service.
		American journalism, not propaganda.
		The government troops have all but
		eliminated the rebels.  All but
		their radio station.

				MICHAEL
		I've read it; I'm pleased that the
		government is doing so well.  As a
		heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How
		did the doctor find you?

				ROTH
		Terrible.  I'd give twice this
		amount to take a piss without it
		hurting.

				MICHAEL
		Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?

				ROTH
			(taken a bit off-balance)
		Why...the Rosato Brothers.

				MICHAEL
		I know that; but who gave the go
		ahead.

Roth glances to Ola; he is not a fool; he realizes Michael
has begun to suspect him.

				MICHAEL
		I know it wasn't me...so that
		leaves you.

				ROTH
		There was this kid that I grew up
		with; he was a couple years younger
		than me, and sort of looked up to
		me, you know.  We did our first
		work together, worked our way out
		of the street.  Things were good
		and we made the most of it.  During
		prohibition, we ran molasses up to
		Canada and made a fortune; your
		father too.  I guess as much as
		anyone, I loved him and trusted him.
		Later on he had an idea to make a
		city out of a desert stop-over for
		G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast.
		That kid's name was Moe Greene, and
		the city he invented was Las Vegas.
		This was a great man; a man with
		vision and guts; and there isn't
		even a plaque or a signpost or a
		statue of him in that town.  Someone
		put a bullet through his eye; no
		one knows who gave the order.  When
		I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I
		knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong,
		and talking loud, and saying stupid
		things.  So when he turned up dead,
		I let it go, and said to myself:
		this is the business we've chosen.
		I never asked, who gave the go
		ahead because it had nothing to do
		with business.

He regards Michael silently a moment.

				ROTH
			(continuing)
		There's three million dollars on
		that table.  I'm going to lie down,
		maybe take a nap.  When I wake up,
		if it's still there, I'll know I
		have a partner.  If it's gone, then
		I'll know I don't.

The old man turns, and moves in his slippers, toward his
bedroom.

INT. THE CORRIDOR - DAY

Michael closes the door, and moves down the hallway.  He is
followed by Bussetta, who had waited in the corridor.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		How sick do you think the old man is?

				BUSSETTA
			(Sicilian)
		He'll live longer than me.

INT. TROPICOR NIGHT CLUB - VIEW ON THE SHOW - NIGHT

A Havana extravaganza, with tall, beautiful showgirls done
up in flamboyant, 'South-of-the-Border' Carmen Miranda
costumes; the lead singer is a six foot blonde doing "Rum
and Coca Cola" in that style.  Her name is YOLANDA.

MED. VIEW

At a large round table, located in an obvious VIP section of
the high, tropically draped room with living ferns and other
tropical planting with artificial stars.

Michael rises, to be introduced by Fredo to some conservative
looking Senatorial types, including Senator Pat Geary of
Nevada.  We notice Bussetta standing nearby.

				FREDO
		Does everyone know everyone, or
		nobody knows nobody.  Here, my
		brother, Michael Corleone... well,
		you know Senator Geary.

Geary warmly shakes Michael's hand.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we
		can spend this time together.

				FREDO
		This is Senator Payton from Florida;
		Judge DeMalco from New York...
		Senator Ream... Mr. Questadt from
		California, he's a lawyer with the
		Price-Control Administration.  And
		Fred Corngold of U T&T.

They all make themselves comfortable.  A waiter with a tray
of drinks appears.

				FREDO
		Gentlemen... your pleasure?  Cuba
		Libres, Pina Coladas, you name it.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'll take a Yolanda.

Laughter.

				FREDO
		Later, later.  All those girls look
		like they're on stilts!

The various tropical drinks are distributed.

				SENATOR GEARY
		To a night in Havana!

They all join in.

				FREDO
			(aside to Michael)
		Jeeze, it's great you came along,
		Mike... You know, we've never spent
		a night out on the town together.
		I always thought you looked down on
		me for liking a good time.

				MICHAEL
		I never looked down on you, Fredo.
		You don't look down at a brother.

INT. THE CASINO - NIGHT

By now the group has made its way into the casino.  Some of
them are crowded around the crap table; Senator Geary is
with the enormous and beautiful Yolanda, who barely speaks
English.  There are other girls with some of the men; not
with Michael, who gambles dollars while talking to Corngold.

				CORNGOLD
		Our information is that Castro is
		dead.  There are maybe a few
		hundred die-hards in the Sierra
		Muestra; but government troops are
		going to clean them out any day.

Johnny Ola approaches Michael.

				OLA
		Mike, can I talk to you.

Michael follows Ola toward the Baccarat table; a watchful
Bussetta moves, a distance away, with them.

				OLA
		Listen, this Senator from Florida
		already has a hundred grand worth
		of markers on the table.

We can see Senator Ream at the table, making thousand dollar
bets on the Bank.

				OLA
		They asked him to sign paper to
		take down the markers; but he got
		mad; told them to wait until he was
		finished.

				MICHAEL
		Let him gamble.

				OLA
		Okay.  You know he doesn't have
		that kind of money.

				FREDO
		Mike said let him gamble.

Fredo puts his arm around his brother; he is high with the
first attention Mike has ever given him, as though finally
he is being taken seriously; as though his brother needs him.

				FREDO
		Mike, I got something special up my
		sleeve for these boys.  You ever
		hear of "Superman?" And I don't
		mean the comic book.

				MICHAEL
		No.

				FREDO
		Wait'll you see!

INT. HAVANA BAR - NIGHT

Our group are in a large Havana bar; the walls totally
covered with hundreds of fifths of different types of rum
and other liquor.

A couple of the girls from the show are out with the men;
Yolanda herself is giving them a private song and dance.

Fredo is a little loaded, and especially attentive to
Michael this night.

				FREDO
		Mikey, why would they ever hit poor
		old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved
		that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember
		when he was just a 'button,' when
		we were kids.  We used to put
		bedsheets on our heads, you know,
		like we were ghosts.  An' ole
		Frankie come peek into our room,
		we'd jump up, and he'd always
		pretend like he was really scared.
		You remember?

				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.

				FREDO
		You?  What do you mean you, I
		thought...

				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.

				FREDO
		You?  What do you mean you, I
		thought...

				MICHAEL
		It was Frankie tried to have me hit.

				FREDO
		No.  I mean, are you sure?

				MICHAEL
		You know otherwise, Freddie?

				FREDO
		Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything.
		Fellas!  You're all falling asleep.
		We got to see Superman.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

A growing feeling about his brother.

EXT. GARISH HAVANA STREET - NIGHT

The street is lit with tons of neon signs; it is alive with
people; some roving bands of musicians.  Everywhere are
little boys running around, begging for money.  And in
doorways and windows are silent, dark-skinned women.

				SENATOR REAM
			(pushing away from
			the palm outstretched
			little hands of the boys)
		Goddamn beggers.  Goddamn city of
		beggars and pimps and whores.  And
		we bend over backwards to support
		them with the goddamn sugar quota.

				FREDO
			(to Geary)
		What's eating him?

				SENATOR GEARY
		He lost a quarter million dollars
		at the casino.

				SENATOR REAM
		...goddamn city of whores...

				SENATOR GEARY
		He gave them a bad check.

INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step-
like around a circular area which becomes a stage.

There are a hundred or so people, practically all men,
tourists and business men, standing on the different levels,
forming the audience.

In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole,
to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white
sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some
Latin music.

MED. VIEW

Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the
spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late
hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using
this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some
important conclusions.

				QUESTADT
		Why do we have to stand?

				FREDO
		Everyone stands.  But it's worth
		it, watch!

VIEW ON THE ARENA

Now two high priestesses, scantily clad, bring in a tall and
muscular Cuban, done up in chains and loin cloth, as though
he were a captured slave.  This is SUPERMAN

VIEW ACROSS THE MEN TO THE STAGE

				FREDO
		That's him; that's Superman!

Some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on, as the
priestesses lead the slave to the virgin tied to the post.
The music is percussive and wild.

MED. VIEW ON THE MEN

				SENATOR GEARY
		Ohmygod.  I don't believe it.

				QUESTADT
		It's got to be fake.

				FREDO
		That's why they call him Superman.
		Johnny Ola told me about this; I
		didn't believe it.

CLOSE on Michael turning away.  Not because of the spectacle
which he finds disgusting, but at what his brother is saying.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		... but seeing is believing.  Ole
		Johnny knows all the places.  I
		tol' you... can you believe it?

If Michael would ever allow himself to cry, it would be now.

				FREDO
			(continuing)
		The old man Roth, would never come;
		but Johnny knows these places like
		the back of his hand...

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - MORNING

Michael is alone in his bedroom; it seems as though he
hasn't slept very much, but sits by his window, looking out
at the city.  He is troubled and tired.

His radio is on:

				RADIO
			(Spanish)
		"This is Rebel Radio: Rebel troops
		of Column Four 'Jose Marti' took
		the town of Baire yesterday at 8:30
		p.m.  The enemy has retreated..."

EXT. CUBAN STREET - MORNING

This street in Havana is like a Caribbean tourist city with
no indication of the revolution in progress.

Michael walks along the street, alone, past the Cubans on
their way to work; past the American ladies who have gotten
up early for their shopping spree.

				RADIO
			(Spanish)
			 (continuing)
		... An important military action is
		developing along a 35-kilometer
		stretch of the Central Highway.
		Numerous enemy garrisons are left
		with two alternatives, surrender or
		annihilation...

One full block away, Bussetta rides in the front seat of the
dark Mercury, driving slowly, giving Michael his privacy,
but never letting him out of Bussetta's sight.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

watching.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Shopkeepers happily luring the tourists into their shops in
broken English.  Havana is prosperous.

				RADIO
			(continuing)
		... Victories in war depend on a
		minimum on weapons and to a maximum
		on morale...

VIEW ON MICHAEL

glances back to the dark car following him.  In a moment, it
pulls up to him, and he gets into the back seat.

EXT. AMERICAN MILITARY MISSION - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

standing by his car, looking through the cyclone fencing
that borders this military training camp operated by the
American Army near the city.

				RADIO
		... War is not a simple question of
		rifles, bullets, guns and planes...

CLOSER VIEW INTO THE CAMP

EXT. HAVANA STREET - DAY

A street singer, followed by a guitarist sings Jose Marti's
words of "Guantanamera." It is solemn, as though it is a
song of protest, a song of the revolution.

Nearby, in a restaurant, Michael has lunch with Fredo.

				MICHAEL
		How is your wife, Fredo...your
		marriage?

				FREDO
			(eating)
		You know her; drives me crazy, one
		minute she's a popsicle, the next
		she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I
		think... I think - I should a
		married someone, like you did.  To
		have kids, to have a family.

Michael turns, distracted for a moment at something the
singer has sung.

				MICHAEL
		"Yo soy un hombre sincero..."
		I am a sincere man,
		From the land of the palms...

				FREDO
		What's that?

				MICHAEL
		The song.  Are you sincere with me,
		Fredo?

				FREDO
		Sincere.  What are you talking
		about, of course I'm sincere with
		you, Mike.

				MICHAEL
		Then I'm going to confide in you;
		trust you with something.

				FREDO
			(Sicilian)
		Mike, are you crazy, I'm your
		brother.

				MICHAEL
		Tonight we've been invited to a
		reception at the Presidential
		Palace; to bring in the New Year.
		You and I will go in a special car
		that's being sent.  They'll have
		cocktails... then dinner, and a
		reception with the President.  When
		it's over, it will be suggested
		that you take Questadt and his
		friends from Washington to spend
		the night with some women.  I'll go
		home alone in the car; and before I
		reach the hotel, I'll be
		assassinated.

				FREDO
		...Who?

				MICHAEL
		The same man who tried in Nevada...
		Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

				FREDO
		But, you told me yourself...

				MICHAEL
		It was never Pentangeli... I've
		always known that.  It was Roth all
		along.  He talks to me as a son; as
		his successor, but the old man
		thinks he'll live forever.

				FREDO
		What do you want me to do?

				MICHAEL
		To go tonight, with me, as though
		we know nothing.  I've already made
		my move.

				FREDO
		What is it?  Can I help?

				MICHAEL
		The old man will never bring in the
		New Year.

Fredo realizes what he means; looks immediately to Bussetta,
who had been sitting near the door and the musicians.  He is
gone.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW ON BUSSETTA - NIGHT

The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us
quickly.  He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite.
Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to
the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears
inside.

A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused
Johnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the
corridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to
return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two
from behind.

INT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

as Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his
head bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of
the couch.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

Guards who are regular troops patrol the Palace in twos,
carrying machine weapons.

Now an elite officer, checks the identification of the
various cars carrying dignitaries, as they are driven up to
the Palace.  The one being inspected at the moment contains
Fredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed
people on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful
mood of this New Year's Eve.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees
with electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body
to the small balcony which all the rooms have.

EXT. THE BALCONY - NIGHT

Bussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony
railing; tying the extension cord to the railing, and
suspending the body so that it is invisible both from the
inside and out during the night.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - VIEW ON THE MAIN FOYER - NIGHT

The PRESIDENT, his WIFE and six oldest CHILDREN great
formally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests.
He speaks to them in Spanish, as one by one they file to him.

Michael and Fredo are presented in a group with several
other Americans, including several of the American
businessmen with interests in Cuba.

EXT. STREETS OF HAVANA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The excitement of the night is beginning to build; people
are out in the streets; poor people, but they are
enthusiastic and lively.

NEW VIEW

Traffic stops, as an ambulance speeds its way to a hospital;
SIREN going.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had
fallen from the couch, and replaces it as though nothing had
happened.  Slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins
Roth's bedroom.  There is a slight commotion; whispered
voices.

BUSSETTA'S VIEW

Terri, Mrs. Roth, is crying.  A group of men lift Hyman
Roth's frail body onto a stretcher.

CLOSE ON BUSSETTA

realizes that this is the man he is to kill.

CLOSER VIEW ON ROTH

He is alive; breathing hard with his mouth dry and open.
The doctor examines him, and then gives instructions to the
orderly who carries him out, presumably to the ambulance.

Bussetta closes the door on this VIEW.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters
serve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  Michael relaxes with
Senator Geary, Major Leon, and several of the Americans.

				QUESTADT
		The embargo on arms shipments from
		the U.S. to your government, was
		just a necessary public relations
		move... Only last month, your air
		force received a major shipment of
		rockets...

Michael glances at his watch; Fredo concentrates on this.

				SENATOR GEARY
		We believe in non-intervention...
		but the agreement stipulates that
		our forces may be withdrawn... but
		as you've seen, we have not
		withdrawn them.

				CORNGOLD
		And my guess is that President
		Eisenhower won't pull out while we
		have over three billion invested
		over here.

				MICHAEL
		Fredo.  Where are you going?

				FREDO
		Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a
		refill.  How about you?

EXT. HAVANA HOSPITAL - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The ambulance makes its way up to the emergency section of
the hospital.  The orderlies quickly carry the old man
inside.  His wife and the doctor, and several of his men,
follow in another car.

THE VIEW ALTERS

and we see Bussetta waiting in the shadows.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The growing crowds of Cubans begin their celebration.

NEW VIEW

A Cuban military detachment speeds along in the night,
motorcyclists clear a path through the celebrants.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

A full sitdown dinner is being served the guests.  Michael
sits at a table at dinner with several of the distinguished
Cubans, and some of the American businessmen.

				QUESTADT
		What's kept Mr. Roth?

Fredo looks up at Michael.

In the back of the room, we notice the detachment of military
moving quickly through the reception room on their way to
the President's private quarters.  Michael notices it as well.

INT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The activity at the end of the hall has come to rest; we can
tell that the doctor tells Mrs. Roth that she should go, the
old man will be taken to a room where he can rest.
Gradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital
staff.

Bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the
old man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to
the room.

HIS VIEW

A nurse sits in the room in attendance; Hyman Roth is
asleep, his mouth wide open, breathing noisily.

VIEW ON BUSSETTA

hears footsteps, quickly steps away from the door, and into
another room.

Some nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in
Spanish; one has brought a small bottle of wine, and
obviously they are inviting the nurse to have a New Year's
toast with them.  They laugh; and the nurse steps away from
the room for a moment.

Bussetta moves slowly back into the room, alone with the
helpless Roth.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW ON THE GUESTS - NIGHT

seeing in the New Year; a great banner is hoisted up in
Spanish, welcoming 1959.

Hands are shaken; kisses exchanged.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

Michael and Fredo in an embrace; they kiss one another.

				MICHAEL
		I've arranged for a plane; we're
		going to Miami in an hour.  Try not
		to make a big thing of it.

He kisses his brother once again.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know it was you, Fredo.  You've
		broken my heart.

Slowly, understanding, Fredo backs away from his brother,
taking the kiss another way.

A little distance away, Major Leon notices an old woman, one
of the President's maids, moving across the alcove, carrying
her suitcases.

				LEON
		What a pity; she's crying.  Must
		have been fired, and she's been
		with the President's family for
		twenty years.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The gathered crowd joyously welcomes the New Year.  We
notice the continual military movement.

MED. VIEW

A family surreptitiously leaves their home, carrying
suitcases and belongings.

INT. ROTH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Bussetta raises a hospital pillow, and easily begins to
smother the thin old man, who can barely struggle.

OUT IN THE HALL

A detachment of military move quickly, accompanied by some
of Roth's men, as though they have important news that must
be dealt with.

They pass the small group of aides and nurses welcoming the
New Year.

Seeing them, the nurse assigned to him, puts down her glass
and moves quickly to the room.

She opens the door, and lays bare the sight of Bussetta
smothering Roth.  Bussetta turns quickly; and one of the
military takes out his pistol and shoots several times at
his head.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

The entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement;
all the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns,
standing with frightened faces like first class passengers
on a doomed ship.  The President himself, his back to our
VIEW, is making an announcement in Spanish.  While he
speaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff,
carrying suitcases and possessions.

				PRESIDENT
		...Because of serious setbacks of
		our troops in Guantanamo and
		Santiago, we feel reluctantly, that
		we must leave the Capital at once.
		Myself and my family must bid you
		goodbye, and good fortune.  We will
		go directly to Ciudad Trujillo.

The crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout
the guests.

The only one who is not completely taken off guard is
Michael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.

				PRESIDENT
		...My only regret is that there
		could not have been more warning...
		As my last official act as
		President, I hereby appoint a
		provisional government with Dr.
		Carlos M. Piedra, as its President.

By now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can
they get out, and with what.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

We see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already
cars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in
haste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees
Fredo, watching him in fear.

				MICHAEL
		Come with me.  It's your only way
		of getting out!

VIEW ON FREDO

Terrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs
away into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

Finally, he has to step into the car and it roars off.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

Rebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news
that Batista has conceded...this throws the crowds already
gathered for the New Year into cheers of joy.

They harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in
their car.

The people pull them out of the car, opening their suitcases,
out of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street.

Michael's car makes its way as the crowd cheers: "El animale
se fue!"

EXT. THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Crowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos
are trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the
families and possessions.

We see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working
their way through the crowds, shouting that they are
Americans in order to get preference on the line.  Often
that declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds.

Sometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but
again, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with
money and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere.

EXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

All forms of private transportation are jammed with people
trying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone
with a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida.

A car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of
their men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a
private cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns.

Within seconds, they are on their way to Miami.

EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

Things are no different at the airport; where anything that
can fly is being jammed with refugees and their money.

A wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast
airplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into
the plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking
his watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks
only English.

				PILOT
		No, this is a private plane.  No,
		this plane is taken.

Finally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches
the Pilot.

				MICHAEL
		He isn't here.

				PILOT
		We've got to leave, they'll take
		this thing apart.

				MICHAEL
		All right.  Go now.

The Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at
them, and begins searching for another plane for his family.

INT. THE PLANE - VIEW ON THE PILOT - NIGHT

as the propeller turns over.

EXT. THE AIRPORT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

Groups of the cheering, celebrating Cubans sing
"Guantanamera," now as a song of triumph.

INT. THE PLANE - MOVING VIEW - MICHAEL - NIGHT

Closer to him, his personal and business life caught in the
middle of history.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - DAY (1920)

He stops to pick out some choice oranges and peaches from a
fruit stand.  Then he reaches into his pocket for change.

				VENDOR
		No, no.  It is my pleasure to make
		this a gift.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

				VITO
		You are kind.  If ever I can do
		something for you, in return,
		please come to me.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY

Despite his new position of 'respect,' there is little
changed about his home.  Only that they have lived there a
while now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable
possessions a young family acquires.

He kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows
her the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something
on her mind.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		What is it?

				CARMELLA
			(Sicilian)
		Come...

They step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman,
waiting nervously.

				CARMELLA
		The Signora is a friend of mine.
		She has a favor to ask of you.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why do you come to me?

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
			(Sicilian)
		She told me to ask you.

He seems surprised; looks to his wife.

				CARMELLA
		She is having some trouble.  Her
		landlord has received complaints
		because of her dog.  He told her to
		get rid of it, but her boy loved
		it, so they tried to hide it.  When
		the landlord found out, he was so
		angry, he ordered her to leave.
		Even if she truly will let the dog
		go.

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
			(Sicilian)
		He said he would have the police
		put us out.

				VITO
			(thoughtfully)
		I can give you some money to help
		you move, is that what you want?

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
		My friends are all here; how can I
		move to another neighborhood with
		strangers?  I want you to speak to
		the landlord to let me stay.

Vito nods to the frightened old woman.

				VITO
		It's done then.  You won't have to
		move; I'll speak to him tomorrow
		morning.

Carmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not
acknowledge.

The old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not
convinced.

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
		You're sure he'll say yes, the
		landlord?

				VITO
		I'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow.
		Once I explain how things are with
		you, I'm sure he'll take pity on
		your misfortunes.  Don't let it
		trouble you any more.
			(as he shows her out)
		Guard your health, for the sake of
		your children.

EXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY

SIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone
angrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings.

He carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil
concerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken
window here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick
up some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to
himself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker.

				VITO (O.S.)
		Signore Roberto...

He rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone.

				VITO
		The friend of my wife, a poor widow
		with no man to protect her, tells
		me that for some reason she has
		been ordered to move from your
		building.  She is in despair.  She
		has no money, she has no friends
		except those that live here.

Signor Roberto brusquely answers, and continues on his way.

				ROBERTO
		I have already rented the apartment
		to another family.

MOVING SHOT ON THE TWO

				VITO
		I told her I would speak to you,
		that you are a reasonable man who
		acted out of some misunderstanding.
		She has gotten rid of the animal
		that caused all the trouble, so why
		shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian
		to another, I ask you the favor.

				ROBERTO
		I've already rented it; I cannot
		disappoint the new tenants.  They're
		paying a higher rent.

				VITO
		How much more a month?

				ROBERTO
		Eh...
			(we sense he is lying)
		Five dollars more.

Vito reaches into his pocket, and takes out a roll of bills.

				VITO
		Here is the six month's increase in
		advance.  You needn't speak to her
		about it, she's a proud woman.  See
		me again in another six months.
		But of course, you'll let her keep
		her dog.

				ROBERTO
		Like hell!  And who the hell are
		you to give me orders.  Watch your
		manners or you'll be on your
		Sicilian ass in the street there.

Vito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable.

				VITO
		I'm asking you a favor, only that.
		One never knows when one might need
		a friend, isn't that true?  Here,
		take this money as a sign of my
		good-will, and make your own
		decision.  I won't quarrel with it.
			(he puts the money in
			Roberto's hand)
		Do me this little favor, just take
		it and think carefully.  Tomorrow
		morning if you want to give me the
		money back, by all means do so.  If
		you want the woman out of your
		house, how can I stop you?  It's
		your property, after all.  If you
		don't want the dog in there, I can
		understand.  I dislike dogs myself.
			(he pats Roberto on
			the shoulder)
		Do me this service, eh?  I won't
		forget it.  Ask your friends in
		this neighborhood about me, they'll
		tell you I'm a man who believes in
		showing his gratitude.

Without a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto
standing in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the
money.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

A thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in
this Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.

He carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is
pursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about
his own age, eighteen.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Kid, where do you live?

				ANOTHER
		Where'd you get those nigger lips?

He tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,
steps in front of him and stops him.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Say 'bread' in Italian.

				ANOTHER
		He dunno.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Go on; how do you say 'bread' in
		Italian?  If you're from the
		neighborhood, you should know how
		to say 'bread' in Italian.

An amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee
house, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the
neighborhood, and loves a fight.

				CLEMENZA
		What's up?

				ITALIAN BOY
		This kid lives around here, but he
		can't say bread in Italian.

				CLEMENZA
		That's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at
		those pregnant lips!

He giggles at his own joke.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Are you a Jewboy?

The boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Well, if you're not a Jew, say
		'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.

And with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,
sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a
clatter.

The other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to
the boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold
of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement
as well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the
sidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.

				CLEMENZA
		Alright, alright, cut it out.

				SECOND ITALIAN
		What for?  He killed Jesus Christ!

Clemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.

				CLEMENZA
		I said cut it out!
			(to the beaten kid)
		What's your name?

				HYMAN
		Hyman Suchowsky.

				ITALIAN BOY
		I don't believe it.  In our
		neighborhood, with a name like that!

				CLEMENZA
		What are those tools?  You work on
		cars?

				HYMAN
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe I know how you can make a
		couple of extra bucks working as a
		mechanic.

The boy seems agreeable.

				CLEMENZA
		But you gotta know how to keep your
		mouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get
		rid of that name.  I'll call you
		Johnny Lips.
			(he giggles at his
			own humor again)
		Come on...

He leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the
side:

				CLEMENZA
		Bread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,
		pane.  Don't forget.

INT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY

A newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new
product "GENCO PURA" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a
new business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one
rattling old truck, and a few stock boys.

Genco has become the accountant-business manager, based on
the experience working with his father.  But it is clear,
that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the
new enterprise.

Genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the
small divided area that Vito uses as his office.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The 'patrone' is here.

				VITO
		Chi?

				GENCO
		Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

Vito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on
tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.

				ROBERTO
		Excuse me, I hope I am not a
		disturbance, Don Corleone.

				VITO
		Yes.

				ROBERTO
		What a terrible misunderstanding.
		Of course, Signora Colombo can stay
		in the flat.  Who were those
		miserable tenants to complain about
		noise from a poor animal...when
		they pay such low rent.

Then abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,
and steps back a respectful distance.

				ROBERTO
		Your good heart in helping the poor
		widow has shamed me, and I want to
		show that I, too, have some
		Christian charity.  Her rent will
		remain what it was.

				VITO
		What was that?

				ROBERTO
		In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!

Vito embraces him warmly.

				VITO
		I accept your generosity...

				ROBERTO
		I won't keep you another minute...

He quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then
makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,
deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned
too jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs
out of the warehouse.

Genco laughs as he watches.

				GENCO
		We won't see him for weeks!  He'll
		stay in bed in the Bronx!

Clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice
the subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no
longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an
imposing leader.

				CLEMENZA
		This kid is good with cars; he
		kiijed at the truck, and says he
		can keep it going.

Vito looks over the lanky young man.

				CLEMENZA
		What's your name?

				HYMAN
		Suchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.

				CLEMENZA
		He's gonna dump that; I call him
		Johnny Lips.

				VITO
		Who is the greatest man you can
		think of?

				CLEMENZA
		Go on, answer him when he talks to
		you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...
		Garibaldi.

				HYMAN
		Arnold Rothstein.

				VITO
		Then take that as your name: Hyman
		Rothstein.

Genco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.

				GENCO
		Vitone!  Look at this!

Vito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly
christened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.

EXT. THE ALLEY - DAY

Genco stands beaming, as two workers raise up high, the
freshly painted sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL COMPANY."

				GENCO
			(enthusiastically)
		God bless America!  We're in
		business!

The young men watch as the sign is hoisted into place.  OUR
VIEW goes from one to the other: Clemenza, Genco, Vito and
Hyman Rothstein.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Willy Cicci, Pentangeli's associate and bodyguard takes a
drink of water.

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to
		the present time, you were an
		employee of the "Genco Olive Oil
		Company."

				CICCI
		That's right.

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		But in actuality, you were a member
		of the Corleone Crime organization.

				CICCI
		The Corleone Family, Senator.  We
		called it, "The Family."

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		What position did you occupy?

				CICCI
		At first, like everybody, I was a
		soldier.

VIEW ON SENATOR KANE

A thin, angular Baptist with a Mid-Western accent.

				SENATOR KANE
		What is that exactly?

				CICCI
		A button.  You know, Senator.

				SENATOR KANE
		No, I don't know, explain that
		exactly.

				CICCI
		When the boss says push the button
		on a guy, I push the button, see,
		Senator?

The Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he
were a curious kind of animal, not really human.  Cicci
reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than
he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a
hypocrisy.

The VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's
attorney, Mr. Questadt.

				QUESTADT
		You mean you killed people at the
		behest of your superiors?

				CICCI
		That's right, counsellor.

				QUESTADT
		And the head of your family was
		Michael Corleone.

				CICCI
		Yeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone.

				SENATOR KANE
		Did you ever get such an order
		directly from Michael Corleone?

				CICCI
		No, Senator, I never talked to him.

				SENATOR SAVOY
			(very autocratic,
			deep South,
			gentlemanly man)
		There was always a buffer, someone
		in between you who gave you orders.

				CICCI
		Yeah, a buffer, the Family had a
		lot of buffers.

EXT. THE TROPICANA IN VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the
hotel.  Michael exits the limousine followed by Hagen and
Neri.

				MICHAEL
		Do you think they have somebody to
		back up Cicci?

				HAGEN
		No.  But if they do have somebody,
		you'll do three years for perjury
		if you give them so much as a wrong
		middle name.

Michael smiles to him, but it's a cold, deadly smile.

				HAGEN
		Michael, take the Fifth all the
		way, that way you can't get into
		trouble.

EXT. PRIVATE BALCONY OF CORLEONE APARTMENT AT TROPICANA - DAY

A Corleone bodyguard waits outside on the balcony overlooking
the pool area.  Through the translucent draperies, we see a
grouping of me.

INT. CORLEONE APARTMENT AT THE TROPICANA - DAY

Michael, Hagen, Neri and Rocco are seated in this luxury in
the hotel.  Michael sits in a comfortable chair in his
apartment.  Neri comes and brings him a drink without
asking, but Michael refuses it.

				MICHAEL
		Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay
		know I'm back?

Hagen nods.

				MICHAEL
		Did the boy get something from me
		for Christmas?

				HAGEN
		I took care of it.

				MICHAEL
		What was it, so I'll know.

				HAGEN
		A little care he can ride in with
		an electric motor.

Neri comes around with a wet face towel, which Michael uses
to cool his eyes.  He puts the used towel down on the table.

				MICHAEL
		Fellas, can you wait outside a
		minute?

They know what he means and leave the apartment, going out
to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear.
Only Hagen remains.

				MICHAEL
		Where's my brother?

				HAGEN
		Roth got out on a private boat.
		He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a
		stroke but he's recovered okay.
		Bussetta's dead.

				MICHAEL
		I asked about Fredo?

				HAGEN
		The new government arrested him,
		held him for a couple of days with
		a lot of the other casino people,
		including Roth's brother, Sam.  The
		American Embassy arranged flights
		for citizens; I'm not sure, but I
		think he's somewhere in New York.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to reach Fredo.  I know
		he's scared, but have one of our
		people reach him.  Assure him that
		there will be no reprisals.  Tell
		him that I know Roth misled him.

				HAGEN
		My information is that Fredo
		thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth
		assured him nothing would happen to
		you.

				MICHAEL
			(indicating Rocco and
			Neri on the balcony)
		They can come in now.

				HAGEN
		Wait... there's something else.

				MICHAEL
		Alright.

Hagen pauses; doesn't know how to begin.

				MICHAEL
			(impatiently)
		Go on, tell me.

				HAGEN
		Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the
		baby.

After a moment:

				MICHAEL
		Was it a boy or a girl?

				HAGEN
		Mike, at three and a half...

				MICHAEL
		What is it, can't you give me
		straight answers anymore!

				HAGEN
		It was a boy.

				MICHAEL
		And Kay...she's all right?

				HAGEN
		She took the Senate Investigation
		worse.

				MICHAEL
		Does she blame it on me?  The baby?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are
bare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras.
Michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar
sight of the home he has been forced to be away from.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the
estate it was warm, and the trees were full.

MOVING VIEW

approaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards
are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates
are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect,
as the car pulls in.

NEW VIEW

Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly
plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the
car as it passes.

The Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is
especially quiet.  Although there are signs that children
live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet
and with a rim of snow still on it.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY

to the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and
looks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children.

NEW VIEW

The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It
is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see
the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children
have been using, and left on a sofa or a table.

He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the
SOUND of a sewing machine running.

Quietly he opens the door.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

into the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the
cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She
hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with
her work.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

stands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And
then without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so
that she doesn't see him.

VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE

onto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he
moves to the house next to his own.

INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY

This is the house where Mama lives with Connie's children,
Connie so rarely is there.

He steps in; his mother is asleep in a chair in the living
room.  He moves to her, and bends low, whispers.

				MICHAEL
		Mom... Mom...

She opens her eyes, which are red and small with age.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		I'm alright.  Will you stay home
		for awhile?

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		There are still things I have to do.

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		Well, we can all have a nice dinner
		together tonight.  How are your eyes?

				MICHAEL
		Alright.  They bother me once in
		awhile.
			(a pause as he thinks)
		Tell me, when Pop had troubles...
		did he ever think, even to himself,
		that he had gone the wrong way;
		that maybe by trying to be strong
		and trying to protect his family,
		that he could... that he could...
		lose it instead?

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		You talk about the baby.  She can
		have another baby.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		No, I meant lose his family.

				MAMA
			(as best she ever
			understood it)
		Your family?  How can you ever lose
		your family?

				MICHAEL
			(almost to himself)
		But times are different...

FULL VIEW IN ROOM - MICHAEL AND HIS MOTHER

Quietly we HEAR the music of a small band playing an Italian
march.  From the orchestration, we know it is from the past.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TRAIN STATION AT CORLEONE - DAY

Vitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the
baby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by
friends, and Mama's relatives.  There is a small band,
playing for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor
car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men,
with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the
occasion.

The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on
the roof, and the car drives off.  The second car, with
bodyguards following.

EXT. DON TOMASINO'S VILLA OUTSIDE OF CORLEONE - DAY

The villa is bloomed with flowers and DON TOMASINO at this
point is a man in his late twenties.  He embraces Vitone and
pats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the
garden.

INT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY

A sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from
America.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and
children eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents
from Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given
to all of the children.

All typically American representing some of the prosperity
and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war.

EXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY

The family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito
shakes hands warmly with the priest.

INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT

The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room.
We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they
belong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD
MAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered
by mosquito netting.

VIEW ALTERS

and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN.

We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who
almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was
a boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the
mosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement
precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.

EXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW

Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil
Depot which is the link to his New York importing business.
They go inside.

INT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY

They are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and
rows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows
his associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used
in the United States.  They all stand around at the link to
their new importing business and share a toast of wine.

EXT. THE BAY - DAY

A team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets.
One sings accompanied by a guitar.

VIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN

He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted
Vito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a
figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels,
it is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old
man.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his
throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little
sound.

Then, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden
by the drying sails.

EXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY

We see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino.
Sitting in the car with him is Vito.

The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and
recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.

MED. VIEW

on an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his
early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as
ever, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the
power as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don
Tomasino is speaking.

We notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some
younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.

				TOMASINO
			(Sicilian)
		Don Francesco, if you will honor
		me, by allowing me to introduce my
		associate in America, in New York.
		His name is Vito Corleone.

The old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who
has taken the name of this town as his name.

				TOMASINO
		We will supply him with olive oil
		exclusively in the town of Corleone.
		His company is called the "Genco
		Olive Oil Company." Here we have
		brought you an indication of how he
		will sell the product.

Tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old
man can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion
of this business.

				TOMASINO
			(Sicilian)
		We have come to ask your blessing
		and permission to continue this
		enterprise.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
			 (in a shrill, high,
			raspy voice)
		Where is this young man?

				TOMASINO
		He is right here, standing next to
		me, Don Francesco.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		Have him come closer, I can't see
		very well.

Vito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right
in front of the old man.

VIEW ON DON FRANCESCO

looking up, squinting against the sun.

DON FRANCESCO'S VIEW

Strangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from
America.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		What is your name?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Vito Corleone.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		You took the name of this town, eh?
		What was your father's name?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Antonio Andolini.

CLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN

The recognition of the name throws a shudder through him.
It is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son
of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had
tried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands
signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		Kill him!  Kill him!

But he is too late; Vito steps forward.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		In the name of my Father, and my
		Brother...

And uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old
man's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.

VIEW ON TOMASINO

has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards,
helping Vito to escape back into the motor car.

VIEW ON A GUARD

raising his shotgun.

VIEW ON THE MOTOR CAR

Just as Tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun
is fired, and he is hit in the legs.

Vito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make
their escape.

EXT. RAILROAD STATION IN CORLEONE - DAY

Some of the townspeople have come bringing flowers and gifts
for Vito and his family.

His wife is radiant with the flowers given her.

The train has arrived and the crowd shout "Ciao, come back
soon."

THE VIEW ALTERS

revealing his good friend Tomasino, waving from his
wheelchair.

VIEW ON VITO

and his wife.  She holds up the baby Michael, and helps him
wave his hand.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

				SENATOR KANE (O.S.)
		Are you the son of Vito Corleone?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				SENATOR KING
		Did he use at times an alias?  Was
		this alias in certain circles
		GODFATHER?

				MICHAEL
		It was not an alias.  GODFATHER was
		a term of affection, used by his
		friends, one of respect.

				SENATOR WEEKLER
			(Senator from New
			York, very smooth,
			partly liberal,
			Tammany Hall)
		Let me agree with that.  Many of my
		constituents are Italian and have
		been honored with that certain
		friendship by my close Italian
		friends.  Up to this point before I
		have to leave this hearing to join
		my own committee, let me say, that
		this hearing on the Mafia is in no
		way a slur on the Italians by the
		Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor
		will I allow it to be.  Italian
		Americans are the hardest working,
		most law abiding patriotic Americans
		of our country.  It is a shame and
		a pity that a few rotten apples
		give them a bad name.  We are here
		to weed those rotten apples out of
		the vast healthy barrel of Italian
		Americans, who are one of the
		backbones of our country.

There is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator
poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he
will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.

				SENATOR KANE
		I'm sure we all agree with our
		esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.
		Corleone, you have been advised as
		to your legal rights.  We have had
		testimony from a preceding witness
		who states you are head of the most
		powerful Mafia family in this
		country.  Are you?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				SENATOR KANE
		This witness has testified that you
		are personally responsible for the
		murder of a New York Police Captain
		in the year 1947 and with him a man
		named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny
		this?

				MICHAEL
		I deny his every charge.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is it true that in the year 1950
		you devised the murder of the heads
		of the Five Families in New York,
		to assume and consolidate your
		nefarious power?

				MICHAEL
		That is a complete falsehood.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is it true that you own a
		controlling interest in three of
		the major hotels in Las Vegas?

				MICHAEL
		That is not true.  I own some stock
		in some of the hotels, but only
		very small amounts.  I also own
		some American Telephone and IBM
		stock.

Michael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering,
and then once again after the answer.

				SENATOR ROGERS
		Why is it necessary for your
		counsel to advise you on that
		question?

				MICHAEL
		Senator, I've observed the head of
		General Motors before a Senate
		Committee, and his lawyer whispered
		in his ear.  That was not commented
		upon in the way you have just done.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel
		interests in the state of Arizona?
		Or any gambling interests in that
		state?

				MICHAEL
		I do not.

				SENATOR KANE
		Do you have interests or control
		over gambling and narcotics in the
		state of New York.

				MICHAEL
		I do not.

A pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his
assistant.

Tom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses
the Chair.

				HAGEN
		Senator, my client would like to
		read a statement for the record.

				SENATOR KANE
		I don't think that's necessary.

				HAGEN
		Sir, my client has answered every
		question asked by this committee
		with the utmost cooperation and
		sincerity.  He has not taken that
		Fifth Amendment as it was his right
		to do, and which because of the
		extreme legal complexity of this
		hearing, counsel advised him to do.
		So, I think in all fairness this
		committee should hear his statement
		and put it in the record.

				SENATOR KANE
		Very well.

At this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the
hearing room.

				MICHAEL
			(reading)
		In the hopes of clearing my family
		name, in the sincere desire to give
		my children their fair share of the
		American way of life without a
		blemish on their name and background
		I have appeared before this
		committee and given it all the
		cooperation in my power.  I consider
		my being called before this
		committee an act of prejudice to
		all Americans of Italian extraction.
		I consider it a great dishonor to
		me personally to have to deny that
		I am a criminal.  I wish to have
		the following noted for the record.
		That I served my country faithfully
		and honorably in World War II and
		was awarded the Distinguished
		Service Cross for actions in
		defense of my country.  That I have
		never been arrested or indicted for
		any crime whatsoever... that no
		proof linking me to any criminal
		conspiracy, whether it is called
		Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever
		other name you wish to give, has
		ever been made public.  Only one
		man has made charges against me,
		and that man is known to be a
		murderer, arsonist and rapist.  And
		yet this committee had used this
		person to besmirch my name.  My
		personal protest can only be made
		to the people of this country.  I
		can only thank God that in this
		country we have a legal system and
		courts of law to protect innocent
		people from wild accusation.  I
		thank God for our democratic due
		process of Law that shields me from
		the false charges made by this
		committee's witness.  I have not
		taken refuge behind the Fifth
		Amendment, though counsel advised
		me to do so.  I challenge this
		committee to produce any witness or
		evidence against me, and if they do
		not, I hope they will have the
		decency to clear my name with the
		same publicity with which they have
		now besmirched it.  I ask this
		without malice, in the interests of
		fair play.

The television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen
hands the document over to the committee lawyer.

				SENATOR ROGERS
		We are all impressed.  The committee
		will now recess over the weekend.
		However, it will continue Monday
		morning, at eleven a.m.  At that
		time, this committee will then
		produce a witness directly linking
		Mr. Corleone to the charges we have
		made.  And then, Mr. Corleone may
		very well by liable for indictments
		of perjury.  However, this document
		will be made a matter of record.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

An army post somewhere in the East.  It is safely guarded.

INT. HOUSE ON THE POST - DAY

where Pentangeli is being held by his constant companions,
the two FBI MEN.

				PENTANGELI
		Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to
		one shot in my favor, and I lose.

				FBI MAN #1
		Get a good night's sleep.  We got a
		new suit, new shirt, new tie, and
		I'm going to shave you myself.
		Tomorrow we want you to look
		respectable for fifty million of
		your fellow Americans.

				PENTANGELI
		My life won't be worth a nickel
		after tomorrow.

				FBI MAN #1
		We have a special home for you for
		the rest of your life.  Nobody gets
		near you.  You're not going any
		place.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, some deal I made.

				FBI MAN #2
		You live like a king.  You'll be a
		hero.  You'll live better in here
		than most people on the outside.

				PENTANGELI
		Some deal.
			(pause)
		I just wish Mike had took the Fifth.

				FBI MAN #1
		Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After
		all these years, why'd you turn
		against him?

				PENTANGELI
		I didn't turn against nobody; he
		turned against me.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE ALCOVE - DAY

A somewhat frightened Fredo Corleone sits in the easy chair
overlooking the lake in this canopied section of the
boathouse.  Rocco sits with him.

INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael is in the dark room with Hagen and Neri.

				MICHAEL
		How did they get their hands on
		Pentangeli?

				HAGEN
		Roth engineered it, Michael.  He
		made Pentangeli think you hit him.
		Deliberately letting him get off
		alive.  Then the New York detectives
		turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My
		informants say he was half dead and
		scared stiff -- talking out loud
		that you had turned on him and
		tried to kill him.  Anyway, they
		had him on possession, dealing in
		heroin, murder one and a lot more.
		There's no way we can get to him
		and you've opened yourself to five
		points of perjury.

				NERI
		They've got him airtight.  He's in
		a military base, twenty-four hour
		guards.  Trying to kill him is like
		trying to like the President --
		it's impossible.

				MICHAEL
		What does Fredo know?

				HAGEN
		He says he doesn't know anything,
		and I believe him.  Roth played
		this one beautifully.

				MICHAEL
		Alright.  I'm going to go outside
		and talk to Fredo.

EXT. BOATHOUSE FOYER - DAY

Fredo sits on the couch.  When Rocco sees Michael, he
automatically takes his leave.  Michael sits in the chair
opposite Fredo.

				FREDO
			(after a pause)
		I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We have time.

				FREDO
		I was kept pretty much in the dark.
		I didn't know all that much.

				MICHAEL
		What about now, is there anything
		you can help me out with?

				FREDO
		I know they get Pentangeli, that's
		all I know.

Fredo gets up, walks to the glass panel that separates the
terrace from the lake.

				FREDO
		I didn't know it was a hit.  I
		swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny
		Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills --
		said he wanted to talk.  He said
		you and Roth were in on some big
		deal, and there was a place for me
		in it if I could help them out.
		They said you were being tough on
		the negotiation, and if they had a
		little bit of help, they could
		close it fast and it would be good
		for you.

				MICHAEL
		And you believed that story.

				FREDO
		He said there was something good in
		it for me...me on my own.

				MICHAEL
		I've always taken care of you.

				FREDO
		Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my
		kid brother, and you take care of
		my.  Did you ever think of that.
		Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do
		this, send Fredo to take care of
		that... take care of some little
		unimportant night club here, and
		there; pick somebody up at the
		airport.  Mike, I'm your older
		brother; I was stepped over!

				MICHAEL
		It's the way Pop wanted it.

				FREDO
		It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I
		can handle things.  I'm not dumb
		Christ, not like everyone says.
		I'm smart; and I want respect.

				MICHAEL
		There's nothing more you can tell
		me about this investigation?

				FREDO
		The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to
		Roth.

				MICHAEL
		You're nothing to me now, Fredo;
		not a brother, not a friend, I
		don't want to know you, or what
		happens to you.  I don't want to
		see you at the hotels, or near my
		home.  When you visit our Mother, I
		want to know a day in advance, so I
		won't be there.  Do you understand?

Michael turns, and starts to leave.  A frightened voice
behind him:

				FREDO
		Mikey?

Michael doesn't stop, doesn't turn back.  He continues off
through the veranda, and out the summer doors.

Neri stops by him.

				MICHAEL
		I don't want anything to happen to
		him while my Mother's alive.

Michael leaves.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

Five cars brimming with Army guards and Agents are waiting
to move Pentangeli.  There is one empty car.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The two FBI Agents are helping Pentangeli get dressed.  He's
in brightly colored striped shorts and bare-chested.  The
Agents help him with the shirt and tie.  One holds out the
trousers but Pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in
the mirror.

				FBI MAN #1
		Ready, Frankie.

				PENTANGELI
		Let's go.

The Agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the
area.  They check the cars waiting, each with two Agents.
They check the gate and note the military sentries.  Then
they stand aside, and let Pentangeli come out.  They get
close to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his
life with their own.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

The Agents put him in the front seat of the empty car, and
get in with him, one at each side.  Another Agent drives.
Now, the first cars start out; the Sentries opening the
gates, and letting the caravan pass.

An Army supply truck comes very close to them, and the
Agents next to Pentangeli become very tense.  Pentangeli
grins.  Then the truck passes on, and they relax.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

The room is crowded with TV journalists, cameras, etc.  We
pick Pentangeli up, closely guarded, being led to witness
chair.

Pentangeli is seated, and made to take his oath.  FBI Agents
are all around him.

MED. VIEW

Anyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked.
The five Senators take their places.

VIEW ON HAGEN

waiting at his long table, very nervous.  He seems startled
by the appearance of Pentangeli.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

catching Hagen's eye.  It's as though he is pleading for
some kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a
traitor.

VIEW ON HAGEN

cold; then he turns away.

VIEW ON THE ENTRANCE

The bustle is settling down; then Michael Corleone enters,
and with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for
this setting.  A burly-chested imposing man of middle age.
Very powerful-looking with frightening magnetic eyes.  His
dress is odd: boots, rough tie, and shirt.  He could be the
tenor out of a Sicilian opera.  He is clearly a country Don,
direct from Sicily, and he dominates the room.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

At first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a
bit shamefaced, but still defiant.

PENTANGELI'S POV

Michael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the Sicilian.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man.

VIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE

Michael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare
directly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear.

VIEW ON THE SENATOR

Notices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences:

				SENATOR KANE
		We have here a witness who will
		testify further on Michael
		Corleone's rule of the criminal
		empire that controls gambling in
		this country and perhaps in other
		countries.  This witness had no
		buffer between himself and Michael
		Corleone.  He can corroborate our
		charges on enough counts for this
		committee to consider a charge of
		perjury against Michael Corleone.
			(then he turns to Pentangeli)
		Your name please, for the record.

				PENTANGELI
		Frank Pentangeli.

				SENATOR KANE
		Were you a member of the Corleone
		Family?  Were you under the
		Caporegime Peter Clemenza, under
		Vito Corleone, known as the
		Godfather?

There is a long silence.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He seems unable to speak.

VIEW ON THE SICILIAN

gazing at him.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

				PENTANGELI
		I never knew no Godfather.  I got
		my own family.

Senator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their
eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their
witness at the last moment.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Pentangeli, you are
		contradicting your confessions to
		our investigators; I ask you again,
		were you a member of a crime
		organization headed by Michael
		Corleone?

				PENTANGELI
		No.  I never heard of it.  I never
		heard of nothing like that.  I was
		in the olive oil business with his
		father a long time ago.  That's all.

				SENATOR KANE
		We have your confession that you
		murdered on the orders of Michael
		Corleone.  Do you deny that
		confession and do you know what
		denying that confession will mean
		to you?

The die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go
all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the
Senator.

				PENTANGELI
		The FBI guys promised me a deal.
		So I made up a lot of stuff about
		Michael Corleone.  Because then,
		that's what they wanted.  But it
		was all lies.  Everything.  They
		said Michael Corleone did this,
		Michael Corleone did that.  So I
		said, "Yeah, sure."

He makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of
everybody.

VIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS

glancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the
Sicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper,
and passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes
to Senator Kane.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify
		to this committee that gentleman
		sitting on your right hand?

				HAGEN
			(coolly)
		Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo
		Pentangeli.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is he related to the witness?

				HAGEN
		He is, I believe, a brother.

VIEW ON MICHAEL AND VINCENZO PENTANGELI

They wait with no expression.

				SENATOR KANE
			(to Vincenzo Pentangeli)
		Sir, I would like you to take the
		stand.

Vincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending.  There may just be
a shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer.

				HAGEN
		Sir, the gentleman does not
		understand English.  He would not
		in any case, take the stand.  He
		came, at his own expense, to aid
		his brother in his trouble.  He is
		not under any jurisdiction of our
		government and his reputation in
		his own country is impeccable.

				SENATOR KANE
			(furious)
		The witness is excused; take him out.

The guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as
everybody else in the room is required to sit still.

				HAGEN
		Senator Kane.

				SENATOR KANE
		This meeting is adjourned.

				HAGEN
			(rising and shouting)
		This committee owes an apology!

				SENATOR KANE
		The committee is adjourned until
		further notice.

For the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen
smiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

The modest champion.  He rises and they take their leave.

VIEW ON THE TWO FBI AGENTS

They watch the Corleone party as they exit.

INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The Corleone nurse is waiting, playing with the little girl
MARY.  A distance away, the boy, Anthony, is standing by
himself.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - WASHINGTON HOTEL - DAY

The door to Michael's suite opens; Rocco leans in.

				ROCCO
		It's Kay.

Michael is sitting in an easy chair; he seems to have
difficulty with his eyes.

				MICHAEL
		On the phone?

				ROCCO
		No, she's here.

Michael rises, surprised.  Rocco steps back, and Kay enters.

				MICHAEL
		I had no idea...

				KAY
		I wanted to see you before you went
		back to Nevada.  Also, the
		children - Michael, they're here.

				MICHAEL
		Where?

				KAY
		In a minute.  They're outside with
		Esther.  I'm very happy for you...
		I suppose I knew that you're simply
		too smart for anyone ever to beat
		you.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you sit down?

				KAY
		I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

				MICHAEL
		There are a lot of things I want to
		talk to you about.  Things I've
		been thinking about -- changes I
		want to make.

				KAY
		I think it's too late for changes,
		Michael.  I promised myself I
		wouldn't talk about it and I've
		gone and spoiled it.

				MICHAEL
		Why too late?

				KAY
		Tell me, Michael.  What really
		happened with Pentangeli?

				MICHAEL
		His brother came to help him.

				KAY
		I didn't even know he had a brother.
		And where is he now?

				MICHAEL
		On a plane back to Sicily.

				KAY
		And that's all he had to do.  Just
		show his face.

				MICHAEL
		That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in
		the old days... there was only one
		legitimate reason to kill a blood
		relative... only one.  IF he was a
		traitor.

				KAY
		You would have killed his brother?

				MICHAEL
		Kay, you've got it wrong.  That
		kind of thing's all over, I promised
		you.  This was between the two
		brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a
		young girlfriend; he called her his
		co-wife.  That was his joke, but he
		meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his
		wife... because she was a great
		cook.  He said he girlfriend made a
		spaghetti sauce once and it was so
		terrible he knew he could never
		marry her.  He set her up in a
		house in Jersey.  She had to be
		faithful... and she had to have kids.
		And she did, two, a boy and a girl.
		He had her checked out and watched
		so she couldn't cheat... but the
		girl couldn't stand that kind of
		life.  She begged him to let her go.
		He did.  He gave her money and made
		her give up the kids.  Then Frankie
		took them to Italy, and had them
		brought up by his brother Vincenzo.
		Where he knew they'd by safe.

Kay begins to realize.

				MICHAEL
		When he saw his brother in the
		hearing room, he knew what was at
		stake.
			(pause)
		I don't think Vincenzo would have
		done it.  He loves the kids, too.
		Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It
		had nothing to do with me.  It was
		between those brothers.

				KAY
		I'll bring the children up now;
		they want to say goodbye.

				MICHAEL
		Kay, I told you...

				KAY
		Goodbye, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I won't let you leave!  Christ, do
		you think I'm going to let you leave.

				KAY
			(meekly)
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		No, I don't want to hear anything.
		There are things between men and
		women that will not change; things
		that have been the same for
		thousands of years.  You are my
		wife, and they are my children...
		and I love you and I will not let
		you leave, because you are MINE!

				KAY
		Oh, I do feel things for you,
		Michael; but now, I think it's pity.
		For the first time since I've known
		you, you seem so helpless.  You
		held me a prisoner once; will you
		try again?

				MICHAEL
		If that's what it takes; then yes,
		I will.

				KAY
		At this moment, I feel no love for
		you at all.  I never thought that
		could happen, but it has.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go back tonight.  Bring the
		children.

				KAY
		You haven't heard me.

He moves to her; he does love her, and is tender with her.

				MICHAEL
		How can I let you leave; how can I
		let you take my children away?
		Don't you know me?  You understand,
		it's an impossibility.  I would
		never let it happen; no, never, not
		if it took all my strength, all my
		cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll
		feel differently.  You see, you'll
		be happy that I stopped you.  I
		know you.  You'll forget about
		this; you'll forget about the baby
		we lost... and we'll go on, you and
		I.

				KAY
		The baby I lost...

				MICHAEL
		I know what it meant... and I'm
		prepared to make it up to you.  I
		will make changes; I can.
			(he clenches his fist tightly)
		I CAN change; that I have learned,
		that I have the strength to change...
		And we have another child, a boy...
		and you'll forget the miscarriage.

				KAY
		It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you
		with your cunning, couldn't you
		figure it out!  It was an abortion;
		an abortion, like our marriage is
		an abortion, something unholy and
		evil.  I don't want your son; I
		wouldn't bring another of your sons
		into this world.  An abortion,
		Michael... it was a son, and I had
		it killed, but this must all end!

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He had no hint, not in his wildest imagination could he have
guessed that she would do such a thing.

				KAY
		And I know that now it's over; I
		knew it then, there would be no way
		you could ever forgive me, not with
		this Sicilian thing that goes back
		two thousand years.

He is silent, though raging -- then, with all his passion,
and his strength, he raises his arms, and strikes her across
her neck, literally knocking her down to the floor, and
hurting her badly.

				MICHAEL
			(coldly)
		You won't take my children.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. THE CORLEONE ESTATE AT TAHOE - FULL VIEW - DAY

A collection of dark cars and black limousines are gathered
to one side.  A few drivers wait quietly.

And then, to the other extreme of the estate, is a small
grouping of about twenty to thirty people, gathered near
Michael's house.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Connie Corleone, dressed simply and now showing her age
without the carefully applied makeup which we have been used
to, kneels down before the shrine of Santa Theresa, and puts
down a bouquet of flowers, along with others that have been
placed there.  We see that some have the simple silk ribbon
with the word "Mama" hand-lettered upon it.

Her two children stand close behind her; they had been
raised by their Grandmother.

Connie steps back, and moves through the small group of
friends and relatives, into Michael's house.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - CONNIE'S VIEW - DAY

Fredo, kneeling by the coffin of his mother in a portion of
the house that has been set aside for the wake.  Fredo
concludes his prayer, wipes away the tears in his eyes and
steps away from the coffin.

He stops when he notices Neri, a little distance away,
looking at him.

VIEW ON NERI

After a moment, he nods respectfully to Fredo, and steps
forward, moving to the old woman's coffin.  Fredo moves to
Hagen, who is there with his wife and children.

				FREDO
		Tom.  Where's Mike?

				HAGEN
			(difficult to tell him)
		He's waiting for you to leave.

				FREDO
		Can I talk to him?

				HAGEN
		No chance.  I'm sorry, Freddie.

				CONNIE
			(who has heard this)
		Can I see him?

				HAGEN
		He's in the boathouse.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael sits quietly in the darkened room in one of the big
sofas, dressed immaculately in suit and tie.  His two
children, also dressed for the wake sit opposite him in the
other oversized sofa, their shoes not touching the floor.
We regard this tableau for a long moment.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
			(quietly)
		Michael?  It's Connie.

She comes in, and sits down by his knees.

				CONNIE
		I want to stay close to home now,
		is that alright?

Michael nods.

				CONNIE
		Is Kay coming?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				CONNIE
		Michael, Fredo's in the house with
		Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom
		said he couldn't see you.

				MICHAEL
		Tom is right.

				CONNIE
		Kids, why don't you go outside for
		a while?

The children don't move; Connie realizes they will only
listen to Michael.

				CONNIE
		I want to talk to you, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		The children can stay.

				CONNIE
		I hated you for so long, Michael;
		for so many years.  I think I did
		things to myself, to hurt myself,
		so that you would know -- and you
		would be hurt too.  But I understand
		you now; I think I do.  You were
		being strong for all of us, like
		Papa was.  And I forgive you, and
		want to be close to you now.  Can't
		you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet,
		and helpless without you.

Slowly, Michael puts his hand on her hair, and touches her
gently.

				CONNIE
		You need me, Michael.  I want to be
		with you now.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

Friends, relatives; Francesca and her new husband, Gardner
and their baby; Sandra Corleone; Teresa, her children; all
the familiar faces of the family are present, quietly paying
their respects to Mama.

Some of the men can be seen in the kitchen, drinking wine,
and talking in low voices.

Fredo is there, broken-hearted over the loss of his Mother;
like some lost child with no friends.

MED. VIEW

Michael enters the room, followed by Connie, who tends
little Mary and Anthony.

He approaches his brother, and then embraces.  Fredo breaks
into tears.

				FREDO
		Christ, Mike.  Jesus Christ, Mike.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

embracing his brother, he glances up.

VIEW ON NERI

quiet, and deadly.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Tom Hagen is talking in the distance to his wife, and one of
his older sons; he kisses, and moves toward the boathouse.
After crossing the lawn, he stops.

VIEW ON SANDRA CORLEONE

waiting there; obviously wanting to talk to him.  He
continues, and she walks with him.

MOVING VIEW ON THE TWO

as they cross toward the boathouse.

				SANDRA
		You're going to talk to him now.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				SANDRA
		Will you tell him?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.

She stops him.

				SANDRA
		Tom, think of yourself for once.
		Don't let this opportunity slip
		through your fingers; don't do it.
		We're all trapped here, don't you
		see?

He continues past her, without answering her.  Continues up
to the boathouse.  He stops before he enters.

HAGEN'S VIEW

Fredo is sitting by the edge of the harbor with Michael's
son Anthony; he is helping him with some fishing rig.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

looking through the window at his son and brother.  Neri
sits in the room, dressed informally.

				MICHAEL
			(without looking back)
		Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard
		about our friend and partner, Mr.
		Hyman Roth?

				HAGEN
		I know he's in Israel.

				NERI
			(hands Hagen the paper)
		The High Court of Israel turned
		down his request to live as a
		'returned Jew.' His passport's been
		invalidated except for return to
		the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires
		yesterday, offered a gift of one
		million dollars if they would give
		him citizenship.  They turned him
		down.

				HAGEN
			(reading)
		He's going to try Panama...

				MICHAEL
		They won't take him; not for a
		million, not for ten million.

				HAGEN
		His medical condition is reported
		as... "terminal."

				MICHAEL
		He's been dying of the same heart
		attack for twenty years.

				HAGEN
		That plane goes to Miami...

				MICHAEL
		I want it met.

				HAGEN
			(understanding)
		Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be
		met by the Internal Revenue; the
		Customs Service, and half the FBI.

				MICHAEL
		I don't like it when you use the
		word impossible; nothing is
		impossible...

				HAGEN
		Mike, it would be like trying to
		kill the President; there's no way
		we can get to him.

				MICHAEL
		I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If
		there's anything certain; certain
		in life; if history has taught us
		anything, it's that you can kill...
			(he stops, then coldly)
		ANYBODY.  But perhaps your
		relucatance is because you've come
		to tell me that you're moving your
		family to Vegas, that you've been
		offered the Vice-Presidency of the
		Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't
		you going to tell me at all?

				HAGEN
		Are you so hungry for traitors; do
		you want to find them everywhere?

				MICHAEL
		They are everywhere!

				HAGEN
		I turned Houstan down; I didn't see
		why I should tell you about an
		offer I turned down.
			(Michael begins to
			confuse him)
		Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure
		of what we're doing; what we'll
		gain; what does the family gain?
		Forget that, Mike; I already know
		the answer.

				MICHAEL
		I know you do, Tom.  Then I can
		count on you to help me do the
		things I have to do.  If not, call
		Houstan, and become a Vice-President.
		Take your family and your mistress
		and move them to Las Vegas.

				HAGEN
		Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've
		always been loyal to you.

				MICHAEL
		Good.  Then you're staying.

				HAGEN
		I'm staying.
			(he pauses...then,
			without being asked)
		Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of
		all this; Sonny never listened to
		me about that.
			(then he sits down,
			and opens his briefcase)
		Now, explain everything to me.

EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

Fredo sits with Anthony, with a silly-looking fishing hat on
his head, covered with lure and flies.

				FREDO
		Anthony, ole buddy, your Uncle
		Fredo's gonna teach you how to
		catch the big fish.  You know, when
		I was a kid, I did this amazing
		thing.  I went out on a fishing
		trip; me and my brothers and my
		Pop, and no one could catch a fish
		except me.  And this was my secret:
			(confidentially)
		Every time I would put the line
		down I would say a "Hail Mary" and
		every time I said a "Hail Mary" I
		would catch a fish.  Now, when it's
		sunset, we're gonna go out on the
		lake, and we're gonna try it.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The guards step aside as Tom Hagen enters the foyer of the
house.  He shows a court order to them and they lead him up
the stairs where he knocks on the door.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

There is a KNOCK at the door.  The two guards show Hagen in
and Hagen presents the court order to one of the FBI men.

				HAGEN
		I think I prefer to see my client
		privately.

				PENTANGELI
		The room has a bug in it.

				HAGEN
			(to the FBI men)
		I'd like to go outside with him, in
		the open air.

				FBI MAN #1
		This room is not bugged.

				HAGEN
		You have guards outside and the
		electric fence.  There's no security
		reason for not letting us talk in
		the yard.

				FBI MAN #1
		Okay.

They pass out of the room.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen and Pentangeli outside, by the electric fence.  They
cannot be overheard.  Pentangeli takes out some cigars and
offers Hagen one.  Hagen takes it and Pentangeli lights both
their cigars.  They puff on them contentedly.  They are
comfortable together, almost.

				HAGEN
		Everything is going to be okay,
		Frankie, don't worry.

				PENTANGELI
		Did my brother go back?

				HAGEN
		Yeah, but don't worry.

				PENTANGELI
		He's ten times tougher than me, my
		brother.  He's old-fashioned.

				HAGEN
		Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to
		dinner.  Just wanted to go home.

				PENTANGELI
		That's my brother.  Nothing could
		get him away from that two mule
		town.  He coulda been big over
		here -- he could of had his own
		Family.

				HAGEN
		You're right.

				PENTANGELI
		Tom, what do I do now?

The light is beginning to turn reddish as the sun falls.

				HAGEN
		Frankie, you were always interested
		in politics, in history.  I remember
		you talking about Hitler back in
		'43.  We were young then.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, I still read a lot.  They
		bring me stuff.

				HAGEN
		You were around the old timers who
		dreamed up how the Families should
		be organized, how they based it on
		the old Roman Legions, and called
		them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos'
		and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, it worked.  Those were great
		old days.  We was like the Roman
		Empire.  The Corleone family was
		like the Roman Empire.

				HAGEN
			(sadly)
		Yeah, it was once.

They both puff on their cigars.  Pentangeli lets himself be
carried away by thoughts of old days of glory; Hagen thinks
of other days too.

				HAGEN
			(very gently)
		The Roman Empire... when a plot
		against the Emperor failed, the
		plotters were always given a chance
		to let their families keep their
		fortunes.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The
		little guys got knocked off.  If
		they got arrested and executed, all
		their estate went to the Emperor.
		If they just went home and killed
		themselves, up front, nothing
		happened.

				HAGEN
		Yeah, that was a good break.  A
		nice deal.

Pentangeli looks at Hagen; he understands.

				PENTANGELI
		They went home and sat in a hot
		bath and opened their veins, and
		bled to death.  Sometimes they gave
		a little party before they did it.

Hagen throws away his cigar.  Pentangeli puffs on his.

				HAGEN
		Don't worry about anything, Frankie
		Five-Angels.

				PENTANGELI
		Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.

They shake hands.  The FBI Agents come out to let Hagen out
the gate.  Pentangeli is led back to the house.

				FBI MAN #1
		Your lawyer tell you he can get
		that 600 years reduced to 500?

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and reflects.

				PENTANGELI
		You boys sure you can't get me a
		broad for tonight?  Give me a
		little party?

				FBI MAN #2
		We got some nice books.

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and gives the Agent a smile an
old man gives a child.  He starts upstairs.

				PENTANGELI
		I guess I'll just take a hot bath.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen walks away; glances back.  Then gets into his waiting
car and drives off.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - FULL VIEW - SUNSET

Michael sits alone in the empty boathouse; in the shadows.

INT. BOAT DOCK - SUNSET

Neri stands by the dock area under the boathouse.  He pushes
the button which lowers a boat by winch and tackle.  He
wears a fishing cap.

He steps into the boat, and pulls the small outboard, which
glides the boat out into the harbor.

MED. VIEW

The boat pulls up alongside Fredo and Anthony.

				FREDO
		Here we go; and remember the secret.

He lifts Anthony into the boat.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Anthony.

THEIR VIEW

Connie, in houseclothes, is calling Anthony.

				FREDO
		He's here; we're goin' fishing.

				CONNIE
		He can't go; Michael wants to take
		him into Reno.

				FREDO
		Ah.  Okay, kid, you got to go to
		Reno with your Pop.

He lifts the boy out of the boat, and puts him on the shore.

				FREDO
		I'll catch one for you, with the
		secret.

				CONNIE
		Hurry, Anthony.

Neri stands the motor; and the boat with the two fisherman
glides off.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

watching, from the dark window of the boathouse.

INT. HIGH SECURITY HOUSE IN ARMY POST - NIGHT

The FBI man knocks on the bathroom door in the house where
they have kept Pentangeli.

				FBI MAN #1
		Frankie, open up.  You okay?

No answer; he hammers on the door.  Using his elbow, and
then a kick he breaks into the bathroom.

HIS VIEW

Pentangeli lying in a tub of water.  His stomach shows above
it.  His wrists are cut and covered with blood.  The bath
water has a purplish tone.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE TAHOE - MED. VIEW - SUNSET

Fredo and Neri are fishing, each with lines out.  The VIEW
MOVES CLOSER, and we can hear Fredo as he holds the pole.

		art thou amongst women, and blessed
		is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

LONG SHOT

The boat on the shimmery lake.

INT. MIAMI AIRPORT - NIGHT

An exhausted Hyman Roth, ill-shaven, and in shirt-sleeves in
taken into custody by a swarm of Customs, and FBI men.  They
allow him to be photographed by press people; and television
cameramen.

				FBI MAN
		Mr. Roth, we have to take you into
		custody.

				ROTH
		Yes, I know.

Some flashbulbs go off.

				REPORTER
		Can you give us your reaction to
		the High Court of Israel's ruling.

				ROTH
		I am a retired investor on a
		pension, and I wished to live there
		as a Jew  in the twilight of my
		life...

				LAWYER
		Mr. Roth is not a well man; he's
		tired of running.

				ROTH
		I'm an old man; at my age, it's too
		late to start worrying.

				REPORTER
		Is it true you are worth over three
		hundred million dollars, Mr. Roth?

				ROTH
		I'm a retired investor, living on a
		pension... I came home to vote in
		the Presidential election, because
		they wouldn't give me an absentee
		ballot...

The newsmen and photographers all laugh, as the FBI men move
him away.

CLOSE VIEW

One of the newspapermen laughing we recognize to be Rocco
Lampone.

He moves closer to Roth, and shoves his revolver right
against his head, and in a second, on camera, assassinates
Roth.  People scream, as Rocco attempts to run down the
airport corridor, limping as he does.

FBI men easily pick him off.

							FADE OUT.

EXT. THE DRIVEWAY BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

A taxi cab waits by the house; its driver sleeping with a
newspaper over his face.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

The cleaning woman, Esther, who had been with Kay for years,
sits by the dining room table, weeping profusely.  Behind
her, in the recreation room, we can see the tableau of Kay
sitting on the couch, her little daughter Mary, between her
knees, talking quietly about things we cannot hear.  Her son
Anthony sits by himself, in another chair by the side of the
room.

MED. VIEW

Connie comes into the house quickly, and moves toward them.

				CONNIE
		Kay, you have to go.

This prompts Esther to weep all the more.  Kay hugs her
daughter, and kisses her many times.

				CONNIE
		You have to hurry; he's coming.

Kay puts her coat on; then stands, and reaches out for her
son.

				KAY
		Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye.

He doesn't move.

				CONNIE
			(angrily)
		Anthony, you kiss your Mother
		goodbye!

He rises, and walks to her.  Hugs her lifelessly.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on Kay, kissing her boy.

				KAY
		Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama
		loves you.

				ANTHONY
		Goodbye.

She restrains any tears; she has become too strong for tears.
Kay starts to go; picks up Mary, kisses her, and starts to go.

NEW VIEW

She steps out the kitchen door; then she cannot help herself.
Crouches down, outside, and calls to her son.

				KAY
		Anthony, kiss me once.

Then she looks up, and slowly rises.

HER VIEW

Michael has stepped into the dining room.  He seems older
somehow; as though some sickness has taken more years away
from him.

VIEW ON KAY

looks at him; instinctively, she takes a step back.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

slowly steps toward her.

VIEW ON KAY

Another step back; the door is still open.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He moves closer to the door; stops, looks at her.  And then
closes it obscuring any view of her.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

It is late fall -- most of the leaves have fallen on the
grounds and there is quite a wind.

MED. VIEW

The water is whipped up by the wind, and the waves are high
as they break against the pavilion.  We HEAR the MUSIC of
time passing, of Michael, of the Godfather over these images.

VIEW ON THE SWIMMING POOLS

They have not been used in several months; they are drained
and the bottoms are mossy and dark.

VIEW ON THE MAIN GATE

Leaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a
hint of someone in the gatehouse.

VIEW ON THE HOUSES

Some of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down,
and put away.  Some of the windows have been boarded up.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

There are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving
impatiently.

As the MUSIC concludes its statement.

MED. VIEW

The peninsula of the private Corleone Harbor.  We see the
figures of two people, seated at a table.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is
attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest
person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the
way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into
the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than
his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its
toll.

				CONNIE
		Don't worry; I'm sure he got here
		on time.  The roads from the
		airport are so windy, it takes
		forever; I've driven them myself.

She picks up some of the serving plates that he has left
untouched.

				CONNIE
		I'll bring him out to you as soon
		as he comes.

She moves back to the main house.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a
moment.  He slowly takes a sip of wine.

EXT. A PLACE IN THE GARDEN - DAY

There are a few chairs.

MED. VIEW ON ANTHONY CORLEONE

He is eighteen years old.

				ANTHONY
		Hello, Dad.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

squinting up at his son.

				MICHAEL
		Anthony.

He rises, and reaches up to his son, who is now taller than
he; he embraces him.

				MICHAEL
		You've grown so tall... so tall in
		the last year.  You're much taller
		than me.

				ANTHONY
		I was taller than you when I was
		fourteen.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I
		waited for you to have some lunch,
		but now it's all dried out.

				ANTHONY
		I'm not hungry.

				MICHAEL
		Well, that's alright... alright.
		Good.  You'll graduate in another
		year, isn't that right?  You know...
		I never finished college.  I was a
		good student, but I never finished.
		Of course, there was a war then.

Connie approaches them.

				CONNIE
		Don't let me interrupt anything,
		this will just take a second.  Here.
			(she takes out a
			small needle, and
			begins to prepare it)
		Your father has to have his insulin
		shot.  Why don't you go to your
		room and put your things away,
		Anthony.

She begins to give Michael the shot.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.

Anthony goes on his way to the house with his things.
Connie gives Michael the shot.

				CONNIE
		Whenever I see that lake so cold, I
		think of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake
		Tahoe is very cold.  They say if a
		person drowns in it, that the body
		will remain mid-suspended --
		perfectly preserved.  Some say it
		will remain forever.

She finishes the shot, puts her things away.

				CONNIE
		Your boy will be right back.

She leaves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

Alone in the garden.

OUR VIEW begins to MOVE CLOSER to him.  We begin to HEAR
MUSIC of the forties; happy music, swing music, as we move

		And Carlo, this is my kid sister

An older, lanky man enters the room, his arms laden with

				TESSIO
		Buon Natale, everybody.  Buon
		Natale...

		Hi, Tom, how's every little thing?

Now the study door opens, and DON CORLEONE enters.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is dinner ready?

		dropping bombs!

				HAGEN
		Well, we could have expected it
		after the embargo.

				SONNY
		Hey!  Expect it or not, those Japs
		don't have a right to drop bombs in

				MAMA
		Please, do we have to talk about

		much less.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He has been listening to this discussion.

				MICHAEL
		Pop, I've decided I'm going to

A quiet hush descends over the table, as though everyone
knows the effect this will have on the old man.  Sonny tries
to make light of it.

				SONNY
		Kid, stay in college.  The girls
		are cuter, if you know what I mean.

				HAGEN
		Pop had to pull a lot of strings to
		get you your deferment.

				MICHAEL
		I never asked for it; I don't want

Disturbed; but wise and prudent.

He disappears into his study.  Michael rises, glances around.
People are generally tense over the situation.  Michael

				MICHAEL
		It's not talk; I'm doing it.

				DON CORLEONE
		You would risk your life for

				MICHAEL
		Not for strangers; for my country.

				DON CORLEONE
		Anyone not in your family, is a

		comes, your country won't take care
		of you.

				MICHAEL
		That's how it was in the old world,
		Pop, but this is not Sicily.

				DON CORLEONE
		I know.  I know, Michael.  It's
		Christmas, your brothers and sister

King.

CLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand.  ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand.
Then it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and
chair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over
this, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance,
as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.

EXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY

We can barely make out the funeral procession passing over
the burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move
slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.

The MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their
instruments harsh and blaring.

They are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the
crude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a
strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the
arms of those walking with her.

Behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and
paisani continue alone behind the coffin.

Suddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians
stop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd
directions along the rocky river bed.

The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,
throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.
We hear a woman SCREAMING:

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		They've killed young Paolo!  They've
		killed the boy Paolo!

EXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY

the parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of
the mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and
veils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to
wail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the
mother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his
fresh blood wetting her strong hands.

EXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY

A boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being
pulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is
to become The Godfather.

The VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by
his Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the
ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.

At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,
or lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy
are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He
wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt
sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat
to protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays
a gold watch and chain over his vest.

He sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,
listening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only
son.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		Don Francesco.  You murdered my
		husband, because he would not bend.
		And his oldest son Paolo, because
		he swore revenge.  But Vitone is
		only nine, and dumb-witted.  He
		never speaks.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		I'm not afraid of his words.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		He is weak.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		He will grow strong.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		The child cannot harm you.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		He will be a man, and then he will
		come for revenge.

As she pleads, the Widow moves closer to the Don, until she
has practically thrown herself to her knees before him.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		I beg you, Don Francesco, spare my
		only son.  He is all I have.  In
		the name of the Holy Spirit, I
		swear he will never be a danger to
		you...

Suddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden
a kitchen knife.

				WIDOW
			(continuing)
		But I will kill you myself!
			(she lunges at the
			Mafia chieftain)
		Vitone, go!

The boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then
there is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother
flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the
terrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn
their attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is
quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.

EXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT

Two men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying
lupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a
loud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.  Their
names are MOSCA and STROLLO.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian)
		Our Friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy Vito
		Andolini.
			(he turns and shouts
			in the other direction)
		Our Friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy Vito
		Andolini.

INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

A family quietly eats their dinner.  The father is the local
policeman, as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun,
hanging nearby.

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian, O.S.)
		Our Friend will be hard with any
		family who gives help to Vito
		Andolini.

One of the children looks up, about to speak.  But the
father sternly indicates that nothing must be said.  They go
on with their dinner.

EXT. THE STREETS OF CORLEONE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The men continue walking up and throughout the streets, far
in the distance.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		...misery to any family who harbors
		the boy, Vito...

INT. A BARN - NIGHT

Four little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and
father bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift
him up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load
of firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically
calm little face.

				FATHER
			(Sicilian)
		Vito...We pray for you.

He pulls the fabric over the boy's face.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		...Andolini...

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		Our Friend promises misery to any
		family...

EXT. THE CHURCH PLAZA - NIGHT

The men continue on their night-walk, up to the plaza of the
church.

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian)
		...who harbors the boy Vitone
		Andolini.

The figure of a single man on a mule passes them.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian)
		Let no one give help to the boy
		Vito Andolini...

The man on the mule makes his way out of the village and
disappears into the distance.

We begin to hear, very quietly, the Waltz repeated once again.

EXT. STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY

huddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in Steerage.
He does not say a word.  The Waltz grows louder as the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled
together with all their earthly possessions on their way to
America.

Then, suddenly, the Waltz stops.

THE NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

SILENCE.  We glide past the Statue of Liberty.

VIEW on the IMMIGRANTS standing on shipboard silently;
looking.  Vito is standing with them, his eyes wide.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the statue, then MOVING PAST, on to the
beautiful buildings of Ellis Island.

EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - DAY

A tugboat pulls a barge brimming with immigrants into the
Ellis Island harbor.  Uniformed officials of the Immigration
Service load them up toward the main building.

INT. ELLIS PROCESSING HALL - DAY

The hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in
the great hall.  Various painted lines lead to the steps and
processing rooms above.

There is the babble of many interviews going on
simultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.

Vito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on
it: "Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia."

He stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant
boys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.
Weak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,
derisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles
to his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in
an icy hatred.

INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY

Three or four interviews are crowded into the small room;
they are conducted in English.  From the expression on
Vito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we
realize that he doesn't understand a word of it.

				OFFICIAL
			(English)
		What is your name?

The man waits, impatiently.

				OFFICIAL
		Your name?

Vito doesn't answer.  The Official pulls the tag pinned onto
his coat and copies to down on his form, using a typewriter.

				OFFICIAL
			(speaking as he types)
		Vito...Corleone.  Step up, over
		there.

He hands the form to another official.

CLOSE VIEW on the form.  The name has been entered as Vito
Corleone.

INT. MEDICAL EXAM - DAY

Vito is stripped to the waist, as other immigrants wait.

The DOCTOR is just finishing his examination.  He shakes his
head, and then writes on the medical form.

				DOCTOR
		Can you understand me?

Vito stares blankly.

				DOCTOR
		You understand?  Smallpox.  Smallpox.

He doesn't understand.  The doctor turns to the Immigration
Official.

				DOCTOR
		Quarantine...six months.

UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Officials move a group of immigrant men, including Vito, to
the quarantine section of the Island.

INT. QUARANTINE HALLWAY - DAY

The official stops at each doorway, and reads off a name.

				OFFICIAL
		Salvatore Ormenta.

The man moves into the room, and the group proceeds.

				OFFICIAL
		Vito Corleone.

No one responds.  The guard moves to the boy, reads his new
name tag.  And then, not unkindly:

				GUARD
		That's you.

He opens the door, and Vito enters the room.

EXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

The VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be
the view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands
on his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred
window.

Then he turns, and sits in the corner.  He is silent for a
long time.

Then, in a sweet, pure voice, he sings to himself in Sicilian.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - MOVING CLOSE SHOT - DAY

A nine year old boy, dressed immaculately in white, with a
large white silk bow tied to his shoulder, moving slowly
down the aisle of the church with a group of other children
dressed in white.  He has dark black hair, and his face is
unmistakably similar to young Vito's.  He moves slowly, his
hands clasped around a golden missal.  We HEAR only the pure
voice of Vito in Sicilian, his sad song reaching out from
the past, as ANTHONY CORLEONE, his Grandson, moves on the
way to his First Holy Communion more than fifty years later.

FULL VIEW

The little children move in procession down to the Altar,
where the PRIEST raises the Host, and performs the Communion
Mass in Latin.

				PRIEST
		Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit
		peccata mundi.

MOVING VIEW ON THE PRIEST

and Altar boys, as he moves along the row of kneeling
children, blessing them, and administering their first
Communion.

CLOSE MOVING VIEW

as the innocent faces receive the Host; finally, the Priest
comes to Anthony.

				PRIEST
		Corpus Christi.

				ANTHONY
		Amen.

EXT. LAKE TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe
are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the
First Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Michael Corleone.  A full dance orchestra plays music
of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for
the occasion.  Speedboats roar through the water, pulling
youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are
filled with laughing, swimming guests.  It is Fall of 1958.

MED. VIEW

Anthony, in his Communion suit sits alone at the table,
looking like a lonely young Prince.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Smile, Anthony.  Smile.

He does, and a flash goes off.

				PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
		Now, one with the whole family.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Mr. Corleone can't right now...

KAY CORLEONE enters from the side, leading her four year old
daughter, MARY, and MAMA CORLEONE to pose with Anthony.

				KAY (O.S.)
		...but we'll get one with the ladies.

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		All together now, c'mon, Anthony...
		CHEESE and
			(flash)

				KAY
		Thank you.

She smiles as she leaves the photographer, and then lets out
a weary sigh to Mama, as she touches the slightly protruding
belly.

				KAY
		Do you think it'll show in the
		picture?

				MAMA
		Two months never shows.  Two months
		look like you had a big lunch.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Oh, Mrs. Corleone.

A slender, aristocratic WOMAN in her late forties is waving
to KAY.

				MRS. BARRETT
		Hello, Mrs. Corleone.  I'm Fran
		Barrett, our place is just down the
		lake.  This is my husband, Marshall.

				KAY
		I'm so happy you could come.

				MR. BARRETT
		The place is transformed.  We've
		been watching workmen come and go
		all summer.

				MRS. BARRETT
		Where is Mr. Corleone?

				KAY
		A business meeting ran late...but
		he promised he wouldn't be long.

Kay puts her arm around little Anthony's shoulder.

				KAY
		This is our son Anthony Vito
		Corleone.  Today he made his First
		Holy Communion.

EXT. TAHOE GATE AND KENNELS - DAY

A confusion of cars; arriving and parking.  The squad of
parking attendants are supplemented by a whole team of the
local Police, working as high-class parking valets.

A very beautiful, statuesque woman, though slightly drunk,
DEANNA DUNN, slams the door of a powder blue Mercedes and
hurries barefoot through the great stone gate.

				DEANNA
		I will not shut my mouth, and keep
		your Goddamn hands off of me!

She is followed by a harried, FREDDIE CORLEONE, dressed with
flash in the Hollywood style, and carrying her shoes in his
hands.

				FREDO
		Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for
		a drive.

				DEANNA
		I just had a drive; besides, I want
		to see my brother-in-law Michael.

				FREDO
			(trying to get her to
			put her shoes on)
		Yeah, but I don't want him to see
		you.

Deanna pauses reflectively a moment, allowing Fredo to get
her shoes on.

				DEANNA
		What beats me, is how you guys
		could be brothers.  You musta been
		your Mother's rotten egg.

She kicks off the shoes, giggling, and runs toward a waiter.

				DEANNA
			(lifting a glass of champagne)
		Young man, young man...thank you,
		young man.

				WAITER
			(impressed)
		Excuse me, but aren't you...

				DEANNA
		Yes, you saw me in the movies, Good
		Humor man, and yes, I had more off
		than my shoes!

				FREDO
		Goddamn bitch.

				DEANNA
		Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance
		with me.

She extends her hand to him.

				FREDO
		Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice
		people here.  Friends of Kay's.
		He'll never forgive me if you ruin
		his party.

				DEANNA
		I hate to see you cringe in front
		of him.  How come you're so scared
		of your own kid brother?

				FREDO
		He's the head of the family.

Disgusted, she turns around, and heads toward the music.

				DEANNA
		Don't follow me!

EXT. TAHOE LAWN AND TABLES - MED. SHOT - DAY

Rushing through the tables, waving an arm jangling with gold
jewelry, and carrying several gift-wrapped packages, is a
hardened and aging CONNIE CORLEONE.  She is followed by a
blond, and wrinkled-handsome escort named MERLE.

				CONNIE
		Mama...Mama!  Here I am!

She throws her arms around her Mother, who returns the
affection somewhat reproachfully.

				MAMA
		Constanzia.  We expected you last
		week; we sent the car to pick you
		up at the airport last week.

				CONNIE
		I know, it was chaos; but anyway,
		here I am one week late.
			(lifting a shiny
			green package out of
			Merle's arms)
		This is for my Mama.  You remember
		Merle?

				MAMA
			(not giving him a
			chance to greet her)
		Yes, thank you.

				CONNIE
		How are the kids?

				MAMA
		Well, thank you, they asked for you
		all week.

				CONNIE
		I got surprises for everybody!

				MAMA
			(glancing at the wrapping)
		Bought at the airport.

				CONNIE
			(gazing about)
		This is swell.  Where's Michael?
		I've got things to get straight
		with him and I can't wait on line.

				MAMA
		You go see your children first, and
		then you wait to see your brother
		like everybody else.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A porch-like foyer of the boathouse, where a group of five
or six men wait, some nervously.  Some sit, and some pace.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on one of these men, FRANKIE PENTANGELI, approaching his
sixties, with gray hair (the little of it left).  He's a bit
scruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not
perfect, and he seems tired.  He is accompanied by an
associate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also
dressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the
attention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man
in white sports jacket and black bow-tie.

				PENTANGELI
		Hey, kid!  You got any red wine?

				WAITER
			(offering the tray)
		Only champagne and cocktails.

				PENTANGELI
		Forget it...

Finally, he sees someone he recognizes, Fredo, and shouts
out in a husky voice:

				PENTANGELI
		Fredo!  Sonuvabitch.  You look great.

Fredo squints in his direction; finally recognizes him.

				FREDO
		Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie
		"Five-Angels"...thought you were
		never coming West.

				PENTANGELI
			(affectionately)
		Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey,
		what's with the food?  Some kid in
		a white jacket brings me a ritz
		cracker with some chopped liver.
		'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a
		peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker
		with chopped liver.' Go get me a
		salami sandwich and a glass of wine
		or I'll send you and your white
		jacket to the dry cleaners!

They get a good laugh at this fresh breath of New York.

				FREDO
		Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you.
		Reminds me of old times.

				PENTANGELI
		You remember Willy Cicci, don't
		you, Freddie?  We was all together
		with the old man Clemenza in
		Brooklyn... before...uh...

				FREDO
		We were all upset about that.

				PENTANGELI
		That's what I'm here to talk to
		your brother about.  What's with
		him, I got to get a letter of
		introduction to have a 'sitdown'?

				FREDO
			(throwing his arm
			around him)
		C'mon, I see what I can do.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - MED. VIEW - DAY

The orchestra wears white summer sportcoats and black tuxedo
slacks as they play a tango behind monogrammed music stands.
A professional dance team, probably imported from Vegas,
dance the tango for the excited guests.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake.  It is
dominated by an enormous bar, behind which stands ALBERT
NERI, discreetly in the background.

MICHAEL CORLEONE sits on a large sofa, his back to us.
Standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy TOM
HAGEN.  Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's
widow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE,
and a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.

				SANDRA
		Michael, this is Gardner Shaw.
		Francesca and he have been seeing
		each other for six months now.
		Gardner, this is Francie's Uncle
		Michael.

				GARDNER
			(a little nervous)
		I've heard a lot about you, Mr.
		Corleone.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Sit down.  Francie.

The couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite Michael.

				SANDRA
		They would like to set an engagement
		date, and...

				MICHAEL
		Let them speak for themselves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL, calm, thoughtful.  One can tell that he has
special affection for his niece.

				FRANCESCA
		We love each other, Uncle Michael.
		And, we want to be married.  I came
		to ask for your blessing.

There is a loud KNOCKING on the door; then Fredo's voice.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		Hey, Mike...guess who's here?

Neri goes to answer it, cracks the door open.

				NERI
		Not now, Freddie...

				FREDO
		Tell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels' is
		here.

				NERI
		Not now...

Neri closes the door, and Michael looks at the nervous young
man.

				MICHAEL
		Francesca is my oldest brother's
		daughter.  He died many years ago,
		and ever since I've felt much more
		of a father than an uncle.  I love
		her very much.  I'm pleased and
		impressed that you had the thought
		to come to me before going on with
		your plans.  It shows me that
		you're a considerate man, and will
		be good to her.  What are you
		studying in college?

				GARDNER
		My major is Fine Arts, sir.

				MICHAEL
		How will Fine Arts support your new
		wife?

				GARDNER
		It's embarrassing to say, sir, but
		I'm a major stockholder in the
		family corporation.

				MICHAEL
			(smiling)
		Never be embarrassed by your wealth.
		This recent contempt for money is
		still another trick of the rich to
		keep the poor without it.
			(warmly)
		Of course I give you my blessing.
		Let's set the wedding soon...it
		will be my pleasure to give the
		bride away.

They all smile, and rise.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...and take a few courses in
		Business Administration just to be
		on the safe side!

They laugh; Michael moves toward them.  Francesca throws her
arms around him, and kisses her favorite uncle.  The flushed
young man shakes his hand heartily.

				FRANCESCA
		Thank you, Uncle Michael.

They all take their leave; Michael turns to Hagen.

				MICHAEL
		Make her dowry impressive.  He
		comes from a family who still
		thinks an Italian bride goes
		barefoot.

EXT. TAHOE SWIMMING POOLS AND HARBOR - DAY

Francesca and Gardner are greeted by her twin sister and
their young friends, who squeal and embrace at the good news.
Someone throws someone in the pool, and life is good.

MED. CLOSE

Francesca kisses her Aunt Kay.

				FRANCESCA
		Uncle Michael is the greatest man
		ever!

VIEW on Kay - happy for her niece.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael sits in the darkened boathouse.  Tom Hagen paces.
Michael is looking at photographs.  Neri stands over him.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

studying the pictures.

				NERI (O.S.)
		His name is Fred Vincent.  He owns
		a small pizza parlor in Buffalo...

CLOSE ON THE PICTURES

Snapshots of a middle-aged man, handsome, Italian.  There is
something familiar about him.

				NERI (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		...American wife and two small kids.
		We traced him and found that he's
		in the country illegally, from
		Sicily...

Michael looks at another picture.  The same man.  Only
younger, and dressed in Sicilian shepherd's clothing.  We
remember him as FABRIZZIO...Michael's traitorous bodyguard
in Sicily.

				NERI (O.S.)
		...came over around 1956.  Sponsored
		by the Barzini Family.

Michael puts the pictures down.

				MICHAEL
		It's him.  Fabrizzio.
			(almost to himself)
		Revenge is a dish that tastes best
		when it's cold.

				NERI
		How do you want me to handle it?

Michael glances at Hagen, who has been waiting in the room.

				MICHAEL
		Later.  Tom?

Hagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through
it:

				HAGEN
		I've cleared it through the
		Senator's chief aide, a man named
		Turnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy
		gambler, and into us for over a
		hundred grand, so I figure his
		information is reliable.

Neri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.

				HAGEN
		The Senator can be set up; but he
		thinks of himself as a clean
		politician.  So it's got to be on
		terms he can live with: campaign
		contribution, donation to a
		charitable cause that he controls,
		things like that.  If he gets even
		the inkling that you think you're
		buying him, he'll freeze up.
		Nevada's a funny state, they like
		things both ways here... All right.
		Turnbull says the Senator will be
		here at two-thirty, and he's been
		primed.  He knows you'll want to
		meet with him alone, and he knows
		it's about the Tropicana's license.
		At any rate, he expects to be
		introduced around to some of the
		influential people here today, and
		generally treated as an ordinary
		guest.  Just go light on him,
		Mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks
		don't like to think of themselves
		as crooks...

Michael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was
unnecessary.

				HAGEN
		I'm sorry; of course, you know that.

				MICHAEL
		Two-thirty.  That gives me time to
		see my boy.

				HAGEN
		Connie's outside.

Michael doesn't want to see her.

				HAGEN
		I promised; she said it was urgent.

Michael nods.

				MICHAEL
		All right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.

Neri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in
impatiently, followed by Merle.

				MICHAEL
		I said I would see my sister, alone.

				MERLE
		I think this concerns me too.
			(taking a cigarette
			from the dispenser)
		You don't, do you?

Connie steps forward, kisses Michael on the cheek.

				CONNIE
		How are you, honey?  You've met
		Merle, haven't you.  He was with me
		in Vegas.

				MICHAEL
		I saw him with you.

				CONNIE
		We're going to Europe next week.  I
		want to get passage booked on the
		Queen.

				MICHAEL
		Why do you come to me?  Why don't
		you go to a travel agent?

				MERLE
		We're going to get married first.

Michael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window
overlooking the lake.

				MICHAEL
		The ink on your divorce isn't dry.
		Your children see you on weekends;
		your oldest boy, Michael Francis...
		was in some trouble with the Reno
		police over some petty theft that
		you don't even know about.

				CONNIE
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		You fly around the world with lazy
		young men who don't have any love
		for you, and use you like a whore.

				CONNIE
		You're not my father!

				MICHAEL
		Then why do you come to me?

				CONNIE
		Because I need MONEY!

				MICHAEL
			(softly)
		Connie, I want to be reasonable
		with you.  You have a house here,
		with us.  You can live here with
		your kids...and you won't be
		deprived of anything.  I don't know
		much about Merle; I don't know what
		he does for a living; what he lives
		on.  Why don't you tell him marriage
		is really out of the question; and
		that you can't see him any more.
		He'll understand.  But if you
		disobey me, and marry this pimp...it
		would disappoint me.

				CONNIE
		It was my father's money; and I'm
		entitled to what I need.  Where is
		Tom Hagen?

She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face
with Merle.

				MICHAEL
		Are you finished?

				MERLE
		I think so.

				MICHAEL
		Then out.

Merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY

The orchestra has struck up a "Paul Jones," where two
concentric circles of young people march in opposite
directions, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever
is opposite them as their new dance partner.

VIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA

Francesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young
friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the
water skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path
leading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small
covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men
step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and
follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his
business.

CLOSE VIEW

Pentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having
some difficulty with the orchestra.

				PENTANGELI
		I can't believe that out of thirty
		professional musicians, not one of
		you is Italian!
			(as the musicians laugh)
		C'mon, give us a tarantella.

He waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano
starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet
starts to play "Pop Goes the Weasel," and soon the rest of
the orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for
approval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a
handful of canapes.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Rocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold
and wet of his boatride, to Michael.

The man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that
Neri should get him a drink.

				MICHAEL
		Rocco, his friends must be hungry.
		See what you can do, but I'd like
		to keep them away from the guests.

The older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his
bodyguards, and they follow Lampone.

				MICHAEL
		You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.
		Johnny Ola.

				OLA
		Sure, I remember Tom from the old
		days.

Tom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his
importance.

				MICHAEL
		Tom isn't going to sit in with us,
		Johnny.  He only handles specific
		areas of the family business.  Tom?

				HAGEN
		Sure, Mikey.

He gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain
silent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear
Tom doesn't want to be excluded.

				HAGEN
		If you need anything, just...

				MICHAEL
		Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.

Hagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes:

				OLA
		I just left our friend in Miami.

				MICHAEL
		How is his health?

				OLA
		Not good.

				MICHAEL
		Is there anything I can do; anything
		I can send?

				OLA
		He appreciates your concern,
		Michael, and your respect.

There's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco
quietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the
conversation.

				OLA
		The hotel's registered owners are
		one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney
		Barclay, both Beverly Hills
		attorneys.  In reality it's split
		between the Old Lakeville Road
		Group from Cleveland, and our
		friend in Miami.  He takes care of
		others outside the country, you
		know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman
		runs the store, and does all right,
		but I've been instructed to tell
		you, that if you move him out, our
		friend in Miami will go along with
		you.

				MICHAEL
		He's very kind, tell him it's
		appreciated.  I'm sure it will be
		profitable all the way around.

				OLA
		He always makes money for his
		partners.  One by one, our old
		friends are gone.  Death, natural
		or not, prison, deported.  Our
		friend in Miami is the only one
		left, because he always made money
		for his partners.

The door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white
Communion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later,
Kay appears, and takes the boy's hand.

				KAY
		Anthony, Daddy's busy.

				MICHAEL
			(rising)
		This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.
		John Ola of Miami.

				KAY
		I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator
		Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.
		Barrett wanted to thank you before
		they left.  Won't you join us, Mr.
		Ola?

				MICHAEL
		Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.
		Please tell the Senator I won't be
		a minute.

Pause; she stands there a moment.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		Kay.

				KAY
		Yes, Michael.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Kay closes the door.  It seems as though Michael has violated
some sort of promise to her by having this man here today.
She looks up toward the first boathouse.

WHAT SHE SEES:

The covered launch, and Ola's three bodyguards, eating while
they wait.

MED. VIEW

Anthony runs away from her, heading toward the house.

				KAY
		Anthony!
			(she runs after him)
		Anthony, where are you going?

Moodily, the boy stops, turns, and walks back to his table
of honor without answering her.

EXT. TAHOE TABLES AND PAVILION - VIEW ON THE PAVILION - DAY

The orchestra has taken its break; now two couples in formal
dress are performing the Quartet from Rigoletto.

VIEW ON HAGEN

sitting by himself, a little down, having a drink.  He's
waiting for Michael to re-summon him.  SANDRA, Sonny's
widow, sits opposite him.

				HAGEN
		Where's my wife?

				SANDRA
		With Mama, putting the baby to
		sleep.  Francesca's very happy.
		Michael was kind to her.  She
		idolizes him.
			(pause; she looks at
			a despondent Hagen)
		The children are all out in the
		speedboat.  I'm going to my house.

Sandra gets up, still an attractive woman, and walks alone
to the back path that leads to her home on the estate.

VIEW ON THE PAVILION

The returned orchestra strikes a big, show-biz chord,
intended to command the guests' attention.

The orchestra LEADER raises his hands for silence, and makes
an announcement over the P.A. system.

				MAESTRO
		Ladies and gentlemen, a most
		distinguished guest would like to
		say a few words: Senator and Mrs.
		Pat Geary of the state of Nevada!

A big hand, as the smiling SENATOR introduces his WIFE by
holding her arm up to the crowd, and then proceeds alone to
the bandstand.

MED. VIEW

Michael stands with Kay and Mrs. Geary.  The Senator's
presence seems to be a statement of political and social
status.

A little distance away, his beautiful son Anthony sits
quietly, in an unmistakably morose mood.

INT. TAHOE - SANDRA'S HOUSE - DAY

We HEAR the applause and whistles echoing in the distance.
Sandra stands in her bedroom, looking at the door.  We SEE a
photograph of SONNY, and also one of their wedding.

A moment goes by, and then Tom Hagen enters, closing the
door behind him.

We begin to HEAR Senator Geary's amplified voice resounding
over the lake.  Hagen moves to Sandra.  She takes him in her
arms, comforting, holding his head against her full breast.

				HAGEN
			(quietly)
		He doesn't want my help any more.
		He doesn't need it.

				SANDRA
		We don't know that's true, he never
		said that.

				HAGEN
		I can feel it in the way he talks
		to me.

He moves to the dresser; pours himself a drink.

				HAGEN
		Just now when Johnny Ola showed up,
		he asked me to leave them alone.
		Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian
		contact.  I was on the inside of
		ten, twenty meetings with him.  But
		today Mike asked me to leave, like
		an outsider.

				SANDRA
		Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.

				HAGEN
		It's as though he blames me for the
		ground the family lost when I was
		Consigliere to Sonny.

Sandra pulls Hagen to her, and kisses him passionately on
the mouth.

				HAGEN
		I love Michael, I want to help him,
		be close to him.  I don't want to
		end up a third string lawyer making
		property settlements for the hotels.

Sandra knows he needs her.  Slowly she begins to undress.

				SANDRA
		We have a little time now.

EXT. THE PAVILION - VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY - DAY

				SENATOR GEARY
		...my thanks, and the thanks of the
		young people of the State of
		Nevada, for this most impressive
		endowment...
			(he holds a check in
			his hand)
		...made to the University in the
		name of Anthony Vito Corleone.
		Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Michael
		Corleone.

Applause.  Senator Geary returns the microphone to the
Maestro who adds:

				MAESTRO
		And now, the Nevada Boys' Choir
		have prepared a special thank you
		for Mr. Michael Corleone.

He turns to a small Choir Master, who leads the Boys' Choir
in a choral arrangement of "MR. WONDERFUL."

VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY

shaking hands with Michael, as Press Photographers snap
pictures, showing the check; showing a special award of
Gratitude from the State; Mrs. Corleone and Mrs. Geary; all
together; Michael and his son; Senator Geary and Michael's
son; and on and on.  In the midst of this:

				SENATOR GEARY
		Where can we meet alone?

Michael indicates the boathouse a distance away, where Neri
seems to be waiting for them.  Then Michael leans to Rocco:

				MICHAEL
		Find Hagen.

Rocco sets off; as more pictures are taken, and the:

BOYS' CHOIR

sings its lovely arrangement of "Mr. Wonderful."

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael, the Senator, Neri and Rocco make a group in the
dark, large room.

				MICHAEL
		It was very kind of you to come to
		my home on this occasion, Senator.
		My wife has been very concerned
		with making a good impression on
		the people who are our neighbors,
		and your appearance here has made
		her very happy.  If I can ever
		perform a service for you, you only
		have to ask.

The door opens, and Hagen sheepishly makes his way in.

				MICHAEL
		My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged
		this all through your man Turnbull.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I thought we would meet alone.

				MICHAEL
		I trust these men with my life.
		They are my right arms; I cannot
		insult them by sending them away.

				SENATOR GEARY
			(taking out some medication)
		Some water.

He addresses that to Neri, who resentfully goes to fetch the
Senator a glass of water.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Alright, Corleone.  I'm going to be
		very frank with you.  Maybe more
		frank than any man in my position
		has ever spoken to you before.

Michael nods, indicating that he should do so.

				SENATOR GEARY
		The Corleone family controls two
		major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno.
		The licenses were grandfathered in,
		so you had no difficulties with the
		Gaming Commission.  But I have the
		idea from sources...
			(takes the water from
			Neri and swallows his pills)
		...that you're planning to move in
		on the Tropicana.  In another week
		or so you'll move Klingman out,
		which leaves you with only one
		technicality.  The license, which
		is now in Klingman's name.

				MICHAEL
		Turnbull is a good man.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Let's forget the bullshit, I don't
		want to stay here any longer than I
		have to.  You can have the license
		for two hundred and fifty thousand
		in cash, plus a monthly fee equal
		to five percent of the gross...

Michael is taken aback; he looks at Hagen.

				SENATOR GEARY
		...of all three Corleone hotels.

Hagen is frustrated; all his information was wrong.

				MICHAEL
		Senator Geary, I speak to you as a
		businessman who has made a large
		investment in your state.  I have
		made that state my home; plan to
		raise my children here.  The
		license fee from the Gambling
		Commission costs one thousand
		dollars; why would I ever consider
		paying more?

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone,
		because I don't like you; I don't
		like the kind of man you are.  I
		despise your masquerade, and the
		dishonest way you pose yourself and
		your fucking family.

VIEW ON HAGEN

glances at Michael.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

makes no outward reaction.

				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		We're all part of the same
		hypocrisy, Senator.  But never
		think it applies to my family.

				SENATOR GEARY
		All right, then let me say you'll
		pay me because it's in your
		interests to pay me.

VIEW ON GEARY

rising.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'll expect your answer, with
		payment, by tomorrow morning.  Only
		don't contact me...from now on,
		deal only through Turnbull.

He is almost out the door.

				MICHAEL
		Senator...
			(cold and calm)
		...you can have my answer now if
		you'd like.

Geary turns back.

				MICHAEL
		My offer is this.  Nothing...not
		even the thousand dollars for the
		Gaming Commission, which I'd
		appreciate if you would put up
		personally.

Geary returns Michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves.
Slowly Michael turns to Hagen.

VIEW ON HAGEN

embarrassed at being so off the mark.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right, Tom, we'll talk
		later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd
		like him to have dinner at my
		family table before we do business.

EXT. THE PAVILION - NIGHT

Now the light has faltered, and the young waiters have put
up the night lights.  The tables are all properly set for
dinner, with candles on each one.

The orchestra is playing quiet, unobtrusive dinner music,
and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the
impressive buffet, under a party tent.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a large table with Kay, his son Anthony,
Mama, Hagen and TERESA, Connie and Merle' Fredo and Deanna,
and Frankie Pentangeli.

				MAMA
		Cent' Anne.

This, the table of honor, all raise their glasses and repeat
the toast.

				DEANNA
		What's 'cent' Anne?'

				FREDO
		A hundred years...it's a toast.

				CONNIE
		It means we should all live happily
		for one hundred years.  The family.
		If my Father were alive, it'd be
		true.

				MAMA
		Connie.

				CONNIE
		Merle, have you met my sister-in-
		law Deanna?

				DEANNA
		What a pleasure, Merle.
			(shaking hands)


				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		Those two are perfect for each other.

				MERLE
		What's that mean?

				CONNIE
		Mama!

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		Michael, in all respect, I didn't
		come three thousand miles for dinner.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know.

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		When do we talk?

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		After dinner.

By now, the conversation has become exclusively Sicilian,
with Merle and Deanna, looking from side to side like in a
tennis match.  Finally, Kay, to be polite:

				KAY
		Anthony, you were talking to Mr.
		Pentangeli?

				ANTHONY
		His name is "Five-Angels."

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian.
		A one-way conversation!

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Pentangeli is angry; but because it is Michael he is talking
to, he keeps his voice low and represses his desire to shout.

				PENTANGELI
		Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart
		attack, but the Rosato Brothers
		gave it to him.

				MICHAEL
		We were all heartbroken at the
		news; but that wasn't cause to
		start a war.

				PENTANGELI
		Okay, now it's my family in
		Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up
		Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how
		can I run my family with you
		challenging my every move?  You're
		too far from the street, Mike, the
		only way to reason with the Rosato
		Brothers is to whack 'em and whack
		'em fast.

				MICHAEL
		You were unfair with them.

				PENTANGELI
		Says who?

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza promised Rosato three
		territories in the Bronx after he
		died, and then you took over and
		welched.

				PENTANGELI
		Clemenza promised them nothing, he
		hated the sonsuvbitches.

				MICHAEL
		They feel cheated.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, you're sitting up here in
		the Sierra Mountains with champagne
		cocktails making judgment on the
		way I run my family.

				MICHAEL
			(suddenly in Sicilian)
		Your family still carries the name
		Corleone, and you will run it like
		a Corleone!

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		And while I feed my family in New
		York, you put the knife in my back
		in Miami.

				MICHAEL
			(firm)
		Frankie, you're a good old man, and
		you've been loyal to my Father for
		years...so I hope you can explain
		what you mean.

				PENTANGELI
		The Rosatos are running crazy;
		taking hostages, spitting in my
		face, because they're backed by the
		Jew in Miami.

				MICHAEL
		I know.  That's why I want you to
		be fair with them.

				PENTANGELI
		How can you be fair with animals?
		They recruit niggers and spicks;
		they do violence in their own
		Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And
		everything is dope and whores; the
		gambling is left to last.  Let me
		run my family without you on my
		back.  I want them taken care of.

				MICHAEL
		No.  There are things that I have
		planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't
		want them disturbed.

				PENTANGELI
		You give your loyalty to a Jew over
		your own blood.

				MICHAEL
		Frankie, you know my father
		respected Roth, did business with
		him.

				PENTANGELI
		He did business...but he never
		trusted him.

Pentangeli takes his hat, and leaves.

				NERI
		Should he go?

				MICHAEL
		The old man had too much vino
		rosso, or he'd never talk openly
		that way.  Let him go back to New
		York; I've already made my plans.
			(he checks his watch)
		It's late; I've spent so little
		time at the party.

EXT. THE LAWNS AND TABLES - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

By now the sun has fallen and the lawns of the Corleone
estate are lit by moonlight.  Beautifully dressed couples
dance as the orchestra plays a foxtrot of the late fifties.

VIEW ON THE DANCE FLOOR

Deanna has been dancing with Fredo; she has gotten drunk and
it teasing her husband by flirting with other men on the
floor.

				DEANNA
		I wanta dance...whatsa matter with
		that?

				FREDO
		Dancing is alright; you're falling
		on the floor.

				DEANNA
		Whatsamatter, you don't want me to
		dance with him 'cause he's a man!

				FREDO
		Deanna, I'm going to belt you right
		in the mouth!

				DEANNA
		These Eye-ties are really crazy
		when it comes to their wives.

By now guests are starting to notice the disturbance;
Michael is with Kay, and some friends; Rocco catches his eye.

				DEANNA (O.S.)
		Jesus, never marry a WOP, they
		treat their wives like shit.

VIEW on Kay, listening, embarrassed by her flashy sister-in-
law.

VIEW ON FREDO AND DEANNA

Rocco passes by Fredo and whispers:

				ROCCO
		Freddie, Mike says take care of it,
		or I have to.

				DEANNA
		He's a friend of your brother!

Without another word, Rocco grabs firm hold of her and
whisks her out of the crowd.

				DEANNA
		"Shuffle off to Buffa...
		Shuffle off to Buffa...
		Shuffle off to Buffalooooo..."

Freddie mops his forehead, and moves to Michael.

				FREDO
		Hey Mike, what can I say?

				MICHAEL
		Forget it, just go take care of her.

EXT. DANCE FLOOR AND PAVILION - MOVING TWO SHOT - NIGHT

Kay and Michael dancing in the moonlight.

				MICHAEL
		How's the baby?

				KAY
		Sleeping inside me.

				MICHAEL
		Does it feel like a boy?

				KAY
		Yes, Michael, it does.

				MICHAEL
		I'm sorry about some of the people
		I had to see today.  It was bad
		timing... but it couldn't be helped.

				KAY
		It made me think of what you told
		me once.  In five years, the
		Corleone family will be completely
		legitimate.  That was seven years
		ago.

He has no answer for her; except that he loves and values
her, and holds her tight, as they dance amid their guests,
all dressed elegantly for the social event of the season.

The VIEW LOOSENS to show the entire, night-lit party.

Some quiet, informally dressed couples wait in the rear of
the chapel; some talking, others sitting nervously.

A single organ plays some standard wedding music.

The VIEW PANS up to the altar, where Connie and Merle, in
the same clothing they wore to the Tahoe party, are being
married by a Justice of the Peace.

The Justice goes through the bored, simple ceremony, and we
begin to HEAR an echo of the waltz Connie danced with her
father, when she was married all those years ago in Long
Island.

EXT. THE TROPICANA - LAS VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A dark car pulls up to the glitter of the neon facade.
Albert Neri, alone, leaves it to the parking valets, and
moves quickly through the automatic doors, into the main
casino.  We still hear the CORLEONE WALTZ.

INT. THE TROPICANA - DAY

Albert Neri enters the room; glances around a moment, and
then heads toward the crap table, where a short, middle-aged
man, KLINGMAN, stands by the pit boss.  Several security
guards of the casino, are at their posts.

				NERI
		Are you Klingman?

				KLINGMAN
		Who's asking?

				NERI
		Where can we talk?

				KLINGMAN
		Right here.

				NERI
		I represent the interests of the
		Corleone family.  We make the
		invitation to you to tie up your
		affairs and be out of the hotel by
		Monday morning.

				KLINGMAN
		Who do you think you're talking to?

				NERI
		You said you were Klingman.

				KLINGMAN
		You don't come in here, talk to an
		owner in Las Vegas like that.

				NERI
		You missed my point; you are no
		longer an owner.

				KLINGMAN
		Get out of my hotel.

Neri stands in front of him, smiling.

				KLINGMAN
		Boys, get him out of here.

Quickly, Neri moves toward Klingman, and slaps him hard
several times in the face, knocking off his glasses... Red-
faced, Klingman gets down on his knees to pick them up once,
again.  Glasses on, he looks to his guards.

WHAT HE SEES

They stand, motionless.

VIEW ON KLINGMAN

Humiliated, Klingman moves across the casino floor, past a

		Keep it going.

EXT. A STREET IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK - NIGHT

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - 1915 - NIGHT

VITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in
his hand, being led down the crowded aisle of this Italian
Vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled GENCO
ABBANDANDO, his friend in America.  This entire sequence is
played in Sicilian.

				GENCO
		Come on, you've got to see her!

VIEW ON THE STAGE

A tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets
are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance
or exit.

The hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's
left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country,
America.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

All poor, Italo-Americans.  Genco finds a few seats, and
leads Vito to them, stepping on a few shoes in the process.
They have barely come to their seats, when an excited Genco
nudges Vito, and points to the stage.  People shout that
they should sit down.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

There is a knock on the door, and a young girl enters,
delivering a letter to Peppino in his tenement in America.
The girl is pretty; and obviously the object of Genco's
affection.  The letter brings bad news.  Peppino's Mother is
dead.  He weeps, and sings the final song, which most of the
audience knows: SENZA MAMMA.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco is enthralled with the young actress.  The people in
the audience are singing along with Peppino.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

The actress, object of Genco's affection, makes a dramatic
exit.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco pulls on Vito's jacket, indicating that now that his
love is offstage, they should leave.  Vito rises with him,
and they make their way all the way down the aisle.

INT. BACKSTAGE THEATRE - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Genco hurrying down the backstage corridor, hoping to catch
a glimpse of the actress.  He is followed by Vito.  Suddenly,
Genco stops short.

GENCO'S VIEW

A heavy-set, fierce looking Italian wearing an expensive
light-colored suit and a cream colored fedora.  This is
FANUCCI.  He is discussing a business matter with the
theatre IMPRESARIO; a large, strong looking man, who is
sweating nonetheless.  He doesn't seem to be giving in to
Fanucci.  He holds a locked strongbox.

VIEW ON VITO

watching.  The two men argue in Italian.

MED. VIEW

The young ACTRESS crosses into the area, unaware of the
difficulties.  The impresario sees her, and frightened,
motions that she should keep away.

				IMPRESARIO
		Carla!

But Fanucci grabs her easily by her slender wrist, and with
lightning speed, produces a knife which he holds against her
cheek.  The impresario wrings his hands in agony.

				IMPRESARIO
			(Sicilian)
		No...please, not my daughter.

Whereupon he begins to unlock the box which holds the
receipts for the night's box-office.

VIEW ON GENCO AND VITO

hiding, watching.  At first, Genco is enraged, as though he
would rush up to help his enamorata.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The Black Hand.

Then he backs away.  Vito looks at him shocked and
disappointed in this cowardly behavior.  Genco shakes his
head, and points, as though to say that where Fanucci is
concerned, there is nothing to be done.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
			 (whispered)
		Let's get out of here.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

has released the girl.  Her father pulls her away from him,
and slaps her for no reason; then he pays Fanucci.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Because you protested, it will cost
		a hundred more.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

Genco and Vito; Genco leans against the wall, breathlessly,
as though he's had a near escape.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I know what you are thinking,
		Vitone, but you don't understand
		yet how things are.  Fanucci is of
		the Black Hand.  Everyone in the
		neighborhood pays him, even my
		father.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		He's an Italian?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		A pig of a Neaponitan.
			(spits)


				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why?  Why does he bother other
		Italians?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Because he knows them; he knows
		they have no one to protect them.
		Vitone?  What do you think of my
		angel?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Beautiful.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Beautiful.

				VITO
		For you, she is beautiful.  For me,
		there is only my wife!

				GENCO
		I know.  That's why I brought you
		with me!

Genco embraces his good friend, and they laughingly walk
down the alley.

The stage door opens, and Fanucci exits, a sinister figure
in white, moving down the alley just in front of them, into
the night.

The two friends hold their breath, until he disappears.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Vito moves through the street, carrying groceries that he is
to deliver.

It is cold, and so vendors are huddled around fires they
have lit in old cans and drums.

He turns up an alleyway, and then stops.

VIEW UP THE ALLEY

With great strength, Fanucci lifts one of them up into the
air and throws him down hard to the concrete; but another,
holding onto his back, manages to produce a switchblade
knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving
man, slits Fanucci's throat from one side to the other.

Fanucci groans like some great hurt animal.  Blood pours
from the deep, smile-like slit in his throat.

He throws the young man off his back.

VIEW ON VITO

stepping back in the alley.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He takes off his white fedora, and runs down the alley
toward Vito, catching the flowing blood in his hat.

The young attackers scurry off in various directions.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY STORE - DAY

A tiny shop featuring imported food: trays of cured meats,
prosciutto, copagole, mortadella lies on the counter covered
with netting to keep away the thousands of flies.

Olive oil is sold in bulk, as well as wine, cheese and bacala.

Genco works here for his father, and is busy slicing paper
thin prosciutto for a customer, by hand.  Vito works in the
back as a stock clerk.

Finished with his customer, Genco moves to his friend.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I bet you can't guess what happened?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		What?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped
		Fanucci today; slit his throat from
		ear to ear.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers.
		They wanted to scare him, that's
		all.  Make him look bad.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		In Sicily, when you attack a man,
		you had better finish him.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I wish they had.  He takes fifty
		dollars a week from my father's
		cash drawer.  But you can't kill a
		man like Fanucci.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Because he's what we say...
		"connected"... You wait, see what
		happens to those guys from Ninth

A customer enters; and Genco moves away to serve him.

recalling what he had seen and thought.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEYWAY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A young man, one of those who had tried to kill Fanucci,
runs down an alleyway, breathlessly.  Then he stops, and
looks behind himself.  Whoever was following him is gone.
He turns and walks ahead.  Then the mammoth, white-suited
figure of Fanucci leaps down before him from the fire-escape.
He grins at the young man, and then raises his neck, showing
the gruesome wound that marks his throat.

He takes out his pistol and fires point-blank at his attacker.

INT. TINY TENEMENT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The very small, railroad type flat where Vito lives with his
new family.

It is late at night, and he is exhausted.

He returns home; where his young wife, CARMELLA, goes
through the silent ritual of preparing a simple meal for him.
He sits and eats quietly.

INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Vito and Carmella enter the darkened bedroom, and approach a
metal crib.  Vito reaches down and takes the small hand of
the baby between his thick peasant fingers.  Carmella waits
a respectful distance behind him.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY - DAY

The shop bell RINGS; SINGER ABBANDANDO turns to see a
smiling Fanucci tipping his hat, like an old customer.

				FANUCCI
		Buon giorno.

Immediately, Vito turns back to his work, and Signor
Abbandando moves to Fanucci with a sigh.

Vito notices the two men talking quietly at one side of the
store, while he goes about his work.  Genco works his way
closer to his friend.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		What did I tell you.  The one who
		cut him was found in an alley.  And
		the family of the others paid
		Fanucci all their savings to make
		him forswear his vengeance.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (surprised)
		And he agreed?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		He took the money.  Now he wants
		double from everybody in the
		neighborhood, including Papa.

Vito watches the heated, but inevitable transaction.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (almost to himself)
		A real mafioso doesn't sell his
		vengeance.

MED. VIEW

Signor Abbandando seems to be arguing with Fanucci, and
every so often they turn and relate to where Vito is working.
Then Fanucci leaves, the little bell RINGING; and Signor
Abbandando reluctantly moves to Vito.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
			(Sicilian)
		Vitone.  How is your son?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		We are all well.

It is clear that he has something difficult to tell the
young man.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
		Vitone...I...Fanucci has a nephew.

Vito looks at him a while, as the old man struggles to tell
him.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		And you must give him my job.

The old man nods, regretfully.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		You have been kind to me since I
		was a boy; taken care of me, and
		been as a father.  I will always be
		grateful to you.  Thank you.

Vito takes off his apron, and leaves, passing the youth who
loiters by the counter.

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

making his way from the store.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
			(Sicilian o.s.)
		Vitone!

He turns, and Abbandando has followed him out of the shop,
holding a basket of some groceries.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
		Here...for your family.

				VITO
		No...please understand...I cannot
		accept.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito and his wife sit quietly at the table; the two are
quiet and sad.

Suddenly, we HEAR a noise, and Vito is astonished to see a
young man, PETER CLEMENZA, leaning out of the window on the
other side of the air shaft which separates their apartments.

				CLEMENZA
		Hey Paisan!  Hold this for me until
		I ask for it.  Hurry up!

Automatically Vito reaches over to the empty space at the
air shaft, and takes the bundle of rags.  Clemenza's round
face is strained and urgent, obviously in some kind of
trouble.  Suddenly, he closes the window and there is
activity that we cannot see in the other apartment.

Vito looks to his wife, and then closes the window and
window dressing and takes the bundle into a private part of
his kitchen and begins to unwrap it.

WHAT HE SEES:

Five oily guns.  He immediately wraps them again, and
carries them to a private closet, and hides it, and returns
to his wife.  He sits down back at the table; and she knows
not to ask him what has happened.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Vito is walking through the crowded streets with a group of
workmen; they all wear work clothes, and paper hats on their
heads.

Vito looks to his left, and realizes that Clemenza is
walking silently with him; by contrast, Clemenza dresses well.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (casually)
		Do you have my goods still?

Vito nods.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Did you look inside?

Vito, his face impassive, shakes his head 'no.'

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		I'm not interested in things that
		don't concern me.

INT. DOWNTOWN ITALIAN SOCIAL CLUB - DAY

Vito and Clemenza drinking wine; they've become friends.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		I have a friend who has a fine rug.
		Maybe your wife would like it.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		We have no money for a rug.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		No.  He would give it away.  I know
		how to repay a consideration.

Vito thinks, then nods.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		She would like it.

INT. HALLWAY WEALTHY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The two men proceed up the hallway; Vito is impressed with
the opulence.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Your friend lives in a fine building.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Oh yes, the very best.

Clemenza knocks on the door as though he is well known here;
then rings.  No answer.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Ah, he's not at home.  Oh, well, he
		wouldn't mind.

Quickly and expertly he takes out a tool and pries open the
door.

INT. WEALTHY APARTMENT - FULL VIEW - DAY

Vito looks in awe at the luxurious apartment, which features
a fabulous rich red wool rug.

Clemenza immediately moves some of the furniture away, and
drops to the floor.

				CLEMENZA
		A little help.

Vito joins him, and the two begin rolling the rug.  We HEAR
a BUZZER RING.  Clemenza immediately drops his side of the
roll, and moves to the window.  He pulls a gun from his
jacket.

VIEW ON Vito watching.  He moves so he can see out the window.

THEIR VIEW

A Policeman stands at the exterior door, waiting.  He rings
the buzzer again.

VIEW ON CLEMENZA

cocking his gun.  Vito realizes that if the Policeman should
pursue it any further he is a dead man.  The Policeman gives
up and leaves.

Clemenza puts away his gun.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

The two men run up the steps, laughing, carrying the fine rug.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY

They are on their knees cutting the rug to fit the small

EXT. DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Clemenza knocks on the steel door of this downtown building.
Vito waits with him, holding some packages; and another
youth, TESSIO, tall and thin and deadly waits with them.

The door is lifted, and they are greeted by a bright,
middle-aged Italian named AUGUSTINO who leads them into a
machine shop.

INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Good, you waited for us.

Clemenza looks up on a higher level.

HIS VIEW

There is a nine year old boy, operating a drill press.

MED. VIEW

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		Who is he?

				AUGUSTINO
			(Sicilian)
		My son, Carmine...it's all right.

The men then quickly open the packages they've brought;
revealing gun, including a more sophisticated machine weapon.

Augustino takes them and expertly begins to clean and
prepare them.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (to Vito)
		Paisan Augustino was a gunsmith in
		the Italian army.  We do each other
		favors.

				AUGUSTINO
			(Sicilian)
			 (while he works)
		My boy is studying the flute.  He
		plays very well.  He helps me at
		night so we can buy him a silver
		flute someday.  Now he has one made
		of wood.  Carmine...play...play for
		my friends.

VIEW ON THE BOY

wide-eyed... he shuts off the press; and takes out a shabby
wooden flute.  And begins to play a simple and pure melody.

The men listening, as the boy's father prepares their guns.

EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT

Tessio and Clemenza quickly load racks of cheap dresses.

Vito sits behind the wheel of the truck.  He seems reserved,
and we get the impression that he is studying every move his
two friends are making.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Clemenza runs up a flight of stairs with an armful of
dresses.  He knocks on a door, and a pretty HOUSEWIFE answers.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Lady, I got a bargain on these
		dresses.  Five dollars each.  You
		gotta pay at least fifteen, maybe
		twenty in a store.  Look at them,
		first class.

He holds the dresses up and the woman seems interested.  She
handles a couple of them and stands aside so Clemenza can
enter her apartment.

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		I don't know which one I like best.

She holds the dresses against her body, Clemenza approving
of each one; and then she goes to her purse and takes out
five singles and gives them to him.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		You'd look beautiful in all of
		these.  You should buy at least two.

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		Are you kidding?  My husband will
		kill me if he knows I paid five
		dollars for one dress.

She holds one up, then another.  She is torn.  Clemenza
shakes his head and straightens the dress on her body.  His
hand brushes her arm; she looks at him smiling.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		You can have two for five.

She smiles back.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

Clemenza jumps down the stairs, and out to the middle of the
street, where Vito and Tessio are waiting in the car with
some of the stock.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What took so long?

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		She couldn't decide.

Tessio and Clemenza each take more armsful of dresses and
divide the neighborhood.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Vito, take the rest of the stock
		over to Dandine's warehouse; he'll
		move it to a wholesaler.

The three part.  Vito drives the truck off.

MOVING VIEW

Vito drives the truck through the downtown streets; he turns
a corner and stops for a light.

Suddenly, to his left, he sees the formidable figure of
Fanucci.

He grabs young Corleone by the shoulder.

CLOSE VIEW ON FANUCCI

frightening, revealing the large circular scar, now healed.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Ahhh, young fellow.  People tell me
		you're rich, you and your two
		friends.  Yet, you don't show
		enough respect to send a few
		dresses to my home.  You know I
		have three daughters.

Vito says nothing.  Fanucci thumbs through the stock.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		This is my neighborhood.  You and
		your friends have to show me a
		little respect, ah?  This truck you
		hijacked was in my neighborhood.
		You should let me wet my beak a
		little.

Fanucci takes a few of the dresses.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I understand each of you cleared
		around six hundred dollars.  I
		expect two hundred dollars for my
		protection and I'll forget the
		insult.  After all, young people
		don't know the courtesies due a man
		like myself.

Vito smiles at him and nods.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Otherwise the police will come to
		see you and your wife and children
		will be dishonored and destitute.
		Of course, if my information as to
		your gains is incorrect, I'll dip
		my beak just a little.  Just a
		little, but no less than one
		hundred dollars, and don't try to
		deceive me, eh paisan?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		My two friends have my share of the
		money.  I'll have to speak to them
		after we deliver these to the
		wholesaler.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		You tell your friends I expect them
		to let me wet my beak in the same
		manner.  Don't be afraid to tell
		them.  Clemenza and I know each
		other well, he understands these
		things.  Let yourself be guided by
		him.  He has more experience in
		these matters.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (shrugging innocently)
		You must understand, this is all
		new to me...

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I understand...

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		But thank you for speaking to me as
		a Godfather.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
			 (impressed)
		You're a good fellow.

He takes Vito's hands and clasps them in his own.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		You have respect.  A fine thing in
		the young.  Next time, speak to me
		first, eh?  Perhaps I can help you
		make your plans.

Fanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms, waving
to Vito.

Vito throws the truck in gear, and drives off.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

We know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with
an icy rage.

INT. VITO'S APARTMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

He wife serves a dinner for her husband and his two friends.
They discuss Fanucci as they eat.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		Do you think he'd be satisfied with
		the two hundred dollars?  I think
		he would.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		That scar-faced bastard will find
		out what we got from the wholesaler.
		He won't take a dime less than
		three hundred dollars.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What if we don't pay?

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (gestures, it's hopeless)
		You know his friends...real animals.
		And his connections with the police.
		Sure he'd like us to tell him our
		plans so he can set us up for the
		cops and earn their gratitude.
		Then they would owe him a favor;
		that's how he operates.  We'll have
		to pay.  Three hundred, are we
		agreed?

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What can we do?

Clemenza doesn't even bother checking for Vito's opinion.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		They say Fanucci has a license from
		Maranzalla himself to work this
		neighborhood.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		If you like, why not give me fifty
		dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I
		guarantee he will accept that
		amount from me.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		When Fanucci says two hundred he
		means two hundred.  You can't talk
		with him.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I'll reason with him.  Leave
		everything in my hands.  I'll
		settle this problem to your
		satisfaction.

Tessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I never lie to people I've accepted
		as my friends.  Speak to Fanucci
		yourself tomorrow.  Let him ask you
		for the money, but don't pay it,
		and don't in any way quarrel with
		him.  Tell him you have to get the
		money and will send me as your
		messenger.  Let him understand that
		you're willing to pay what he asks,
		don't bargain.  I'll go to his
		house, and quarrel with him.  He
		likes me; enjoys explaining how
		things are here.  He uses ten
		sentences when he only needs one,
		so while he talks, I'll kill him.

Clemenza, irritated, makes a large belch, and washes his
food down with wine.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Vitone!
			(to Tessio)
		Our driver has drunk too much wine.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
			 (laughs at himself)
		He's going to kill Fanucci.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (stern)
		Then, after that, what?  Joe
		'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie
		Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla
		himself, c'mon!

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Fanucci is not connected; he is
		alone.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (sarcastically)
		What?  You read it in the papers?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		This man informs to the police;
		this man allows his vengeance to be
		bought off... No, he is alone.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		If you're wrong...

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		If I'm wrong, they will kill me.

Both Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young
friend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception
of the situation.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church
to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro.
People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of
the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to
the street.

MOVING VIEW

Clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along
the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and
sweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated
gesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a
church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and
slaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;
they embrace.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		All three daughters are at church;
		he is alone.  It's important that
		you let his neighbors see you leave.
		Tessio has broken the latch on the
		skylight of his building.

The wheel stops; they both lose.

				CLEMENZA
			(English)
		See, Brother Carmello, even the
		church makes numbers.

				PRIEST
			(English)
		It's only the way we collect that's
		different.

Vito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.

EXT. FESTA STREET - NIGHT

Vito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and
dark club.

INT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT

We can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa.  Vito
enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure
sitting alone at a small table.  Fanucci barely acknowledges
Vito as he joins him.

Without a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the
table.  Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it
on the table over the money.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I think there's only two hundred
		dollars under my hat.
			(he peeks)
		I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I'm a little short.  I've been out
		of work.  Let me owe you the money
		for a few weeks.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Ah, you're a sharp young fellow.
		How is it I've never noticed you
		before
			(he takes the two
			hundred and pours
			some wine for Vito)
		You're too quiet for your own
		interest.  I could find some work
		for you to do that would be very
		profitable.
			(he rises)
		No hard feelings, eh?  If I can
		ever do you a service let me know.
		You've done a good job for yourself
		tonight.

EXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

By now the musicians have left, but still families are
walking the street, and stopping at the booths.

Fanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and
considers himself highly loved.

Then Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way
home.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's
walk.

We HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a
glimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below.

EXT. FESTA STREETS - MOVING VIEW ON FANUCCI - NIGHT

walking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San
Gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony.

The VIEW LIFTS UP, to the rooftops.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Vito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then
crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the
building.

EXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT

The procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys;
and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried
out into the streets.

The priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in
the street kneel down in prayer.

INT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Fanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the
services in the background.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly
shut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with
it, but no luck.

From the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves
around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one;
it opens.

EXT. THE MONSTRANCE - MED. VIEW ON THE PRIEST - NIGHT

performing the services in Latin.  The ten altar boys are in
attendance.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly
oiled gun that has been left for him.  He slides down into
the building.

INT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT

Fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps.
An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately
moves to her apartment.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		What's the matter, Signora?  You
		don't say 'good evening'?

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

She quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs,
continues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is
always in evidence.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear
door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open
windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the
Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.

He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.

VIEW ON VITO

A slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside
to the alley where he can look into the apartment.

ANOTHER VIEW

Fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

He begins to wrap the gun.

VIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS

Their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious
gift he has bought for each.

CLOSE ON THE GUN

wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW
TILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all
or none of them.  Then something catches his eye.

WHAT HE SEES:

A small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes
up to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the
animal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its
confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's
apartment.

He steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian
shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of
the thumping footsteps of Fanucci.

VIEW ON VITO

holding the wrapped gun, waiting.

WHAT HE SEES:

The white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in
Italian as he throws the cat out.

VIEW ON VITO

squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST
resounding in the building.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying
to reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn
the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun
is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront
of his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into
this vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.

Fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a
terrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside
the apartment.

Vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,
quickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.
Now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,
literally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the
ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the
conclusion of the Mass down below.

CLOSE ON VITO

Pausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and
candles on the streets below.

He empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against
the side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and
breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney.
He smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and
handle, two separate pieces.

He then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate
fragments into various air shafts.

EXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

The Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the
Monstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir
sings.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito is a dark figure, moving with agility across the
rooftops.

INT. FANUCCI'S VESTIBULE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

EXT. CORLEONE TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit
happily on the front stoop of their tenement.  Some of the
men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR
the music and night sounds of the Festa.

A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.

Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance
from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of
wine, and listens to the song.

hand of his son.

INT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT

The room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.
We can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built
along the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone
enter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony
lies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his
small hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,
Anthony turns, his eyes open.  He is staring, perfectly
awake, at his father.

				MICHAEL
		Can't you sleep?

No answer.

				MICHAEL
		Are you alright?

				ANTHONY
		Yes.

				MICHAEL
		Did you like your party?

				ANTHONY
		I got lots of presents.

				MICHAEL
		Do you like them?

				ANTHONY
		I didn't know the people who gave
		them to me.

				MICHAEL
		They were friends.

He kisses his boy, and then turns.

				ANTHONY
		Did you see my present for you?

				MICHAEL
		No, where is it?

				ANTHONY
		On your pillow.

				MICHAEL
		I'm leaving very early tomorrow,
		before you wake up.

				ANTHONY
		I know.  How long will you be gone?

				MICHAEL
		Just a few days.

				ANTHONY
		Will you take me?

				MICHAEL
		I can't.

				ANTHONY
		Why do you have to go?

				MICHAEL
		To do business.

				ANTHONY
		I can help you.

				MICHAEL
		Some day you will.

Michael kisses him again.

INT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of
the large bed.

Kay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door
to his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down
to the pillow.

VIEW ON THE PILLOW

is a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a
hat sitting in the back seat.

An arrow pointing to him is marked "DAD." Under it, a nine
year old's handwriting says: "Do you like it?  Check YES __
I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it." Michael turns,
looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he
places a check next to "YES."

He starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay
turns, almost in her sleep:

				KAY
		Michael?  Why are the drapes open?

His eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows
of the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a
second's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding
his son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep
across the windows; glass shattering all over the room.

Kay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls
toward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.

Then, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the
shouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as
guards with flashlights come running.

Michael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,
and then gently:

				MICHAEL
		Go with the kids.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT

Suddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns
in an intense blue light.

Groups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all
directions; a state of confusion prevails.  There is no sign
of the attackers.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Michael is joined by Rocco Lampone, his gun drawn.

				ROCCO
		They're still on the property.
		Maybe you better stay inside.

				MICHAEL
		Keep them alive.

Six men take up posts by Michael's house.

				ROCCO
		We'll try.

				MICHAEL
		It's important.

He returns inside.

EXT. MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT

The character of the summer estate has changed: bright
floodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main
gate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the
estate on all sides.

Several men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main
gate.

FULL VIEW

Off in the distance, we see another group of men with
flashlights combing the waterline.  We hear indistinguishable
shouts.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

The wire gates are opened, and the trained dogs go out
yelping into the outer edge of the estate.

ROOFTOP

One of Rocco's men turns the large floodlight scanning
darkened forest areas, where men could hide.

MOVING VIEW

Men with flashlights and dogs.  Moving through the dark areas.

LOOSE VIEW

A small Corleone launch, with a bright spotlight slowly
cruises the boundaries of the estate.  We SEE the silhouette
of men with guns, quietly waiting and watching.

EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Some of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of Michael's
bedroom.

The curtains are drawn from inside.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kay, the children, and some women servants have come down
from the various rooms into the central living area, that
can be most easily secured.  The little girl is still
asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with
their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a
central room.

Michael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:

				MICHAEL
		It will be all right.  We were lucky.

She says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels
over the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She
holds her young daughter in her arms.

The door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is
holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and
puts it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance
away from Kay.

				ROCCO
		Your family all seem to be okay in
		the other houses; your Mother's
		still sleeping.

				MICHAEL
		And?

				ROCCO
		No sign of them yet; but they're
		still on the Estate.

We HEAR loud shouting from outside.

				DEANNA (O.S.)
		Goddamn you!  You're all nuts here,
		I'm not goin' to calm down...

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Through the door, that Rocco opens.

Deanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the
gunshots; while Fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back
into the house.

				FREDO
		Deanna, will you get back into the
		house!

				DEANNA
		I'm getting out of here I said;
		these guys all have guns!

				MICHAEL
		Fredo, can't you shut that woman up!
			(to Rocco's men)
		Get her in here!

The bodyguards, gracefully help Fredo bring the hysterical
Deanna into the safety of the house.

				DEANNA
			(whimpering)
		I don't want to stay here...

				FREDO
		Mike, what can I do, she's a
		hysterical woman...

				KAY
		Leave her alone!  You're talking as
		though she has no right to be
		frightened when there are machine
		guns going off in her backyard.

				MICHAEL
			(to Rocco)
		Have Tom Hagen meet me in the
		Harbor House.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Michael walks the short distance from his house, to the
boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.

A small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the
walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.
It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his
compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.

The boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily
wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure
where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of
emergency.

FULL VIEW

In the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with
their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the
estate.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT

Michael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in
safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.
He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;
there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been
asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down, Tom.

EXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

From outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits
down; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about
something very serious.

The patrol securing the boathouse, walk past the window.
Michael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the
drapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Michael talks intimately to Tom.

				MICHAEL
		There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
		I know that's upset you in the
		past; and you've felt that it was
		because of some lack of trust or
		confidence.  But it is because I do
		trust you that I've kept so much
		secret from you.  It's precisely
		that at this moment, you are the
		only one that I can completely
		trust.  In time, you'll understand
		everything.

				HAGEN
			(nods with this statement)
		But your people... Neri... Rocco;
		you don't think...

				MICHAEL
		No, I have confidence in their
		loyalty... but this is life and
		death, and Tom, you are my brother.

Hagen in very moved.

				HAGEN
		Mikey, I hoped...

				MICHAEL
		No Tom, just listen.  All my people
		are businessmen; their loyalty is
		based on that.  One thing I learned
		from my father is to try to think
		as the people around you think...and
		on that basis, anything is possible.
		Fredo has a good heart, but he is
		weak...and stupid, and stupid
		people are the most dangerous of
		all.  I've kept you out of things,
		Tom, because I've always known that
		your instincts were legitimate, and
		I wanted you to know very little of
		things that would make you an
		accomplice, for your own protection.
		I never blamed you for the setbacks
		the family took under Sonny; I know
		you were in a position of limited
		power, and you did your best to
		advise and caution him.  What I am
		saying is that now, for how long I
		do not know, you will be the Don.
		If what I think has happened is
		true; I will leave tonight, and
		absolutely no one will know how to
		contact me.  And even you are not
		to try to reach me unless it is
		absolutely necessary.  I give you
		complete power: over Neri... Fredo,
		everyone.  I am trusting you with
		the lives of my wife and children,
		and the future of this family,
		solely resting on your judgment and
		talent.

VIEW ON HAGEN

A man who has steadily declined over the last five years,
realizing that total power and responsibility is being
placed on him.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...But Tom, you must know that I do
		this only because I believe you are
		the only one who is capable of
		taking over for me.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

taking out the envelope.

				MICHAEL
		I've prepared this; have had it for
		over a month.  It won't explain
		everything; but indicates where I
		will be, so in a sense, it is my
		life.
			(he hands the envelope
			to Hagen)
		Also, there are three tasks that
		must be executed immediately.  Pop
		would have given those to Luca --
		You knew Pop as well as anyone, act
		as though you were him.  It
		discusses Kay as well; that will be
		the most difficult.  The men who
		tried to kill me tonight, will
		never leave the estate.

				HAGEN
		Will we...be able to get who
		ordered it out of them?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  Unless I'm very
		wrong...they're already dead.
		Killed by someone inside...very
		frightened that they botched it.
		That's why I am going to disappear
		in a few minutes, and leave
		everything to you.

				HAGEN
		But if you're wrong...

				MICHAEL
		If I'm wrong...

There is a KNOCK on the door.

				MICHAEL
		...I don't think I'm wrong.
			(he indicates the knock)
		Yes.

The door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a
knowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a
frightened and agitated Rocco.

EXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

A group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom
and Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs
through the estate.

LOW CLOSE VIEW

Michael's dispassionate face, looking down.  THE VIEW MOVES
to Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the
bridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in
the moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their
throats cut.  Light from the many flashlights illuminates
the grotesque scene.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Fish them out.

Several of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps,
and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they
were.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of
guns they used.

When they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone.
Everyone notices it, but no one says anything.

Hagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given
him in his hand.

He realizes that now, he is the DON.

				HAGEN
		Get rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow
		morning I want a report made to the
		local police, and paper, that some
		explosives we keep on the property
		were accidentally ignited.

The men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the
lighted section of the compound, which now resembles a
prison camp.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. STATE SENATE FLOOR - DAY

The Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor
during a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.

INT. GEARY'S OFFICE - DAY

The Senator steps behind his desk.

				SENATOR GEARY
		All right, Mr. Hagen, you've got
		ten minutes.

He flicks the switch of a small tape recorder.

				SENATOR GEARY
		...and the tape will be running.

				HAGEN
		Actually, I've come with good news;
		the Corleone family has done you a
		favor.

The Senator immediately shuts the tape recorder off.

				SENATOR GEARY
		What the hell are you talking about?

				HAGEN
		We know you're a busy man, with
		plenty of enemies -- we saw the
		opportunity to do you a favor, and
		we did.  No strings.

				SENATOR GEARY
		No strings.

				HAGEN
		You know there's a Senate
		Investigating Committee recently
		set up; we thought it would be
		unfortunate if they were to trace
		anything though-provoking to your
		name.

				SENATOR GEARY
		No one can trace anything to me; I
		pride myself on that.

				HAGEN
		Do you gamble?

				SENATOR GEARY
		A little; what's so thought-
		provoking about that?

				HAGEN
		Do you owe markers?

				SENATOR GEARY
		Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

Hagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the
Senator's desk.

				HAGEN
		The Corleone family has paid them
		off for you...as an expression of
		our esteem.

Geary quickly looks through the paid markers.

				SENATOR GEARY
		There's thirty grand worth of paid
		off markers -- I never owed that
		much.

				HAGEN
		Our mistake.  But what does it
		matter; it was our money.
			(rising)
		We don't even expect thanks.

				SENATOR GEARY
		You paid off thirty grand I never
		owed.

				HAGEN
		We'll keep it quiet; the people who
		know are trustworthy...the Committee
		needn't find out.

				SENATOR GEARY
		And what's the price of their not
		finding out.

				HAGEN
		Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not
		hostile.

				SENATOR GEARY
			(he despises Hagen)
		Thanks...friend.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - FULL VIEW - DAY

There are more men on duty than usual; not that there are
guns apparent, but it's clear that the boundaries are being
patrolled.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Kay exits her house, followed by her children; she helps
them into her station wagon like any housewife, and drives
along the path leading to the main gate.

She's about to drive through, when one of the men steps in
front of her, raising his hand.

				KAY
			(graciously)
		Yes.

				MAN
		I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're
		not to let you through.

				KAY
			(disbelieving)
		I'm going to the market.

				MAN
		If you could just give us a list,
		we'll pick up anything you want.

				KAY
		Whose orders are these?

				MAN
		Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

We notice Hagen walking to them in the background.

				HAGEN
		Kay.

VIEW THROUGH THE GATE

Hagen approaches the car; Kay gets out so they can talk away
from the children.

				HAGEN
		I wanted to explain this myself...
		I had business in Carson City.

He walks with her a little way from the others; the children
run out of the station wagon, and start to play.

				HAGEN
		It's Michael's request...for your
		safety.  We can send out for
		anything you need.

				KAY
		I'm supposed to stay in my house.

				HAGEN
		Within the compound will be fine.

				KAY
		I was supposed to take the children
		to New England next week.

				HAGEN
		That's off now.

				KAY
		I'm going to see my parents.

				HAGEN
		Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;
		and what he did tell me, I can't
		repeat.  But the responsibility for
		you and the kids was the most
		important thing he left me with.

				KAY
		How long does this go on?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry, Kay...

				KAY
		Am I a prisoner?

				HAGEN
		That's not the way we look at it.

Angrily, without another word, Kay turns away from him, and
walks to her children, ignoring the running station wagon.

EXT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - DAY

The luxury liner making its way across the Atlantic.

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - MED. VIEW - DAY

The PURSER followed by several white uniformed associates
knocks on the door of something designated the "Leonardo
Suite." He is holding a telegram.

The door opens, and a tanned Merle peeks out of the door.

				PURSER
			(holding up the telegram)
		I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
		but we have received two telegrams.

				MERLE
			(reluctantly)
		Well...come in.

This entourage enters the suite, an impressive and
beautifully spacious luxury suite.  Connie is relaxing.

				CONNIE
		What is it?

				PURSER
		Yes.  One is from our office in New
		York.  The check that you wrote for
		your passage has been returned.

				CONNIE
		Can't be...

				MERLE
		Why don't you wire your bank?

				PURSER
		The other telegram is from your
		bank.  Your account has been closed
		and the company is warned not to
		extend any credit.

				CONNIE
		I'll take care of it in Naples.

				PURSER
		The company hopes so.  But for now,
		we have orders to change your
		accommodations.

And with that, the men in white begin to pack Connie and
Merle's luggage.

				CONNIE
		That son of a bitch!

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - TINY THIRD CLASS CABIN - NIGHT

Connie and Merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature
cabin in bunk beds.  The little space is crowded with their
trunks and luggage.  Merle can barely hang onto the bunk,
the boat pitches so violently below.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A train speeds across the countryside.

INT. THE TRAIN - DAY

Inside the corridor, a porter advances, and knocks on the
door of a stateroom.  A voice tells him to enter.  OUR VIEW
enters with him as he carries a tray of lunch.  From this
POV we see Michael Corleone sitting in the compartment.

				PORTER
		Mr. Paul?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				PORTER
		You ordered lunch?

				MICHAEL
		Put it right there.

The porter does so; as he places the tray down, he catches a
glimpse of a second person in the compartment with Michael.

HIS VIEW

A very fierce, almost maniacal looking man, BUSSETTA.  He
nods that the porter should leave.

				MICHAEL
		Thank you.

The porter takes his advice and leaves quickly, closing the
door behind him.

VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW

Michael and his mysterious companion have lunch together on
the moving train.

EXT. GULFSTREAM RACE TRACK IN MIAMI - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY

The empty parking lot of the Gulfstream track, on an off-
race day.

CLOSER VIEW

Michael sits behind the wheel of a nondescript late model
car.  Bussetta sits in the rear.

Another car swings into the lot.  Michael starts his car,
and pulls out of the lot; the second car following.

NEW VIEW

This car pulls out and begins to follow them.  Michael
glances back by adjusting the rear view mirror, and nods to
Bussetta.

Michael's car begins to slow down, allowing the other car to
overtake them.

The overtaking car hesitates a moment, moving side by side
with them.

Michael glances toward the driver.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

We recognize Johnny Ola, who waves a greeting to Michael,
and then continues on to lead him.

EXT. SUBURBAN MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ola's car leads Michael's through a middle-class suburban
area of $30,000 to $40,000 homes.  There are small channels
with sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses.
Ola's car pulls up in front of a very simple, tract-type
home.  Michael's car parks nearby.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
			 (to Bussetta)
		You'll wait in the car.

Ola has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path
to the front door.  Michael waits.

Ola rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty,
middle-aged WOMAN answers, remaining behind the screen door.
Ola says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the
door open.

Ola comes down the steps, looks at Michael, nodding to him.
Ola then gets into his car and drives off.  Michael walks up
the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door
behind him.

This woman, TERRI ROTH, is in the kitchen, looking out at
Michael.

				TERRI
		I'm just going to make lunch.  How
		about a tuna fish sandwich?

				MICHAEL
		Thank you, Mrs. Roth.

She hurries halfway up the staircase.

				TERRI
		Hyman...HYMAN, your friend is here.
			(turning to Michael)
		Why don't you go right upstairs, Mr.
		Paul?

				MICHAEL
		Fine.

He continues upstairs; she goes into the kitchen.

				TERRI
		I'll give a yell when lunch is ready.

Michael continues up to a small den on the second floor; we
can HEAR the sound of a baseball game coming over the
television.

INT. HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY

Michael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat
like a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

There, sitting before the television is a small man in his
middle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a
small-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.

				ROTH
		Sit down, this is almost over.  You
		follow the baseball games?

				MICHAEL
		Not for a few years.

				ROTH
		I like sporting events -- I really
		enjoy watching them in the afternoon.
		One of the things I love about this
		country.  I loved baseball ever
		since Arnold Rothstein fixed the
		World Series of 1919...I heard you
		had some trouble.

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				ROTH
		What a mistake; people behaving
		like that, with guns.
			(he shakes his head)
		It was my understanding we left all
		that behind.  But, let me tell you,
		the important thing is that you're
		all right.  Good health is the most
		important thing; more than success;
		more than power; more than money.

				MICHAEL
		The incident of the other night is
		a nuisance that I can take care of.
		I came to you because I want
		nothing to affect our agreement; I
		wanted to clear everything I'm
		going to do with you, just in case.

				ROTH
		You're a considerate young man.

				MICHAEL
		You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I
		have much to learn from you.

				ROTH
			(warmly)
		However I can help you...

				MICHAEL
		The Rosato Brothers have performed
		services for you in the past; I
		understand that they are under your
		protection.

				ROTH
			(simply)
		We do favors for each other...

				MICHAEL
		Technically, they are still under
		the Clemenza wing of the Corleone
		Family, now run by Frankie
		Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died,
		the Rosatos wanted territory of
		their own.  Pentangeli refused, and
		came to me, asking for permission
		to eliminate them.  I, of course,
		knew of their relationship with
		you, and in gratitude for your help
		with the Tropicana matter, turned
		him down.  Pentangeli was furious,
		and paid one hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars to have me killed.
		I was lucky and he was stupid.
		I'll visit him soon.
			(leaning toward the
			old man, sincerely)
		The important thing is that nothing
		jeopardize our plans, yours and
		mine.  This thing of ours, that we
		will build.

The old man touches Michael's hand, warmly.

				ROTH
		Nothing is more important.

				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		Pentangeli is a dead man; do you
		object?

				ROTH
		It's always bad for business; but
		you have no choice.

				MICHAEL
		Then it's done.  I must choose his
		replacement: it cannot be Rosato.

				ROTH
		Of course you must keep control of
		your family.

He turns to Michael, turning the volume higher on the
television, and moving closer to his young partner.

				ROTH
		Michael, these things are
		unimportant.  Who should be the
		manager of a dime store, Joe or
		Jack?  Unimportant.  You do what
		you think is right.  You're a young
		man, and I'm old and sick.  What we
		do together in the next few months
		will be history, Michael; it has
		never been done before.  We will do
		this historical thing together, and
		even your Father could never dream
		it would be possible.  We are
		bigger than U.S. Steel, you and
		me... because in America, anything
		is possible!
			(pause)
		But soon I will be dead, and it
		will all belong to you.

There is a KNOCK on the door, and Terri Roth pushes the door
open with her hip.

				TERRI
		My goodness, you'll rupture your
		eardrums, Hyman.

She puts the tray down, and turns down the television.

EXT. ROTH'S HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

The sinister Bussetta waits patiently in the rear seat of
the car, outside Roth's modest house.

EXT. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - MOVING VIEW - DAY

A black Cadillac moves down the street, slowed by the
Festivities of the Festa that is in progress: people milling
around, buying souvenirs at the many stands set up.

Sausage and grilled meats are prepared, just as they were
years ago.  Electric lights are strung from the street
lamps, and brightly colored banners pronounce the "Festa of
the Madonna."

MOVING CLOSE VIEW

Willy Cicci drives, frustrated that he cannot go any faster.
Next to him, Frankie Pentangeli sits, catching a few seconds'
snooze.

MED. VIEW

The black car pulls up; another car that had been following
it parks nearby.

One of Pentangeli's button men gets out of the car, and
steps into a small Italian restaurant; he exits quickly, and
nods affirmatively toward Pentangeli's Cadillac.

The group of them step out quickly, men huddled around
Pentangeli, and enter the restaurant.

INT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

The restaurant is quite empty, despite the excitement out on
the street.

Pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall, dark,
snappily dressed young man, CARMINE ROSATO.

Nearby, on the other side of the room is Rosato's brother,
TONY, seated with a group of their men.

At another table in the restaurant is a table of Pentangeli's
people: they are joined by bodyguards.

				PENTANGELI
		Rosato, where's your brother?

				ROSATO
		Sitting right behind you.

Pentangeli glances behind himself.

				PENTANGELI
		He don't want to talk?

				ROSATO
		We worked it all out beforehand.

				PENTANGELI
		Are we going to eat or what?

				ROSATO
		Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.

				PENTANGELI
			(sarcastically)
		Forget it; I'm suddenly without an
		appetite.  You're making big
		trouble, Carmine.

				ROSATO
		You weren't straight with us,
		Frankie, what else could we do?

				PENTANGELI
		We could have talked first, saved a
		lot of running around.

				ROSATO
		You wasn't listening, you didn't
		want to talk.

				PENTANGELI
		Don't I look like I'm listening?

				ROSATO
		We want Brooklyn one hundred
		percent.  No more taxes to you.  We
		want to be only loosely connected
		with your family -- sort of a
		under-family all of our own.  Then
		we can act on all internal matters
		without talking.  Also we want you
		to inform Michael Corleone that we
		can deal directly with him.

				PENTANGELI
		I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll
		order something.  Joe.
			(one of his men)
		Get me some bracciole or something.
		And pay cash.
			(to Rosato)
		And in return for these concessions,
		what do you do for me?

				ROSATO
		We will release the hostages,
		number one.  Number two, we're here
		for you to count on when you need
		us.  We're independent, but we're
		here if you need us.  In general,
		we'll cooperate with you and your
		businesses, and you in turn will
		cooperate with us.  Pari persu.

				PENTANGELI
		Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari
		persu...?

				ROSATO
		My lawyer went over this beforehand.

				PENTANGELI
		What assurances do I have that
		there will be no more kidnapping,
		no more hits?

				ROSATO
		The same assurance we got from you.

				PENTANGELI
		What if I say shove it?

				ROSATO
		Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue
		DeRosa will need to be fitted for
		slabs.

				PENTANGELI
		You want a war?

				ROSATO
		We got no choice.

				PENTANGELI
		You know if there's a way I'll go
		to the commission and the commission
		will side with me.  That puts me
		and the other New York families
		against you.

				ROSATO
		We got friends in the commission.

				PENTANGELI
			(getting angry)
		I'm talking about Italians!

				ROSATO
		What about Michael Corleone?

				PENTANGELI
		He supports me.

				ROSATO
		Maybe, yes... maybe no.

One of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian
food.

Pentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he
pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's
hands.

				PENTANGELI
		You drove old Pete Clemenza to his
		grave, Carmine; you and your
		brother.  Turning on him; trouble
		in his territories -- you and your
		demands.  I hold you responsible,
		just as though you shot him in the
		head.  And I ain't gonna let that
		go for long!

Pentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little
tension between the bodyguards of the two factions.

				ROSATO (O.S.)
		Hey, Five-Angels...

He gives him the arm.

Frankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here
and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make
their move out.

EXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

Pentangeli gets into the car.

				PENTANGELI
		Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels
		to my face!

He slams the door.

EXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY

Part of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall
has been torn down, and the other houses sold off.

His car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over
the confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices
something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard
his house.  No one seems to want to tell him.

				PENTANGELI
		What's up?

Pentangeli glances over to the front door foyer.

PENTANGELI'S VIEW

The strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always
travels with Michael.

INT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY

Pentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the
hallway.

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		What's this?

				WIFE
		Michael Corleone.

				PENTANGELI
		One Michael Corleone...Dove?

				WIFE
			(Sicilian)
		He's in your study.

He knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in
his home.

He automatically moves into his study.

INT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY

Michael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his
father's study, although it is totally redecorated.
Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don,
and kisses his hand.

				PENTANGELI
		Don Corleone, I wish you let me
		know you was coming.  We could have
		prepared something for you.

				MICHAEL
		I didn't want you to know I was
		coming.  You heard what happened in
		my home?

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

				MICHAEL
			(furious)
		In my home!  In the same room where
		my wife was sleeping; where my
		children come in their pajamas, and
		play with their toys.

He's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as
suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me take my
		revenge.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, anything.  What is it I
		can do for you?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle these troubles
		with the Rosato Brothers.

				PENTANGELI
		I was just going to contact you,
		Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' -
		in fact, I just come from there.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle on their terms.

				PENTANGELI
		Mike, I don't understand.  Don't
		ask me to do that.

				MICHAEL
		Trust me; do as I ask.

				PENTANGELI
		It would be the beginning of the
		end for my family.  How can I keep
		all my other territories in like if
		I let two wise-guys stand up and
		demand this and that, and then give
		it to them?

				MICHAEL
		Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I
		have your loyalty?

				PENTANGELI
		Always... But sometimes I don't
		understand.  I know I'll never have
		your kind of brains, in big deals.
		But Mike, this is a street thing.
		And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind
		the Rosato Brothers.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				PENTANGELI
		Then why do you want me to lay down
		to them?

				MICHAEL
			(coldly, but convincing)
		Frankie, Roth tried to have me
		killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I
		don't know yet why.

				PENTANGELI
		Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's
		hit 'em now, while we still got the
		muscle.

				MICHAEL
		This was my father's old study.
		When I was a kid, we had to be
		quiet when we played near here.
		When I was older, I learned many
		things from him here.  I was happy
		that this house never went to
		strangers; first Clemenza took it
		over, and then you.  My father
		taught me, in this room, never to
		act until you know everything
		that's behind things.  Never.  If
		Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
		with you in the Rosato Brothers'
		favor, he'll think his relationship
		with me is still sound.  I'm going
		somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We
		have friends in some very important
		business that we're making.  Do
		this for me; you make the peace
		with the Rosato Brothers on their
		terms.  Let the word out that I
		forced you; you're not happy wit
		hit, but acquiesced, just because
		of me.  It will get back to Hyman
		Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can
		trust me.

				PENTANGELI
		Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.

				MICHAEL
		Good.

They embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young
Don, thoughtfully.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

The money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming
tables, and put on a cart with others.

The cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then
wheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room.

INT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY

The guards leave the room; the door is locked after them,
leaving only Hagen.  Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man.
The numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are
spread out on the counting table.

The accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count
and divide the money.

				NERI
		Fifteen percent skim?

				HAGEN
		Twenty-five this time.

The accountant stops, and looks up to Neri.

				NERI
		It might show.

				HAGEN
		Mike wants it.

Neri nods, and the accountant continues.  Neri opens a door,
allowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room.  The
cream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri.

				NERI
		We've never sent this much with one
		courier.

				HAGEN
			(to the courier)
		Your plans are a little different
		this time.  You skip Miami, and go
		straight to Geneva.  It's to be
		deposited to this number.
			(handing him a small envelope)
		And it's got to be there by Monday
		morning, no slip-up.

				COURIER
		I think I was 'picked-up' last trip.
		That hour layover I had at Kennedy.
		I went over and bought a paper...

Neri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.

				NERI
		Those were our people.

				COURIER
		Okay, just thought you should know.

He is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen
gestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of
carefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks
it, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking
inquiringly at Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Let them count.

The courier is shown out through a private door, and then
the first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the
guards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process
is begun all over again, this time with the State Tally
sheets.

INT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY

The courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri.

				NERI
		What's up?

				HAGEN
		No questions.

				NERI
		I got to ask questions, Tom,
		there's three million dollars cash
		in that pouch; Mike is gone and I
		have no word from him.

				HAGEN
		Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm
		the Don.

				NERI
		How do I know you haven't gone into
		business for yourself?

This hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he
owes Neri some explanation.

				HAGEN
		You've been through a lot with us
		so I'm going to give you the truth.
		Mike knows it was someone within
		the compound that set him up for
		that hit.  So nobody is to know
		where he is, not you, not Rocco,
		not even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,
		Al, I know how you feel about
		Mike...but he still remembers Tessio.

EXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT

Michael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is
followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped
onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast
off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

A seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor;
Hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase.
He continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed
in summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men
rather than thugs.

His wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with
her youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.

				THERESA
		Hungry?

				HAGEN
		Just a little.

				THERESA
		I've invited Mama, Sandra and the
		kids for barbecue.

				HAGEN
		What about Kay?

				THERESA
		I couldn't find her.  She's been so
		broody, sticks to herself.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Hagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the
lawn; the littler kids running after them.

Coals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and
several tables are set for the family.

In the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards.

Theresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks.

Hagen relaxes in a sports shirt.

				HAGEN
		Let me try Kay.

He crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael
and his family live.  Is about to knock on the door:

				HAGEN'S SON
		Hey, Pop, heads up!

The football is flying in his direction; he catches it and
throws it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

				HAGEN
		Kay?

He steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but
empty.

				HAGEN
		Anyone hungry?

He moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and
recreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions
and runs across the room.

				HAGEN
		Hello?

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		She's gone, Tom.

Sandra has followed him into Michael's house.

				HAGEN
		What do you mean gone?

				SANDRA
		The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came
		by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried
		to say she wasn't in, but Kay
		spotted them and asked if they
		would take her and the kids for a
		ride.  That was three hours ago.

				HAGEN
			(furious)
		Why didn't someone tell me!

				SANDRA
		I wanted to tell you alone; your
		wife doesn't know what's going on.

Hagen rushes out of the house.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY

Hagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across
the lawn to the boathouse.

				HAGEN'S SON
		Hey, Dad!

This time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to
Rocco, who is by some men near the boathouse.

				HAGEN
		Rocco!

				ROCCO
		I know.  I went down to the Barrett
		house.  But she's gone.  They drove
		her and the kids to North Tahoe
		airport.

				HAGEN
		Goddamn it, where were you?

				ROCCO
		I was in my house.  Willy tried,
		but it would have taken some
		strong-arm to stop her, and he
		figured you wouldn't want that.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

They enter the boathouse.

				HAGEN
			(to one of the men)
		Get me a Scotch and water.

The man hurries behind the bar.

				ROCCO
		She took a flight to San Francisco.
		We figure she's going to connect to
		New Hampshire; her parents' place.

				HAGEN
			(almost to himself)
		I can't let him down.

He swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks
up to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown
such weakness.

				HAGEN
		All right, let me think a minute.

Rocco clears the men out.

				ROCCO
		Me too, Tom?

				HAGEN
		Yeah, give me a minute.

Rocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours
himself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself.

				HAGEN
		Oh Christ, Pop.  It was so good
		when you were alive.  I felt I
		could handle anything...

EXT. VIEW FROM BOAT - FULL VIEW - DAY

A beautiful coastal view of a tropical Caribbean city.  An
extraordinary view, high buildings, palm trees, all set
right on the bay.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

on the cruiser, Bussetta a little distance away, watching,
but never speaking.  The dark-skinned CAPTAIN of the cruiser
keeps pointing repeatedly.

				CAPTAIN
		Habana, Habana.

EXT. HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Michael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making
its way through the streets of Havana.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out the window.

MICHAEL'S POV

Crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the
tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans
walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we
see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,
carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all
of these street impressions, the city is booming with
activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and
pimps and little children begging in the streets.

MED. VIEW

The big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is
sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in
the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees
four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their
hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.
The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away
in Spanish.

INT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Michael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the
hotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently
completed.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH,
who ushers him toward the casino entrance.

				SAM ROTH
		Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.
		Welcome to the Capri; my brother's
		upstairs.  You wanta take a rest
		before you see him, or can I get
		you something, anything at all?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'm fine.

He leads Michael into the main casino.

				SAM ROTH
		This is it!  We think it makes
		Vegas look like the corner crap game.

				MICHAEL
		Very impressive.

				SAM ROTH
		Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,
		I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he
		manages the casino for us.

				COHEN
			(appreciating
			Michael's status)
		Mr. Corleone.

Sam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand.

				SAM ROTH
		Pleasure to meet you, I'm sure...

He gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an
attractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from
a prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller
man, standing to his rear.

				LEON
			(Spanish)
		Most respected gentlemen, allow me
		to welcome you to the City of
		Havana, the Republic of Cuba on
		behalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio
		Batista.

THE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for
this meeting.

				LEON (O.S.)
		I'd like to thank this distinguished
		group of American Industrialists,
		for continuing to work with Cuba,
		for the greatest period of
		prosperity in her entire history.
		Mr. William Proxmiro, representing
		the General Fruit Company... Messrs.
		Corngold and Dant, of the United
		Telephone and Telegraph Company; Mr.
		Petty, regional Vice-President of
		the Pan American Mining Corporation;
		and, of course, our friend Mr.
		Robert Allen, of South American
		Sugar.  Mr. Nash of the American
		State Department.  And Mr. Hyman
		Roth of Miami, and Michael Corleone
		of Nevada representing our
		Associates in Tourism and Leisure
		Activities.

VIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP

Leon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he
lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see.

				LEON
		The President would like to take
		this opportunity to thank U T&T for
		their lovely gift: a solid gold
		telephone!  He thought all you
		gentlemen would care to take a look
		at it.

He hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is
passed in turn to each of the men in attendance.

				CORNGOLD
		Your Excellency, perhaps you could
		discuss the status of rebel activity
		and how this may affect our
		businesses.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing
it on to Hyman Roth.

				LEON (O.S.)
		Of course.  The rebel movement is
		basically unpopular, and since July
		of 1958 has been contained in the
		Oriente Province, in the mountains
		of the Sierra Muestre.

Michael passes the phone on to Roth.

				LEON
			(continuing)
		We began a highly successful
		offensive against them in March,
		and activities within the city
		itself are at a minimum.  I can
		assure you we'll tolerate no
		guerrillas in the casinos or
		swimming pools!

General subdued laughter.

A CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY

Police are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the
cars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is
being driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and
says something in Spanish to the driver.

The driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.

				DRIVER
		He says it will just be a short
		time and they'll let us through.

Michael looks out the window.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

The old building has been totally surrounded by police and
military vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting
lazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready.
There is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the
men brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says
something in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their
weapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of
civilians out of the building with their hands up.

They are moved over to some military truck, where they are
frisked before being loaded.

All of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose,
and rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself
into the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A
second later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously
having hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own
life to take the life of the Captain.

There is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

watching.  The police rush to Michael's car and guide it
outside of the trouble area.

MED. VIEW

as they lead and escort the Mercury out of the area.

EXT. HAVANA COUNTRY CLUB - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Some glasses; rum is poured into them; then Coca Cola.
Quarter limes are squeezed.

				SAM ROTH (O.S.)
		Rum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of
		fresh lime...

Sam prepares the drinks for his brother, Hyman, and a group
of men, including Michael.

				MAN
		Cuba Libres.

				MICHAEL
		I was told the Cubans now call this
		drink: "La Mentira."

				ROTH
		I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		It means... "The Lie."

A moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two
Cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake
on it.

				SAM ROTH
		The cake is here.

They all raise their glasses to the old man.

				EVERYONE
			(ad lib)
		Happy Birthday!

Roth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.

				ROTH
		I hope my age is correct: I am
		always accurate about my age.

Some laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece
on plates, and carry them to the different men.

				ROTH
		Everything we've learned in Vegas
		is true here; but we can go further.
		The bigger, the swankier, the
		plusher the store, the more a sense
		of legitimacy, and the bigger
		business we do.
			(looking at the plate
			brought to him)
		A smaller piece.  What we've
		proposed to the Cuban Government is
		that it put up half the cash on a
		dollar for dollar basis.
			(accepting a smaller piece)
		Thank you.  We can find people in
		the United States who will put up
		our share for a small piece of the
		action, yet we will retain control.

				ONE OF THE MEN
		How much?

				ROTH
		A hundred million dollars.  But
		only if this Government relaxes its
		restrictions on importing building
		materials; we'll need some new
		laws, too, but that will be no
		difficulty.

				ANOTHER MAN
		What are import duties now?

				ROTH
		As much as seventy percent.  Also,
		I'm working out an arrangement with
		the Minister of Labor so that all
		our pit bosses, stick-men and
		Dealers, can be considered
		specialized technicians eligible
		for two year visas.  As of now
		they're only allowed in Cuba for
		six months at a time.  In short,
		we're in a full partnership with
		the Cuban Government.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

is handed a piece of cake.  Roth moves over to a folder of
documents.

				ROTH
			(continuing)
		Here are applications from Friends
		all over the States.  I understand
		Santo Virgilio in Tampa is trying
		to make his own deal.  Well, the
		Cuban Government will brush him off.
		The Lakeville Road Boys are going
		to take over the Nacionale here.
		I'm planning a new hotel casino to
		be known as Riviera.  The new Capri
		will go to the Corleone Family.

MED. VIEW

The cake is sliced and carried to each of the men.

				ROTH
		Then there's the Sevilla Biltmore;
		the Havana Hilton, which is going
		to cost twenty-four million --
		Cuban banks will put up half, the
		Teamsters will bankroll the rest.
		Generally, there will be friends
		for all our friends including the
		Lieutenant Governor of Nevada;
		Eddie Levine of Newport will bring
		in the Pennino Brothers, Dino and
		Eddie; they'll handle actual casino
		operations.

And seeing that all of his friends have been served, Roth
raises his fork.

				ROTH
		Enjoy.

				MICHAEL
		I saw an interesting thing today.
		A man was being arrested by the
		Military Police; probably an urban
		guerrilla.  Rather than be taken
		alive, he exploded a grenade hidden
		in his jacket, taking the command
		vehicle with him.

The various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering
what the point of it is.

				MICHAEL
		It occurred to me: the police are
		paid to fight, and the Rebels are
		not.

				SAM ROTH
		So?

				MICHAEL
		So, that occurred to me.

VIEW ON ROTH

He understands Michael's point, if the others do not.

				ROTH
		This country has had rebels for the
		last fifty years; it's part of
		their blood.  Believe me, I know...
		I've been coming here since the
		twenties; we were running molasses
		out of Havana when you were a baby.
		To trucks owned by your father.
			(he chuckles warmly
			over the memory)
		We'll talk when we're alone.

And he returns his attention to the men who are gathered
with him on his birthday.

EXT. ROTH'S PRIVATE TERRACE - DAY

Michael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that
overlooks the city.

				ROTH
		You have to be careful what you say
		in front of the others... they
		frighten easy.  It's always been
		that way, most men frighten easy.

				MICHAEL
		We're making a big investment in
		Cuba.  That's my only concern.

				ROTH
		My concern is that the three
		million never arrived at Batista's
		numbered account in Switzerland.
		He thinks it's because you have
		second thoughts about his ability
		to stop the rebels.

				MICHAEL
		The money was sent.

				ROTH
		Then you have to trace it.  Michael,
		people here look at me as a reliable
		man.  I can't afford not to be
		looked on as a reliable man.  But
		you know all that; there's nothing
		you can learn from me.  You
		shouldn't have to put up with a
		sick old man as a partner.

				MICHAEL
		I wouldn't consider anyone else.

				ROTH
		Except the President of the United
		States.

He laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between
them.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully
stifles with a handkerchief.

				ROTH
		If only I could live to see it,
		kid; to be there with you.  How
		beautifully we've done it, step by
		step.  Here, protected, free to
		make our profits without the
		Justice Department, the FBI; ninety
		miles away in partnership with a
		friendly government.  Ninety miles,
		just a small step, looking for a
		man who desperately wants to be
		President of the United States, and
		having the cash to make it possible.

				MICHAEL
		You'll be there to see it; you'll
		be there.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - NIGHT

The telephone has just rung; Michael listens.

				OPERATOR
		We have your call to Tahoe, Nevada,
		sir.

				MICHAEL
		Thank you.
			(click, click)
		Tom?  Tom, is that you?

				ROCCO (O.S.)
		No, Tom's out of town.  This is
		Rocco.  Who is this?

Michael is openly disturbed that Hagen is not there.  He
hangs up without answering.

EXT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - DAY

Tom Hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively, and then
steps toward the door of a pleasant New England house.  He
rings the bell and waits, hat in hand.  A moment later, the
door opens, and Kay is standing there.

				KAY
		I'm not surprised to see you, Tom.

INT. SMALL ROOM - NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Out to the yard, where we can see glimpses of little Anthony
playing by himself.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I can't love a man like that; I
		can't live with him, I can't let
		him be father to my children.  Look.

The little boy, moodily by himself.

VIEW ON KAY

obviously moved.

				KAY
		He's not like a little boy... he
		doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want
		to play; he doesn't like other
		children, he doesn't like toys.
		It's as though he's waiting for the
		time he can take his Father's place.
			(almost in tears)
		You know what he told me when he
		was four years old.  He said he had
		killed his Grandfather...

VIEW ON HAGEN

listening, calmly.

				KAY
		... He said he had shot his
		Grandfather with a gun, and then he
		died in the garden.  And he asked
		me... he asked me, Tom, if that
		meant now his father would shoot
		him out of... revenge.
			(she cries)
		How does a four year old boy learn
		the word... 'revenge'?

				HAGEN
		Kay... Kay...

VIEW ON KAY

				KAY
		What kind of a family is this...
		are we human beings?  He knows his
		Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He
		heard Connie.

				HAGEN
		You don't know that's true.  But
		Kay, just for the sake of an
		argument, let's assume it is, I'm
		not saying it is, remember, but...
		What if I gave you what might be
		some justification for what he
		did... or rather some possible
		justification for what he possibly
		did.

				KAY
		That's the first time I've seen the
		lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not
		your best side.

				HAGEN
		Okay, just hear me out.  What if
		Carlo had been paid to help get
		Sonny killed?  What if his beating
		of Connie that time was a deliberate
		plot to get Sonny out into the open?
		Then what?  And what if the Don, a
		great man, couldn't bring himself
		to do what he had to do, avenge his
		son's death by killing his
		daughter's husband?  What if that,
		finally, was too much for him, and
		he made Michael his successor,
		knowing that Michael would take
		that load off his shoulders, would
		take that guilt?

				KAY
		He's not the same as when I met him.

				HAGEN
		If he were, he'd be dead by now.
		You'd be a widow.  You'd have no
		problem.

				KAY
		What the hell does that mean?  Come
		on, Tom, speak out straight once in
		your life.  I know Michael can't,
		but you're not Sicilian, you can
		tell a woman the truth; you can
		treat her like an equal, a fellow
		human being.

There is a long silence.

Then Hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more.

				HAGEN
		If you told Michael what I've told
		you today, I'm a dead man.

				KAY
		When is it finally over?  I want it
		to be over before my baby is born.

				HAGEN
		I don't know.  I hope soon; but
		it's not over yet, and that's why
		you and the kids have to come back
		to me.

He looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with
her safety and her children's.

He is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and
overwrought.

VIEW ON THE WINDOW

Little Anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane,
as though he senses the adults are discussing something of
importance to him.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL-CASINO - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The Baccarat table.  Busy, hundred dollar bills being played.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		Mr. Corleone; Mr. Freddie Corleone,
		telephone please.

				PIT BOSS
		Not here.

VIEW ON THE CRAP TABLES

The play is fast; pit boss presiding; but no sign of Fredo.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		Telephone for Mr. Corleone.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CASINO

We see Neri, ominous, presiding over the entire store.  He
picks up a pit telephone.

				NERI
		He's backstage.
			(and hangs up disgustedly)

INT. TROPICANA BACKSTAGE AREA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Fredo is entertaining two showgirls done up in feathers and
what-have-you.

				FREDO
		C'mon, you got fifteen minutes
		before the finale!  I want to show
		you a trick with feathers.

				STAGEHAND
		Phone for you.

				FREDO
		Don't go away; wait a minute.

He takes the phone; we can catch a VIEW of the show going on
from the wings.

				FREDO
			(on the phone)
		Yeah.  Okay.  Who?  Mikey?  But...
		Si... si, caposco.
			(in Sicilian)
		Sure... how much?  I understand.
		Jesus, three million... I won't let
		you down.  Sure.

He hangs up thoughtfully.

				ONE OF THE GIRLS
		Freddie; we still got twelve
		minutes before the finale!

				FREDO
		Yeah... some other time.

EXT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY

There is a light rain.  Pentangeli steps out of his car;
points to Willy Cicci.

				PENTANGELI
		Wait in the car.

He walks up the street, to the bar, where he is greeted by
the tall, handsome Carmine Rosato.  They shake hands.
Pentangeli looks in his hand.

CLOSE VIEW

Rosato has put a crisp one hundred dollar bill in his hand,
folded sharply in two.

				PENTANGELI
		What's this?

				ROSATO
		That's a lucky C note for our new
		deal.

He puts his arm around Pentangeli, and they walk into the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The bar is fairly empty; and very dark.  Pentangeli and
Rosato step up to the bar; the bartender momentarily stops
polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks.

				ROSATO
		We were all real happy about your
		decision, Frankie; you're not goin'
		to regret it.

He holds up the glass.

				PENTANGELI
		I don't like the C-note.  I take it
		like an insult.

Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around Pentangeli's throat;
and he is forcefully yanked back into the shadows, all the
way into a wooden telephone booth.

CLOSE VIEW

The folded hundred dollar bill resting on the bar.

MED. CLOSE - THE PHONE BOOTH

We see only Pentangeli's feet and legs, struggling.  We HEAR
the terrible sounds of a man being strangled.

CLOSE ON ROSATO

Calm, and then he sees something that disturbs him.

				ROSATO
		Shit, your friend the cop!

Suddenly, the side door opens, and a shaft of sunlight cuts
through the darkness.

				COP
		Everything all right in there,
		Ritchie?  The door was open.

CLOSE ON THE PHONE BOOTH

Pentangeli's feet stop moving.

				RITCHIE
		Just cleaning up.
			(strained voice)
		You okay?

				COP
		Is that something on the floor?

				ROSATO
		Take him!

				VOICE
		Okay.

				RITCHIE
		Not here; not a cop, not here!

Two figures race through the shadows and race through the
doors.

				COP
			(shouting to his
			partner, in uniform)
		Stutz!  Watch out, Stutz!

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

We see that a patrol car had stopped for its routine visit.
STUTZ, the second patrolman, is just stepping out of his
car; Pentangeli's bodyguard, seeing the commotion, leaps out.
Three men, including Rosato, rush out.  There is gunfire;
Cicci is wounded.

MED. CLOSE

The patrolmen is grazed across the face; trying to stop the
flow of blood with his hand.

NEW VIEW

The three assailants jump into the car and drive off.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The stricken Pentangeli comes back to life.  He can barely
move his lips.

				PENTANGELI
		The bastard.  The dirty bastard, he
		gave me a C-note.  He gave me a C-
		note.

He sees the patrolman leaning over him.

EXT. PATROL CAR - DAY

The Sergeant is on the car radio.

				SERGEANT
		Frankie Pentangeli murder attempt.
		Patrolman Stutz shot.  Sahara
		Lounge - Utica Avenue and Claredon
		Road.  White Cadillac three or four
		men took off from scene.  Need
		ambulance; Stutz is bad.  Taking
		Pentangeli into custody...

INT. ROTH'S SUITE IN HAVANA - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON ROTH - DAY

His wizened face, pale.  Right now, though, his eyes have a
sparkle as he watches three million dollars in cold cash
being counted on a card table in front of him.

His brother Sam is present, and the sandy-haired Courier, a
little nervous; the one who had left from the Tropicana with
the Corleone skim-money.  Also Johnny Ola.  The money is
evidently all there; Roth picks up a packet; probably a
hundred thousand dollars, and throws it over to the Courier.

				ROTH
		Make it fast; I don't want to
		chance him being seen.

				COURIER
			(frightened)
		What about the arrangements?  How
		can I be sure about the arrangements?

				OLA
		Relax.  You're under our protection;
		the Corleone family will never find
		you.

Ola leads the Courier to the adjoining room where two
smartly dressed Military (Cuban) Police are standing, and a
civilian.  The Courier sees them, looks back to Ola.  One of
the police steps forward, placing the Courier under arrest;
handcuffing him.

				COURIER
		Hey, what's this?

The other takes the packet of money, and hands it to the
civilian, who places it in the briefcase he carries.  The
other officer kneels down and fastens leg manacles.

				COURIER
		The arrangements... YOU BASTARDS!
		What...

The Captain strikes him expertly across the side of his head
with his pistol.

Ola closes the door on this scene.

EXT. THE HAVANA CAPRI - DAY

Fredo Corleone steps out of a car, squints up at the sunshine
and palm trees.  He is holding on tightly to a small satchel,
which he won't let the bellman carry along with his other
things.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Michael and Fredo in a brother's embrace; they kiss each
other.  Fredo is still in his jacket, holding the satchel.

				FREDO
		Mikey.  How are you?

He glances up at Bussetta, who doesn't say a word.  Fredo
extends his hand.

				FREDO
		Hiya, Freddie Corleone.

				MICHAEL
		Mio fratello.

Then Bussetta offers his hand back to Fredo.

				FREDO
			(taking off his jacket)
		What a trip, Jesus Christ, the
		whole time I'm thinking what if
		someone knew what I got in here.

He undoes the combination of the briefcase starts taking out
cash.  Then he stops, remembering that there's a stranger in
the room.

				FREDO
		Oh, 'scuse me.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right.  He stays with me
		all the time.

				FREDO
		Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally
		in the dark.

				MICHAEL
		We're making an investment in Havana.

				FREDO
		Great, Havana's great.  Lots of
		activity in Havana!  Anybody I know
		here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?

				MICHAEL
		Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.

				FREDO
		I never met them.

				MICHAEL
		Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed
		by the Rosato Brothers.
			(pause)
		Didn't you know that?

				FREDO
		No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me
		anything?  I been kept in the dark
		so long, I'm getting used to it.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me, Fredo.

				FREDO
		That's what I'm here for.

				MICHAEL
		Tonight I want to relax with you.
		The Senator from Nevada is here
		with some people from Washington.
		I want to show them a good time in
		Havana.

				FREDO
		Count on me; that's my specialty.

				MICHAEL
		I'd like to come along.  There's
		been a lot of strain, and I've been
		cooped up in this room for three
		days.

				FREDO
		Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour
		to wash my face and do my research
		and we'll have these Washington
		suckers right where you want 'em.
			(then a thought
			strikes him)
		Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He
		always wanted to die in bed...with
		a broad.

INT. ROTH'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael stands at Roth's door carrying the briefcase that
Fredo had brought.

A hotel DOCTOR takes Hyman Roth's blood pressure, while his
wife waits nervously.

				DOCTOR
			(Spanish)
		You must not exert yourself; I will
		write out a prescription and come
		back tomorrow.

				HOTEL MAN
		He's going to write a prescription.

				ROTH
		I want my own doctor; fly him in
		from Miami.  I don't trust a doctor
		who can't speak English.

The doctor is shown out.  Roth gestures to the hotel man,
who also leaves.  Then he looks to his wife.

				ROTH
		Honey, go down to the casino?

				TERRI
		If you feel better...

				ROTH
		I do.  Play the Bingo game.

They kiss, and she leaves.  Also Bussetta and Ola remain.

				ROTH
		My sixth sense tells me you have a
		bag full of money in your hand.

Ola locks the door; Michael nods, and opens the bag, spilling
its contents on the card table.

				MICHAEL
		This doubles my investment.

				ROTH
		Still no word of your courier?
		We'll find him.  But at least this
		will satisfy our friends here.
		You've been invited to the New Year
		reception at the Presidential Home.
		I understand your brother is here
		as well; I hope he'll come.

				MICHAEL
		Six million dollars in cash is a
		high price for a piece of a country
		in the middle of a revolution.

Roth looks patiently at Michael, as though he were a child
who hadn't minded the lesson that he had been taught over
and over again.

				ROTH
		You're a careful kid, and that's
		good.  But look.  An international
		dispatch on the wire service.
		American journalism, not propaganda.
		The government troops have all but
		eliminated the rebels.  All but
		their radio station.

				MICHAEL
		I've read it; I'm pleased that the
		government is doing so well.  As a
		heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How
		did the doctor find you?

				ROTH
		Terrible.  I'd give twice this
		amount to take a piss without it
		hurting.

				MICHAEL
		Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?

				ROTH
			(taken a bit off-balance)
		Why...the Rosato Brothers.

				MICHAEL
		I know that; but who gave the go
		ahead.

Roth glances to Ola; he is not a fool; he realizes Michael
has begun to suspect him.

				MICHAEL
		I know it wasn't me...so that
		leaves you.

				ROTH
		There was this kid that I grew up
		with; he was a couple years younger
		than me, and sort of looked up to
		me, you know.  We did our first
		work together, worked our way out
		of the street.  Things were good
		and we made the most of it.  During
		prohibition, we ran molasses up to
		Canada and made a fortune; your
		father too.  I guess as much as
		anyone, I loved him and trusted him.
		Later on he had an idea to make a
		city out of a desert stop-over for
		G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast.
		That kid's name was Moe Greene, and
		the city he invented was Las Vegas.
		This was a great man; a man with
		vision and guts; and there isn't
		even a plaque or a signpost or a
		statue of him in that town.  Someone
		put a bullet through his eye; no
		one knows who gave the order.  When
		I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I
		knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong,
		and talking loud, and saying stupid
		things.  So when he turned up dead,
		I let it go, and said to myself:
		this is the business we've chosen.
		I never asked, who gave the go
		ahead because it had nothing to do
		with business.

He regards Michael silently a moment.

				ROTH
			(continuing)
		There's three million dollars on
		that table.  I'm going to lie down,
		maybe take a nap.  When I wake up,
		if it's still there, I'll know I
		have a partner.  If it's gone, then
		I'll know I don't.

The old man turns, and moves in his slippers, toward his
bedroom.

INT. THE CORRIDOR - DAY

Michael closes the door, and moves down the hallway.  He is
followed by Bussetta, who had waited in the corridor.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		How sick do you think the old man is?

				BUSSETTA
			(Sicilian)
		He'll live longer than me.

INT. TROPICOR NIGHT CLUB - VIEW ON THE SHOW - NIGHT

A Havana extravaganza, with tall, beautiful showgirls done
up in flamboyant, 'South-of-the-Border' Carmen Miranda
costumes; the lead singer is a six foot blonde doing "Rum
and Coca Cola" in that style.  Her name is YOLANDA.

MED. VIEW

At a large round table, located in an obvious VIP section of
the high, tropically draped room with living ferns and other
tropical planting with artificial stars.

Michael rises, to be introduced by Fredo to some conservative
looking Senatorial types, including Senator Pat Geary of
Nevada.  We notice Bussetta standing nearby.

				FREDO
		Does everyone know everyone, or
		nobody knows nobody.  Here, my
		brother, Michael Corleone... well,
		you know Senator Geary.

Geary warmly shakes Michael's hand.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we
		can spend this time together.

				FREDO
		This is Senator Payton from Florida;
		Judge DeMalco from New York...
		Senator Ream... Mr. Questadt from
		California, he's a lawyer with the
		Price-Control Administration.  And
		Fred Corngold of U T&T.

They all make themselves comfortable.  A waiter with a tray
of drinks appears.

				FREDO
		Gentlemen... your pleasure?  Cuba
		Libres, Pina Coladas, you name it.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'll take a Yolanda.

Laughter.

				FREDO
		Later, later.  All those girls look
		like they're on stilts!

The various tropical drinks are distributed.

				SENATOR GEARY
		To a night in Havana!

They all join in.

				FREDO
			(aside to Michael)
		Jeeze, it's great you came along,
		Mike... You know, we've never spent
		a night out on the town together.
		I always thought you looked down on
		me for liking a good time.

				MICHAEL
		I never looked down on you, Fredo.
		You don't look down at a brother.

INT. THE CASINO - NIGHT

By now the group has made its way into the casino.  Some of
them are crowded around the crap table; Senator Geary is
with the enormous and beautiful Yolanda, who barely speaks
English.  There are other girls with some of the men; not
with Michael, who gambles dollars while talking to Corngold.

				CORNGOLD
		Our information is that Castro is
		dead.  There are maybe a few
		hundred die-hards in the Sierra
		Muestra; but government troops are
		going to clean them out any day.

Johnny Ola approaches Michael.

				OLA
		Mike, can I talk to you.

Michael follows Ola toward the Baccarat table; a watchful
Bussetta moves, a distance away, with them.

				OLA
		Listen, this Senator from Florida
		already has a hundred grand worth
		of markers on the table.

We can see Senator Ream at the table, making thousand dollar
bets on the Bank.

				OLA
		They asked him to sign paper to
		take down the markers; but he got
		mad; told them to wait until he was
		finished.

				MICHAEL
		Let him gamble.

				OLA
		Okay.  You know he doesn't have
		that kind of money.

				FREDO
		Mike said let him gamble.

Fredo puts his arm around his brother; he is high with the
first attention Mike has ever given him, as though finally
he is being taken seriously; as though his brother needs him.

				FREDO
		Mike, I got something special up my
		sleeve for these boys.  You ever
		hear of "Superman?" And I don't
		mean the comic book.

				MICHAEL
		No.

				FREDO
		Wait'll you see!

INT. HAVANA BAR - NIGHT

Our group are in a large Havana bar; the walls totally
covered with hundreds of fifths of different types of rum
and other liquor.

A couple of the girls from the show are out with the men;
Yolanda herself is giving them a private song and dance.

Fredo is a little loaded, and especially attentive to
Michael this night.

				FREDO
		Mikey, why would they ever hit poor
		old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved
		that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember
		when he was just a 'button,' when
		we were kids.  We used to put
		bedsheets on our heads, you know,
		like we were ghosts.  An' ole
		Frankie come peek into our room,
		we'd jump up, and he'd always
		pretend like he was really scared.
		You remember?

				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.

				FREDO
		You?  What do you mean you, I
		thought...

				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.

				FREDO
		You?  What do you mean you, I
		thought...

				MICHAEL
		It was Frankie tried to have me hit.

				FREDO
		No.  I mean, are you sure?

				MICHAEL
		You know otherwise, Freddie?

				FREDO
		Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything.
		Fellas!  You're all falling asleep.
		We got to see Superman.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

A growing feeling about his brother.

EXT. GARISH HAVANA STREET - NIGHT

The street is lit with tons of neon signs; it is alive with
people; some roving bands of musicians.  Everywhere are
little boys running around, begging for money.  And in
doorways and windows are silent, dark-skinned women.

				SENATOR REAM
			(pushing away from
			the palm outstretched
			little hands of the boys)
		Goddamn beggers.  Goddamn city of
		beggars and pimps and whores.  And
		we bend over backwards to support
		them with the goddamn sugar quota.

				FREDO
			(to Geary)
		What's eating him?

				SENATOR GEARY
		He lost a quarter million dollars
		at the casino.

				SENATOR REAM
		...goddamn city of whores...

				SENATOR GEARY
		He gave them a bad check.

INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step-
like around a circular area which becomes a stage.

There are a hundred or so people, practically all men,
tourists and business men, standing on the different levels,
forming the audience.

In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole,
to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white
sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some
Latin music.

MED. VIEW

Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the
spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late
hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using
this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some
important conclusions.

				QUESTADT
		Why do we have to stand?

				FREDO
		Everyone stands.  But it's worth
		it, watch!

VIEW ON THE ARENA

Now two high priestesses, scantily clad, bring in a tall and
muscular Cuban, done up in chains and loin cloth, as though
he were a captured slave.  This is SUPERMAN

VIEW ACROSS THE MEN TO THE STAGE

				FREDO
		That's him; that's Superman!

Some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on, as the
priestesses lead the slave to the virgin tied to the post.
The music is percussive and wild.

MED. VIEW ON THE MEN

				SENATOR GEARY
		Ohmygod.  I don't believe it.

				QUESTADT
		It's got to be fake.

				FREDO
		That's why they call him Superman.
		Johnny Ola told me about this; I
		didn't believe it.

CLOSE on Michael turning away.  Not because of the spectacle
which he finds disgusting, but at what his brother is saying.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		... but seeing is believing.  Ole
		Johnny knows all the places.  I
		tol' you... can you believe it?

If Michael would ever allow himself to cry, it would be now.

				FREDO
			(continuing)
		The old man Roth, would never come;
		but Johnny knows these places like
		the back of his hand...

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - MORNING

Michael is alone in his bedroom; it seems as though he
hasn't slept very much, but sits by his window, looking out
at the city.  He is troubled and tired.

His radio is on:

				RADIO
			(Spanish)
		"This is Rebel Radio: Rebel troops
		of Column Four 'Jose Marti' took
		the town of Baire yesterday at 8:30
		p.m.  The enemy has retreated..."

EXT. CUBAN STREET - MORNING

This street in Havana is like a Caribbean tourist city with
no indication of the revolution in progress.

Michael walks along the street, alone, past the Cubans on
their way to work; past the American ladies who have gotten
up early for their shopping spree.

				RADIO
			(Spanish)
			 (continuing)
		... An important military action is
		developing along a 35-kilometer
		stretch of the Central Highway.
		Numerous enemy garrisons are left
		with two alternatives, surrender or
		annihilation...

One full block away, Bussetta rides in the front seat of the
dark Mercury, driving slowly, giving Michael his privacy,
but never letting him out of Bussetta's sight.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

watching.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Shopkeepers happily luring the tourists into their shops in
broken English.  Havana is prosperous.

				RADIO
			(continuing)
		... Victories in war depend on a
		minimum on weapons and to a maximum
		on morale...

VIEW ON MICHAEL

glances back to the dark car following him.  In a moment, it
pulls up to him, and he gets into the back seat.

EXT. AMERICAN MILITARY MISSION - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

standing by his car, looking through the cyclone fencing
that borders this military training camp operated by the
American Army near the city.

				RADIO
		... War is not a simple question of
		rifles, bullets, guns and planes...

CLOSER VIEW INTO THE CAMP

EXT. HAVANA STREET - DAY

A street singer, followed by a guitarist sings Jose Marti's
words of "Guantanamera." It is solemn, as though it is a
song of protest, a song of the revolution.

Nearby, in a restaurant, Michael has lunch with Fredo.

				MICHAEL
		How is your wife, Fredo...your
		marriage?

				FREDO
			(eating)
		You know her; drives me crazy, one
		minute she's a popsicle, the next
		she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I
		think... I think - I should a
		married someone, like you did.  To
		have kids, to have a family.

Michael turns, distracted for a moment at something the
singer has sung.

				MICHAEL
		"Yo soy un hombre sincero..."
		I am a sincere man,
		From the land of the palms...

				FREDO
		What's that?

				MICHAEL
		The song.  Are you sincere with me,
		Fredo?

				FREDO
		Sincere.  What are you talking
		about, of course I'm sincere with
		you, Mike.

				MICHAEL
		Then I'm going to confide in you;
		trust you with something.

				FREDO
			(Sicilian)
		Mike, are you crazy, I'm your
		brother.

				MICHAEL
		Tonight we've been invited to a
		reception at the Presidential
		Palace; to bring in the New Year.
		You and I will go in a special car
		that's being sent.  They'll have
		cocktails... then dinner, and a
		reception with the President.  When
		it's over, it will be suggested
		that you take Questadt and his
		friends from Washington to spend
		the night with some women.  I'll go
		home alone in the car; and before I
		reach the hotel, I'll be
		assassinated.

				FREDO
		...Who?

				MICHAEL
		The same man who tried in Nevada...
		Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

				FREDO
		But, you told me yourself...

				MICHAEL
		It was never Pentangeli... I've
		always known that.  It was Roth all
		along.  He talks to me as a son; as
		his successor, but the old man
		thinks he'll live forever.

				FREDO
		What do you want me to do?

				MICHAEL
		To go tonight, with me, as though
		we know nothing.  I've already made
		my move.

				FREDO
		What is it?  Can I help?

				MICHAEL
		The old man will never bring in the
		New Year.

Fredo realizes what he means; looks immediately to Bussetta,
who had been sitting near the door and the musicians.  He is
gone.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW ON BUSSETTA - NIGHT

The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us
quickly.  He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite.
Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to
the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears
inside.

A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused
Johnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the
corridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to
return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two
from behind.

INT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

as Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his
head bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of
the couch.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

Guards who are regular troops patrol the Palace in twos,
carrying machine weapons.

Now an elite officer, checks the identification of the
various cars carrying dignitaries, as they are driven up to
the Palace.  The one being inspected at the moment contains
Fredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed
people on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful
mood of this New Year's Eve.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees
with electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body
to the small balcony which all the rooms have.

EXT. THE BALCONY - NIGHT

Bussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony
railing; tying the extension cord to the railing, and
suspending the body so that it is invisible both from the
inside and out during the night.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - VIEW ON THE MAIN FOYER - NIGHT

The PRESIDENT, his WIFE and six oldest CHILDREN great
formally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests.
He speaks to them in Spanish, as one by one they file to him.

Michael and Fredo are presented in a group with several
other Americans, including several of the American
businessmen with interests in Cuba.

EXT. STREETS OF HAVANA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The excitement of the night is beginning to build; people
are out in the streets; poor people, but they are
enthusiastic and lively.

NEW VIEW

Traffic stops, as an ambulance speeds its way to a hospital;
SIREN going.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had
fallen from the couch, and replaces it as though nothing had
happened.  Slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins
Roth's bedroom.  There is a slight commotion; whispered
voices.

BUSSETTA'S VIEW

Terri, Mrs. Roth, is crying.  A group of men lift Hyman
Roth's frail body onto a stretcher.

CLOSE ON BUSSETTA

realizes that this is the man he is to kill.

CLOSER VIEW ON ROTH

He is alive; breathing hard with his mouth dry and open.
The doctor examines him, and then gives instructions to the
orderly who carries him out, presumably to the ambulance.

Bussetta closes the door on this VIEW.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters
serve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  Michael relaxes with
Senator Geary, Major Leon, and several of the Americans.

				QUESTADT
		The embargo on arms shipments from
		the U.S. to your government, was
		just a necessary public relations
		move... Only last month, your air
		force received a major shipment of
		rockets...

Michael glances at his watch; Fredo concentrates on this.

				SENATOR GEARY
		We believe in non-intervention...
		but the agreement stipulates that
		our forces may be withdrawn... but
		as you've seen, we have not
		withdrawn them.

				CORNGOLD
		And my guess is that President
		Eisenhower won't pull out while we
		have over three billion invested
		over here.

				MICHAEL
		Fredo.  Where are you going?

				FREDO
		Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a
		refill.  How about you?

EXT. HAVANA HOSPITAL - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The ambulance makes its way up to the emergency section of
the hospital.  The orderlies quickly carry the old man
inside.  His wife and the doctor, and several of his men,
follow in another car.

THE VIEW ALTERS

and we see Bussetta waiting in the shadows.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The growing crowds of Cubans begin their celebration.

NEW VIEW

A Cuban military detachment speeds along in the night,
motorcyclists clear a path through the celebrants.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

A full sitdown dinner is being served the guests.  Michael
sits at a table at dinner with several of the distinguished
Cubans, and some of the American businessmen.

				QUESTADT
		What's kept Mr. Roth?

Fredo looks up at Michael.

In the back of the room, we notice the detachment of military
moving quickly through the reception room on their way to
the President's private quarters.  Michael notices it as well.

INT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The activity at the end of the hall has come to rest; we can
tell that the doctor tells Mrs. Roth that she should go, the
old man will be taken to a room where he can rest.
Gradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital
staff.

Bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the
old man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to
the room.

HIS VIEW

A nurse sits in the room in attendance; Hyman Roth is
asleep, his mouth wide open, breathing noisily.

VIEW ON BUSSETTA

hears footsteps, quickly steps away from the door, and into
another room.

Some nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in
Spanish; one has brought a small bottle of wine, and
obviously they are inviting the nurse to have a New Year's
toast with them.  They laugh; and the nurse steps away from
the room for a moment.

Bussetta moves slowly back into the room, alone with the
helpless Roth.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW ON THE GUESTS - NIGHT

seeing in the New Year; a great banner is hoisted up in
Spanish, welcoming 1959.

Hands are shaken; kisses exchanged.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

Michael and Fredo in an embrace; they kiss one another.

				MICHAEL
		I've arranged for a plane; we're
		going to Miami in an hour.  Try not
		to make a big thing of it.

He kisses his brother once again.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know it was you, Fredo.  You've
		broken my heart.

Slowly, understanding, Fredo backs away from his brother,
taking the kiss another way.

A little distance away, Major Leon notices an old woman, one
of the President's maids, moving across the alcove, carrying
her suitcases.

				LEON
		What a pity; she's crying.  Must
		have been fired, and she's been
		with the President's family for
		twenty years.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The gathered crowd joyously welcomes the New Year.  We
notice the continual military movement.

MED. VIEW

A family surreptitiously leaves their home, carrying
suitcases and belongings.

INT. ROTH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Bussetta raises a hospital pillow, and easily begins to
smother the thin old man, who can barely struggle.

OUT IN THE HALL

A detachment of military move quickly, accompanied by some
of Roth's men, as though they have important news that must
be dealt with.

They pass the small group of aides and nurses welcoming the
New Year.

Seeing them, the nurse assigned to him, puts down her glass
and moves quickly to the room.

She opens the door, and lays bare the sight of Bussetta
smothering Roth.  Bussetta turns quickly; and one of the
military takes out his pistol and shoots several times at
his head.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

The entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement;
all the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns,
standing with frightened faces like first class passengers
on a doomed ship.  The President himself, his back to our
VIEW, is making an announcement in Spanish.  While he
speaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff,
carrying suitcases and possessions.

				PRESIDENT
		...Because of serious setbacks of
		our troops in Guantanamo and
		Santiago, we feel reluctantly, that
		we must leave the Capital at once.
		Myself and my family must bid you
		goodbye, and good fortune.  We will
		go directly to Ciudad Trujillo.

The crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout
the guests.

The only one who is not completely taken off guard is
Michael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.

				PRESIDENT
		...My only regret is that there
		could not have been more warning...
		As my last official act as
		President, I hereby appoint a
		provisional government with Dr.
		Carlos M. Piedra, as its President.

By now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can
they get out, and with what.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

We see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already
cars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in
haste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees
Fredo, watching him in fear.

				MICHAEL
		Come with me.  It's your only way
		of getting out!

VIEW ON FREDO

Terrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs
away into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

Finally, he has to step into the car and it roars off.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

Rebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news
that Batista has conceded...this throws the crowds already
gathered for the New Year into cheers of joy.

They harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in
their car.

The people pull them out of the car, opening their suitcases,
out of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street.

Michael's car makes its way as the crowd cheers: "El animale
se fue!"

EXT. THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Crowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos
are trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the
families and possessions.

We see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working
their way through the crowds, shouting that they are
Americans in order to get preference on the line.  Often
that declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds.

Sometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but
again, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with
money and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere.

EXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

All forms of private transportation are jammed with people
trying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone
with a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida.

A car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of
their men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a
private cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns.

Within seconds, they are on their way to Miami.

EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

Things are no different at the airport; where anything that
can fly is being jammed with refugees and their money.

A wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast
airplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into
the plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking
his watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks
only English.

				PILOT
		No, this is a private plane.  No,
		this plane is taken.

Finally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches
the Pilot.

				MICHAEL
		He isn't here.

				PILOT
		We've got to leave, they'll take
		this thing apart.

				MICHAEL
		All right.  Go now.

The Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at
them, and begins searching for another plane for his family.

INT. THE PLANE - VIEW ON THE PILOT - NIGHT

as the propeller turns over.

EXT. THE AIRPORT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

Groups of the cheering, celebrating Cubans sing
"Guantanamera," now as a song of triumph.

INT. THE PLANE - MOVING VIEW - MICHAEL - NIGHT

Closer to him, his personal and business life caught in the
middle of history.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - DAY (1920)

He stops to pick out some choice oranges and peaches from a
fruit stand.  Then he reaches into his pocket for change.

				VENDOR
		No, no.  It is my pleasure to make
		this a gift.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

				VITO
		You are kind.  If ever I can do
		something for you, in return,
		please come to me.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY

Despite his new position of 'respect,' there is little
changed about his home.  Only that they have lived there a
while now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable
possessions a young family acquires.

He kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows
her the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something
on her mind.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		What is it?

				CARMELLA
			(Sicilian)
		Come...

They step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman,
waiting nervously.

				CARMELLA
		The Signora is a friend of mine.
		She has a favor to ask of you.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why do you come to me?

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
			(Sicilian)
		She told me to ask you.

He seems surprised; looks to his wife.

				CARMELLA
		She is having some trouble.  Her
		landlord has received complaints
		because of her dog.  He told her to
		get rid of it, but her boy loved
		it, so they tried to hide it.  When
		the landlord found out, he was so
		angry, he ordered her to leave.
		Even if she truly will let the dog
		go.

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
			(Sicilian)
		He said he would have the police
		put us out.

				VITO
			(thoughtfully)
		I can give you some money to help
		you move, is that what you want?

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
		My friends are all here; how can I
		move to another neighborhood with
		strangers?  I want you to speak to
		the landlord to let me stay.

Vito nods to the frightened old woman.

				VITO
		It's done then.  You won't have to
		move; I'll speak to him tomorrow
		morning.

Carmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not
acknowledge.

The old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not
convinced.

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
		You're sure he'll say yes, the
		landlord?

				VITO
		I'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow.
		Once I explain how things are with
		you, I'm sure he'll take pity on
		your misfortunes.  Don't let it
		trouble you any more.
			(as he shows her out)
		Guard your health, for the sake of
		your children.

EXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY

SIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone
angrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings.

He carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil
concerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken
window here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick
up some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to
himself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker.

				VITO (O.S.)
		Signore Roberto...

He rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone.

				VITO
		The friend of my wife, a poor widow
		with no man to protect her, tells
		me that for some reason she has
		been ordered to move from your
		building.  She is in despair.  She
		has no money, she has no friends
		except those that live here.

Signor Roberto brusquely answers, and continues on his way.

				ROBERTO
		I have already rented the apartment
		to another family.

MOVING SHOT ON THE TWO

				VITO
		I told her I would speak to you,
		that you are a reasonable man who
		acted out of some misunderstanding.
		She has gotten rid of the animal
		that caused all the trouble, so why
		shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian
		to another, I ask you the favor.

				ROBERTO
		I've already rented it; I cannot
		disappoint the new tenants.  They're
		paying a higher rent.

				VITO
		How much more a month?

				ROBERTO
		Eh...
			(we sense he is lying)
		Five dollars more.

Vito reaches into his pocket, and takes out a roll of bills.

				VITO
		Here is the six month's increase in
		advance.  You needn't speak to her
		about it, she's a proud woman.  See
		me again in another six months.
		But of course, you'll let her keep
		her dog.

				ROBERTO
		Like hell!  And who the hell are
		you to give me orders.  Watch your
		manners or you'll be on your
		Sicilian ass in the street there.

Vito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable.

				VITO
		I'm asking you a favor, only that.
		One never knows when one might need
		a friend, isn't that true?  Here,
		take this money as a sign of my
		good-will, and make your own
		decision.  I won't quarrel with it.
			(he puts the money in
			Roberto's hand)
		Do me this little favor, just take
		it and think carefully.  Tomorrow
		morning if you want to give me the
		money back, by all means do so.  If
		you want the woman out of your
		house, how can I stop you?  It's
		your property, after all.  If you
		don't want the dog in there, I can
		understand.  I dislike dogs myself.
			(he pats Roberto on
			the shoulder)
		Do me this service, eh?  I won't
		forget it.  Ask your friends in
		this neighborhood about me, they'll
		tell you I'm a man who believes in
		showing his gratitude.

Without a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto
standing in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the
money.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

A thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in
this Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.

He carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is
pursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about
his own age, eighteen.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Kid, where do you live?

				ANOTHER
		Where'd you get those nigger lips?

He tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,
steps in front of him and stops him.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Say 'bread' in Italian.

				ANOTHER
		He dunno.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Go on; how do you say 'bread' in
		Italian?  If you're from the
		neighborhood, you should know how
		to say 'bread' in Italian.

An amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee
house, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the
neighborhood, and loves a fight.

				CLEMENZA
		What's up?

				ITALIAN BOY
		This kid lives around here, but he
		can't say bread in Italian.

				CLEMENZA
		That's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at
		those pregnant lips!

He giggles at his own joke.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Are you a Jewboy?

The boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Well, if you're not a Jew, say
		'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.

And with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,
sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a
clatter.

The other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to
the boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold
of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement
as well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the
sidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.

				CLEMENZA
		Alright, alright, cut it out.

				SECOND ITALIAN
		What for?  He killed Jesus Christ!

Clemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.

				CLEMENZA
		I said cut it out!
			(to the beaten kid)
		What's your name?

				HYMAN
		Hyman Suchowsky.

				ITALIAN BOY
		I don't believe it.  In our
		neighborhood, with a name like that!

				CLEMENZA
		What are those tools?  You work on
		cars?

				HYMAN
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe I know how you can make a
		couple of extra bucks working as a
		mechanic.

The boy seems agreeable.

				CLEMENZA
		But you gotta know how to keep your
		mouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get
		rid of that name.  I'll call you
		Johnny Lips.
			(he giggles at his
			own humor again)
		Come on...

He leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the
side:

				CLEMENZA
		Bread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,
		pane.  Don't forget.

INT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY

A newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new
product "GENCO PURA" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a
new business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one
rattling old truck, and a few stock boys.

Genco has become the accountant-business manager, based on
the experience working with his father.  But it is clear,
that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the
new enterprise.

Genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the
small divided area that Vito uses as his office.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The 'patrone' is here.

				VITO
		Chi?

				GENCO
		Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

Vito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on
tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.

				ROBERTO
		Excuse me, I hope I am not a
		disturbance, Don Corleone.

				VITO
		Yes.

				ROBERTO
		What a terrible misunderstanding.
		Of course, Signora Colombo can stay
		in the flat.  Who were those
		miserable tenants to complain about
		noise from a poor animal...when
		they pay such low rent.

Then abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,
and steps back a respectful distance.

				ROBERTO
		Your good heart in helping the poor
		widow has shamed me, and I want to
		show that I, too, have some
		Christian charity.  Her rent will
		remain what it was.

				VITO
		What was that?

				ROBERTO
		In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!

Vito embraces him warmly.

				VITO
		I accept your generosity...

				ROBERTO
		I won't keep you another minute...

He quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then
makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,
deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned
too jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs
out of the warehouse.

Genco laughs as he watches.

				GENCO
		We won't see him for weeks!  He'll
		stay in bed in the Bronx!

Clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice
the subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no
longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an
imposing leader.

				CLEMENZA
		This kid is good with cars; he
		kiijed at the truck, and says he
		can keep it going.

Vito looks over the lanky young man.

				CLEMENZA
		What's your name?

				HYMAN
		Suchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.

				CLEMENZA
		He's gonna dump that; I call him
		Johnny Lips.

				VITO
		Who is the greatest man you can
		think of?

				CLEMENZA
		Go on, answer him when he talks to
		you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...
		Garibaldi.

				HYMAN
		Arnold Rothstein.

				VITO
		Then take that as your name: Hyman
		Rothstein.

Genco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.

				GENCO
		Vitone!  Look at this!

Vito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly
christened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.

EXT. THE ALLEY - DAY

Genco stands beaming, as two workers raise up high, the
freshly painted sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL COMPANY."

				GENCO
			(enthusiastically)
		God bless America!  We're in
		business!

The young men watch as the sign is hoisted into place.  OUR
VIEW goes from one to the other: Clemenza, Genco, Vito and
Hyman Rothstein.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Willy Cicci, Pentangeli's associate and bodyguard takes a
drink of water.

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to
		the present time, you were an
		employee of the "Genco Olive Oil
		Company."

				CICCI
		That's right.

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		But in actuality, you were a member
		of the Corleone Crime organization.

				CICCI
		The Corleone Family, Senator.  We
		called it, "The Family."

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		What position did you occupy?

				CICCI
		At first, like everybody, I was a
		soldier.

VIEW ON SENATOR KANE

A thin, angular Baptist with a Mid-Western accent.

				SENATOR KANE
		What is that exactly?

				CICCI
		A button.  You know, Senator.

				SENATOR KANE
		No, I don't know, explain that
		exactly.

				CICCI
		When the boss says push the button
		on a guy, I push the button, see,
		Senator?

The Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he
were a curious kind of animal, not really human.  Cicci
reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than
he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a
hypocrisy.

The VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's
attorney, Mr. Questadt.

				QUESTADT
		You mean you killed people at the
		behest of your superiors?

				CICCI
		That's right, counsellor.

				QUESTADT
		And the head of your family was
		Michael Corleone.

				CICCI
		Yeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone.

				SENATOR KANE
		Did you ever get such an order
		directly from Michael Corleone?

				CICCI
		No, Senator, I never talked to him.

				SENATOR SAVOY
			(very autocratic,
			deep South,
			gentlemanly man)
		There was always a buffer, someone
		in between you who gave you orders.

				CICCI
		Yeah, a buffer, the Family had a
		lot of buffers.

EXT. THE TROPICANA IN VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the
hotel.  Michael exits the limousine followed by Hagen and
Neri.

				MICHAEL
		Do you think they have somebody to
		back up Cicci?

				HAGEN
		No.  But if they do have somebody,
		you'll do three years for perjury
		if you give them so much as a wrong
		middle name.

Michael smiles to him, but it's a cold, deadly smile.

				HAGEN
		Michael, take the Fifth all the
		way, that way you can't get into
		trouble.

EXT. PRIVATE BALCONY OF CORLEONE APARTMENT AT TROPICANA - DAY

A Corleone bodyguard waits outside on the balcony overlooking
the pool area.  Through the translucent draperies, we see a
grouping of me.

INT. CORLEONE APARTMENT AT THE TROPICANA - DAY

Michael, Hagen, Neri and Rocco are seated in this luxury in
the hotel.  Michael sits in a comfortable chair in his
apartment.  Neri comes and brings him a drink without
asking, but Michael refuses it.

				MICHAEL
		Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay
		know I'm back?

Hagen nods.

				MICHAEL
		Did the boy get something from me
		for Christmas?

				HAGEN
		I took care of it.

				MICHAEL
		What was it, so I'll know.

				HAGEN
		A little care he can ride in with
		an electric motor.

Neri comes around with a wet face towel, which Michael uses
to cool his eyes.  He puts the used towel down on the table.

				MICHAEL
		Fellas, can you wait outside a
		minute?

They know what he means and leave the apartment, going out
to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear.
Only Hagen remains.

				MICHAEL
		Where's my brother?

				HAGEN
		Roth got out on a private boat.
		He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a
		stroke but he's recovered okay.
		Bussetta's dead.

				MICHAEL
		I asked about Fredo?

				HAGEN
		The new government arrested him,
		held him for a couple of days with
		a lot of the other casino people,
		including Roth's brother, Sam.  The
		American Embassy arranged flights
		for citizens; I'm not sure, but I
		think he's somewhere in New York.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to reach Fredo.  I know
		he's scared, but have one of our
		people reach him.  Assure him that
		there will be no reprisals.  Tell
		him that I know Roth misled him.

				HAGEN
		My information is that Fredo
		thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth
		assured him nothing would happen to
		you.

				MICHAEL
			(indicating Rocco and
			Neri on the balcony)
		They can come in now.

				HAGEN
		Wait... there's something else.

				MICHAEL
		Alright.

Hagen pauses; doesn't know how to begin.

				MICHAEL
			(impatiently)
		Go on, tell me.

				HAGEN
		Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the
		baby.

After a moment:

				MICHAEL
		Was it a boy or a girl?

				HAGEN
		Mike, at three and a half...

				MICHAEL
		What is it, can't you give me
		straight answers anymore!

				HAGEN
		It was a boy.

				MICHAEL
		And Kay...she's all right?

				HAGEN
		She took the Senate Investigation
		worse.

				MICHAEL
		Does she blame it on me?  The baby?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are
bare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras.
Michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar
sight of the home he has been forced to be away from.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the
estate it was warm, and the trees were full.

MOVING VIEW

approaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards
are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates
are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect,
as the car pulls in.

NEW VIEW

Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly
plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the
car as it passes.

The Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is
especially quiet.  Although there are signs that children
live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet
and with a rim of snow still on it.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY

to the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and
looks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children.

NEW VIEW

The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It
is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see
the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children
have been using, and left on a sofa or a table.

He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the
SOUND of a sewing machine running.

Quietly he opens the door.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

into the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the
cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She
hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with
her work.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

stands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And
then without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so
that she doesn't see him.

VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE

onto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he
moves to the house next to his own.

INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY

This is the house where Mama lives with Connie's children,
Connie so rarely is there.

He steps in; his mother is asleep in a chair in the living
room.  He moves to her, and bends low, whispers.

				MICHAEL
		Mom... Mom...

She opens her eyes, which are red and small with age.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		I'm alright.  Will you stay home
		for awhile?

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		There are still things I have to do.

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		Well, we can all have a nice dinner
		together tonight.  How are your eyes?

				MICHAEL
		Alright.  They bother me once in
		awhile.
			(a pause as he thinks)
		Tell me, when Pop had troubles...
		did he ever think, even to himself,
		that he had gone the wrong way;
		that maybe by trying to be strong
		and trying to protect his family,
		that he could... that he could...
		lose it instead?

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		You talk about the baby.  She can
		have another baby.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		No, I meant lose his family.

				MAMA
			(as best she ever
			understood it)
		Your family?  How can you ever lose
		your family?

				MICHAEL
			(almost to himself)
		But times are different...

FULL VIEW IN ROOM - MICHAEL AND HIS MOTHER

Quietly we HEAR the music of a small band playing an Italian
march.  From the orchestration, we know it is from the past.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TRAIN STATION AT CORLEONE - DAY

Vitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the
baby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by
friends, and Mama's relatives.  There is a small band,
playing for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor
car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men,
with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the
occasion.

The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on
the roof, and the car drives off.  The second car, with
bodyguards following.

EXT. DON TOMASINO'S VILLA OUTSIDE OF CORLEONE - DAY

The villa is bloomed with flowers and DON TOMASINO at this
point is a man in his late twenties.  He embraces Vitone and
pats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the
garden.

INT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY

A sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from
America.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and
children eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents
from Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given
to all of the children.

All typically American representing some of the prosperity
and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war.

EXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY

The family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito
shakes hands warmly with the priest.

INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT

The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room.
We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they
belong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD
MAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered
by mosquito netting.

VIEW ALTERS

and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN.

We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who
almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was
a boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the
mosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement
precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.

EXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW

Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil
Depot which is the link to his New York importing business.
They go inside.

INT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY

They are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and
rows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows
his associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used
in the United States.  They all stand around at the link to
their new importing business and share a toast of wine.

EXT. THE BAY - DAY

A team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets.
One sings accompanied by a guitar.

VIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN

He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted
Vito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a
figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels,
it is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old
man.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his
throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little
sound.

Then, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden
by the drying sails.

EXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY

We see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino.
Sitting in the car with him is Vito.

The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and
recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.

MED. VIEW

on an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his
early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as
ever, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the
power as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don
Tomasino is speaking.

We notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some
younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.

				TOMASINO
			(Sicilian)
		Don Francesco, if you will honor
		me, by allowing me to introduce my
		associate in America, in New York.
		His name is Vito Corleone.

The old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who
has taken the name of this town as his name.

				TOMASINO
		We will supply him with olive oil
		exclusively in the town of Corleone.
		His company is called the "Genco
		Olive Oil Company." Here we have
		brought you an indication of how he
		will sell the product.

Tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old
man can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion
of this business.

				TOMASINO
			(Sicilian)
		We have come to ask your blessing
		and permission to continue this
		enterprise.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
			 (in a shrill, high,
			raspy voice)
		Where is this young man?

				TOMASINO
		He is right here, standing next to
		me, Don Francesco.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		Have him come closer, I can't see
		very well.

Vito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right
in front of the old man.

VIEW ON DON FRANCESCO

looking up, squinting against the sun.

DON FRANCESCO'S VIEW

Strangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from
America.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		What is your name?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Vito Corleone.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		You took the name of this town, eh?
		What was your father's name?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Antonio Andolini.

CLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN

The recognition of the name throws a shudder through him.
It is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son
of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had
tried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands
signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		Kill him!  Kill him!

But he is too late; Vito steps forward.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		In the name of my Father, and my
		Brother...

And uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old
man's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.

VIEW ON TOMASINO

has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards,
helping Vito to escape back into the motor car.

VIEW ON A GUARD

raising his shotgun.

VIEW ON THE MOTOR CAR

Just as Tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun
is fired, and he is hit in the legs.

Vito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make
their escape.

EXT. RAILROAD STATION IN CORLEONE - DAY

Some of the townspeople have come bringing flowers and gifts
for Vito and his family.

His wife is radiant with the flowers given her.

The train has arrived and the crowd shout "Ciao, come back
soon."

THE VIEW ALTERS

revealing his good friend Tomasino, waving from his
wheelchair.

VIEW ON VITO

and his wife.  She holds up the baby Michael, and helps him
wave his hand.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

				SENATOR KANE (O.S.)
		Are you the son of Vito Corleone?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				SENATOR KING
		Did he use at times an alias?  Was
		this alias in certain circles
		GODFATHER?

				MICHAEL
		It was not an alias.  GODFATHER was
		a term of affection, used by his
		friends, one of respect.

				SENATOR WEEKLER
			(Senator from New
			York, very smooth,
			partly liberal,
			Tammany Hall)
		Let me agree with that.  Many of my
		constituents are Italian and have
		been honored with that certain
		friendship by my close Italian
		friends.  Up to this point before I
		have to leave this hearing to join
		my own committee, let me say, that
		this hearing on the Mafia is in no
		way a slur on the Italians by the
		Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor
		will I allow it to be.  Italian
		Americans are the hardest working,
		most law abiding patriotic Americans
		of our country.  It is a shame and
		a pity that a few rotten apples
		give them a bad name.  We are here
		to weed those rotten apples out of
		the vast healthy barrel of Italian
		Americans, who are one of the
		backbones of our country.

There is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator
poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he
will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.

				SENATOR KANE
		I'm sure we all agree with our
		esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.
		Corleone, you have been advised as
		to your legal rights.  We have had
		testimony from a preceding witness
		who states you are head of the most
		powerful Mafia family in this
		country.  Are you?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				SENATOR KANE
		This witness has testified that you
		are personally responsible for the
		murder of a New York Police Captain
		in the year 1947 and with him a man
		named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny
		this?

				MICHAEL
		I deny his every charge.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is it true that in the year 1950
		you devised the murder of the heads
		of the Five Families in New York,
		to assume and consolidate your
		nefarious power?

				MICHAEL
		That is a complete falsehood.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is it true that you own a
		controlling interest in three of
		the major hotels in Las Vegas?

				MICHAEL
		That is not true.  I own some stock
		in some of the hotels, but only
		very small amounts.  I also own
		some American Telephone and IBM
		stock.

Michael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering,
and then once again after the answer.

				SENATOR ROGERS
		Why is it necessary for your
		counsel to advise you on that
		question?

				MICHAEL
		Senator, I've observed the head of
		General Motors before a Senate
		Committee, and his lawyer whispered
		in his ear.  That was not commented
		upon in the way you have just done.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel
		interests in the state of Arizona?
		Or any gambling interests in that
		state?

				MICHAEL
		I do not.

				SENATOR KANE
		Do you have interests or control
		over gambling and narcotics in the
		state of New York.

				MICHAEL
		I do not.

A pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his
assistant.

Tom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses
the Chair.

				HAGEN
		Senator, my client would like to
		read a statement for the record.

				SENATOR KANE
		I don't think that's necessary.

				HAGEN
		Sir, my client has answered every
		question asked by this committee
		with the utmost cooperation and
		sincerity.  He has not taken that
		Fifth Amendment as it was his right
		to do, and which because of the
		extreme legal complexity of this
		hearing, counsel advised him to do.
		So, I think in all fairness this
		committee should hear his statement
		and put it in the record.

				SENATOR KANE
		Very well.

At this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the
hearing room.

				MICHAEL
			(reading)
		In the hopes of clearing my family
		name, in the sincere desire to give
		my children their fair share of the
		American way of life without a
		blemish on their name and background
		I have appeared before this
		committee and given it all the
		cooperation in my power.  I consider
		my being called before this
		committee an act of prejudice to
		all Americans of Italian extraction.
		I consider it a great dishonor to
		me personally to have to deny that
		I am a criminal.  I wish to have
		the following noted for the record.
		That I served my country faithfully
		and honorably in World War II and
		was awarded the Distinguished
		Service Cross for actions in
		defense of my country.  That I have
		never been arrested or indicted for
		any crime whatsoever... that no
		proof linking me to any criminal
		conspiracy, whether it is called
		Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever
		other name you wish to give, has
		ever been made public.  Only one
		man has made charges against me,
		and that man is known to be a
		murderer, arsonist and rapist.  And
		yet this committee had used this
		person to besmirch my name.  My
		personal protest can only be made
		to the people of this country.  I
		can only thank God that in this
		country we have a legal system and
		courts of law to protect innocent
		people from wild accusation.  I
		thank God for our democratic due
		process of Law that shields me from
		the false charges made by this
		committee's witness.  I have not
		taken refuge behind the Fifth
		Amendment, though counsel advised
		me to do so.  I challenge this
		committee to produce any witness or
		evidence against me, and if they do
		not, I hope they will have the
		decency to clear my name with the
		same publicity with which they have
		now besmirched it.  I ask this
		without malice, in the interests of
		fair play.

The television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen
hands the document over to the committee lawyer.

				SENATOR ROGERS
		We are all impressed.  The committee
		will now recess over the weekend.
		However, it will continue Monday
		morning, at eleven a.m.  At that
		time, this committee will then
		produce a witness directly linking
		Mr. Corleone to the charges we have
		made.  And then, Mr. Corleone may
		very well by liable for indictments
		of perjury.  However, this document
		will be made a matter of record.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

An army post somewhere in the East.  It is safely guarded.

INT. HOUSE ON THE POST - DAY

where Pentangeli is being held by his constant companions,
the two FBI MEN.

				PENTANGELI
		Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to
		one shot in my favor, and I lose.

				FBI MAN #1
		Get a good night's sleep.  We got a
		new suit, new shirt, new tie, and
		I'm going to shave you myself.
		Tomorrow we want you to look
		respectable for fifty million of
		your fellow Americans.

				PENTANGELI
		My life won't be worth a nickel
		after tomorrow.

				FBI MAN #1
		We have a special home for you for
		the rest of your life.  Nobody gets
		near you.  You're not going any
		place.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, some deal I made.

				FBI MAN #2
		You live like a king.  You'll be a
		hero.  You'll live better in here
		than most people on the outside.

				PENTANGELI
		Some deal.
			(pause)
		I just wish Mike had took the Fifth.

				FBI MAN #1
		Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After
		all these years, why'd you turn
		against him?

				PENTANGELI
		I didn't turn against nobody; he
		turned against me.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE ALCOVE - DAY

A somewhat frightened Fredo Corleone sits in the easy chair
overlooking the lake in this canopied section of the
boathouse.  Rocco sits with him.

INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael is in the dark room with Hagen and Neri.

				MICHAEL
		How did they get their hands on
		Pentangeli?

				HAGEN
		Roth engineered it, Michael.  He
		made Pentangeli think you hit him.
		Deliberately letting him get off
		alive.  Then the New York detectives
		turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My
		informants say he was half dead and
		scared stiff -- talking out loud
		that you had turned on him and
		tried to kill him.  Anyway, they
		had him on possession, dealing in
		heroin, murder one and a lot more.
		There's no way we can get to him
		and you've opened yourself to five
		points of perjury.

				NERI
		They've got him airtight.  He's in
		a military base, twenty-four hour
		guards.  Trying to kill him is like
		trying to like the President --
		it's impossible.

				MICHAEL
		What does Fredo know?

				HAGEN
		He says he doesn't know anything,
		and I believe him.  Roth played
		this one beautifully.

				MICHAEL
		Alright.  I'm going to go outside
		and talk to Fredo.

EXT. BOATHOUSE FOYER - DAY

Fredo sits on the couch.  When Rocco sees Michael, he
automatically takes his leave.  Michael sits in the chair
opposite Fredo.

				FREDO
			(after a pause)
		I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We have time.

				FREDO
		I was kept pretty much in the dark.
		I didn't know all that much.

				MICHAEL
		What about now, is there anything
		you can help me out with?

				FREDO
		I know they get Pentangeli, that's
		all I know.

Fredo gets up, walks to the glass panel that separates the
terrace from the lake.

				FREDO
		I didn't know it was a hit.  I
		swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny
		Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills --
		said he wanted to talk.  He said
		you and Roth were in on some big
		deal, and there was a place for me
		in it if I could help them out.
		They said you were being tough on
		the negotiation, and if they had a
		little bit of help, they could
		close it fast and it would be good
		for you.

				MICHAEL
		And you believed that story.

				FREDO
		He said there was something good in
		it for me...me on my own.

				MICHAEL
		I've always taken care of you.

				FREDO
		Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my
		kid brother, and you take care of
		my.  Did you ever think of that.
		Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do
		this, send Fredo to take care of
		that... take care of some little
		unimportant night club here, and
		there; pick somebody up at the
		airport.  Mike, I'm your older
		brother; I was stepped over!

				MICHAEL
		It's the way Pop wanted it.

				FREDO
		It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I
		can handle things.  I'm not dumb
		Christ, not like everyone says.
		I'm smart; and I want respect.

				MICHAEL
		There's nothing more you can tell
		me about this investigation?

				FREDO
		The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to
		Roth.

				MICHAEL
		You're nothing to me now, Fredo;
		not a brother, not a friend, I
		don't want to know you, or what
		happens to you.  I don't want to
		see you at the hotels, or near my
		home.  When you visit our Mother, I
		want to know a day in advance, so I
		won't be there.  Do you understand?

Michael turns, and starts to leave.  A frightened voice
behind him:

				FREDO
		Mikey?

Michael doesn't stop, doesn't turn back.  He continues off
through the veranda, and out the summer doors.

Neri stops by him.

				MICHAEL
		I don't want anything to happen to
		him while my Mother's alive.

Michael leaves.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

Five cars brimming with Army guards and Agents are waiting
to move Pentangeli.  There is one empty car.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The two FBI Agents are helping Pentangeli get dressed.  He's
in brightly colored striped shorts and bare-chested.  The
Agents help him with the shirt and tie.  One holds out the
trousers but Pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in
the mirror.

				FBI MAN #1
		Ready, Frankie.

				PENTANGELI
		Let's go.

The Agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the
area.  They check the cars waiting, each with two Agents.
They check the gate and note the military sentries.  Then
they stand aside, and let Pentangeli come out.  They get
close to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his
life with their own.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

The Agents put him in the front seat of the empty car, and
get in with him, one at each side.  Another Agent drives.
Now, the first cars start out; the Sentries opening the
gates, and letting the caravan pass.

An Army supply truck comes very close to them, and the
Agents next to Pentangeli become very tense.  Pentangeli
grins.  Then the truck passes on, and they relax.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

The room is crowded with TV journalists, cameras, etc.  We
pick Pentangeli up, closely guarded, being led to witness
chair.

Pentangeli is seated, and made to take his oath.  FBI Agents
are all around him.

MED. VIEW

Anyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked.
The five Senators take their places.

VIEW ON HAGEN

waiting at his long table, very nervous.  He seems startled
by the appearance of Pentangeli.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

catching Hagen's eye.  It's as though he is pleading for
some kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a
traitor.

VIEW ON HAGEN

cold; then he turns away.

VIEW ON THE ENTRANCE

The bustle is settling down; then Michael Corleone enters,
and with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for
this setting.  A burly-chested imposing man of middle age.
Very powerful-looking with frightening magnetic eyes.  His
dress is odd: boots, rough tie, and shirt.  He could be the
tenor out of a Sicilian opera.  He is clearly a country Don,
direct from Sicily, and he dominates the room.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

At first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a
bit shamefaced, but still defiant.

PENTANGELI'S POV

Michael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the Sicilian.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man.

VIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE

Michael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare
directly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear.

VIEW ON THE SENATOR

Notices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences:

				SENATOR KANE
		We have here a witness who will
		testify further on Michael
		Corleone's rule of the criminal
		empire that controls gambling in
		this country and perhaps in other
		countries.  This witness had no
		buffer between himself and Michael
		Corleone.  He can corroborate our
		charges on enough counts for this
		committee to consider a charge of
		perjury against Michael Corleone.
			(then he turns to Pentangeli)
		Your name please, for the record.

				PENTANGELI
		Frank Pentangeli.

				SENATOR KANE
		Were you a member of the Corleone
		Family?  Were you under the
		Caporegime Peter Clemenza, under
		Vito Corleone, known as the
		Godfather?

There is a long silence.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He seems unable to speak.

VIEW ON THE SICILIAN

gazing at him.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

				PENTANGELI
		I never knew no Godfather.  I got
		my own family.

Senator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their
eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their
witness at the last moment.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Pentangeli, you are
		contradicting your confessions to
		our investigators; I ask you again,
		were you a member of a crime
		organization headed by Michael
		Corleone?

				PENTANGELI
		No.  I never heard of it.  I never
		heard of nothing like that.  I was
		in the olive oil business with his
		father a long time ago.  That's all.

				SENATOR KANE
		We have your confession that you
		murdered on the orders of Michael
		Corleone.  Do you deny that
		confession and do you know what
		denying that confession will mean
		to you?

The die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go
all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the
Senator.

				PENTANGELI
		The FBI guys promised me a deal.
		So I made up a lot of stuff about
		Michael Corleone.  Because then,
		that's what they wanted.  But it
		was all lies.  Everything.  They
		said Michael Corleone did this,
		Michael Corleone did that.  So I
		said, "Yeah, sure."

He makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of
everybody.

VIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS

glancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the
Sicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper,
and passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes
to Senator Kane.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify
		to this committee that gentleman
		sitting on your right hand?

				HAGEN
			(coolly)
		Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo
		Pentangeli.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is he related to the witness?

				HAGEN
		He is, I believe, a brother.

VIEW ON MICHAEL AND VINCENZO PENTANGELI

They wait with no expression.

				SENATOR KANE
			(to Vincenzo Pentangeli)
		Sir, I would like you to take the
		stand.

Vincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending.  There may just be
a shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer.

				HAGEN
		Sir, the gentleman does not
		understand English.  He would not
		in any case, take the stand.  He
		came, at his own expense, to aid
		his brother in his trouble.  He is
		not under any jurisdiction of our
		government and his reputation in
		his own country is impeccable.

				SENATOR KANE
			(furious)
		The witness is excused; take him out.

The guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as
everybody else in the room is required to sit still.

				HAGEN
		Senator Kane.

				SENATOR KANE
		This meeting is adjourned.

				HAGEN
			(rising and shouting)
		This committee owes an apology!

				SENATOR KANE
		The committee is adjourned until
		further notice.

For the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen
smiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

The modest champion.  He rises and they take their leave.

VIEW ON THE TWO FBI AGENTS

They watch the Corleone party as they exit.

INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The Corleone nurse is waiting, playing with the little girl
MARY.  A distance away, the boy, Anthony, is standing by
himself.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - WASHINGTON HOTEL - DAY

The door to Michael's suite opens; Rocco leans in.

				ROCCO
		It's Kay.

Michael is sitting in an easy chair; he seems to have
difficulty with his eyes.

				MICHAEL
		On the phone?

				ROCCO
		No, she's here.

Michael rises, surprised.  Rocco steps back, and Kay enters.

				MICHAEL
		I had no idea...

				KAY
		I wanted to see you before you went
		back to Nevada.  Also, the
		children - Michael, they're here.

				MICHAEL
		Where?

				KAY
		In a minute.  They're outside with
		Esther.  I'm very happy for you...
		I suppose I knew that you're simply
		too smart for anyone ever to beat
		you.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you sit down?

				KAY
		I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

				MICHAEL
		There are a lot of things I want to
		talk to you about.  Things I've
		been thinking about -- changes I
		want to make.

				KAY
		I think it's too late for changes,
		Michael.  I promised myself I
		wouldn't talk about it and I've
		gone and spoiled it.

				MICHAEL
		Why too late?

				KAY
		Tell me, Michael.  What really
		happened with Pentangeli?

				MICHAEL
		His brother came to help him.

				KAY
		I didn't even know he had a brother.
		And where is he now?

				MICHAEL
		On a plane back to Sicily.

				KAY
		And that's all he had to do.  Just
		show his face.

				MICHAEL
		That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in
		the old days... there was only one
		legitimate reason to kill a blood
		relative... only one.  IF he was a
		traitor.

				KAY
		You would have killed his brother?

				MICHAEL
		Kay, you've got it wrong.  That
		kind of thing's all over, I promised
		you.  This was between the two
		brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a
		young girlfriend; he called her his
		co-wife.  That was his joke, but he
		meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his
		wife... because she was a great
		cook.  He said he girlfriend made a
		spaghetti sauce once and it was so
		terrible he knew he could never
		marry her.  He set her up in a
		house in Jersey.  She had to be
		faithful... and she had to have kids.
		And she did, two, a boy and a girl.
		He had her checked out and watched
		so she couldn't cheat... but the
		girl couldn't stand that kind of
		life.  She begged him to let her go.
		He did.  He gave her money and made
		her give up the kids.  Then Frankie
		took them to Italy, and had them
		brought up by his brother Vincenzo.
		Where he knew they'd by safe.

Kay begins to realize.

				MICHAEL
		When he saw his brother in the
		hearing room, he knew what was at
		stake.
			(pause)
		I don't think Vincenzo would have
		done it.  He loves the kids, too.
		Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It
		had nothing to do with me.  It was
		between those brothers.

				KAY
		I'll bring the children up now;
		they want to say goodbye.

				MICHAEL
		Kay, I told you...

				KAY
		Goodbye, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I won't let you leave!  Christ, do
		you think I'm going to let you leave.

				KAY
			(meekly)
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		No, I don't want to hear anything.
		There are things between men and
		women that will not change; things
		that have been the same for
		thousands of years.  You are my
		wife, and they are my children...
		and I love you and I will not let
		you leave, because you are MINE!

				KAY
		Oh, I do feel things for you,
		Michael; but now, I think it's pity.
		For the first time since I've known
		you, you seem so helpless.  You
		held me a prisoner once; will you
		try again?

				MICHAEL
		If that's what it takes; then yes,
		I will.

				KAY
		At this moment, I feel no love for
		you at all.  I never thought that
		could happen, but it has.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go back tonight.  Bring the
		children.

				KAY
		You haven't heard me.

He moves to her; he does love her, and is tender with her.

				MICHAEL
		How can I let you leave; how can I
		let you take my children away?
		Don't you know me?  You understand,
		it's an impossibility.  I would
		never let it happen; no, never, not
		if it took all my strength, all my
		cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll
		feel differently.  You see, you'll
		be happy that I stopped you.  I
		know you.  You'll forget about
		this; you'll forget about the baby
		we lost... and we'll go on, you and
		I.

				KAY
		The baby I lost...

				MICHAEL
		I know what it meant... and I'm
		prepared to make it up to you.  I
		will make changes; I can.
			(he clenches his fist tightly)
		I CAN change; that I have learned,
		that I have the strength to change...
		And we have another child, a boy...
		and you'll forget the miscarriage.

				KAY
		It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you
		with your cunning, couldn't you
		figure it out!  It was an abortion;
		an abortion, like our marriage is
		an abortion, something unholy and
		evil.  I don't want your son; I
		wouldn't bring another of your sons
		into this world.  An abortion,
		Michael... it was a son, and I had
		it killed, but this must all end!

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He had no hint, not in his wildest imagination could he have
guessed that she would do such a thing.

				KAY
		And I know that now it's over; I
		knew it then, there would be no way
		you could ever forgive me, not with
		this Sicilian thing that goes back
		two thousand years.

He is silent, though raging -- then, with all his passion,
and his strength, he raises his arms, and strikes her across
her neck, literally knocking her down to the floor, and
hurting her badly.

				MICHAEL
			(coldly)
		You won't take my children.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. THE CORLEONE ESTATE AT TAHOE - FULL VIEW - DAY

A collection of dark cars and black limousines are gathered
to one side.  A few drivers wait quietly.

And then, to the other extreme of the estate, is a small
grouping of about twenty to thirty people, gathered near
Michael's house.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Connie Corleone, dressed simply and now showing her age
without the carefully applied makeup which we have been used
to, kneels down before the shrine of Santa Theresa, and puts
down a bouquet of flowers, along with others that have been
placed there.  We see that some have the simple silk ribbon
with the word "Mama" hand-lettered upon it.

Her two children stand close behind her; they had been
raised by their Grandmother.

Connie steps back, and moves through the small group of
friends and relatives, into Michael's house.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - CONNIE'S VIEW - DAY

Fredo, kneeling by the coffin of his mother in a portion of
the house that has been set aside for the wake.  Fredo
concludes his prayer, wipes away the tears in his eyes and
steps away from the coffin.

He stops when he notices Neri, a little distance away,
looking at him.

VIEW ON NERI

After a moment, he nods respectfully to Fredo, and steps
forward, moving to the old woman's coffin.  Fredo moves to
Hagen, who is there with his wife and children.

				FREDO
		Tom.  Where's Mike?

				HAGEN
			(difficult to tell him)
		He's waiting for you to leave.

				FREDO
		Can I talk to him?

				HAGEN
		No chance.  I'm sorry, Freddie.

				CONNIE
			(who has heard this)
		Can I see him?

				HAGEN
		He's in the boathouse.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael sits quietly in the darkened room in one of the big
sofas, dressed immaculately in suit and tie.  His two
children, also dressed for the wake sit opposite him in the
other oversized sofa, their shoes not touching the floor.
We regard this tableau for a long moment.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
			(quietly)
		Michael?  It's Connie.

She comes in, and sits down by his knees.

				CONNIE
		I want to stay close to home now,
		is that alright?

Michael nods.

				CONNIE
		Is Kay coming?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				CONNIE
		Michael, Fredo's in the house with
		Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom
		said he couldn't see you.

				MICHAEL
		Tom is right.

				CONNIE
		Kids, why don't you go outside for
		a while?

The children don't move; Connie realizes they will only
listen to Michael.

				CONNIE
		I want to talk to you, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		The children can stay.

				CONNIE
		I hated you for so long, Michael;
		for so many years.  I think I did
		things to myself, to hurt myself,
		so that you would know -- and you
		would be hurt too.  But I understand
		you now; I think I do.  You were
		being strong for all of us, like
		Papa was.  And I forgive you, and
		want to be close to you now.  Can't
		you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet,
		and helpless without you.

Slowly, Michael puts his hand on her hair, and touches her
gently.

				CONNIE
		You need me, Michael.  I want to be
		with you now.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

Friends, relatives; Francesca and her new husband, Gardner
and their baby; Sandra Corleone; Teresa, her children; all
the familiar faces of the family are present, quietly paying
their respects to Mama.

Some of the men can be seen in the kitchen, drinking wine,
and talking in low voices.

Fredo is there, broken-hearted over the loss of his Mother;
like some lost child with no friends.

MED. VIEW

Michael enters the room, followed by Connie, who tends
little Mary and Anthony.

He approaches his brother, and then embraces.  Fredo breaks
into tears.

				FREDO
		Christ, Mike.  Jesus Christ, Mike.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

embracing his brother, he glances up.

VIEW ON NERI

quiet, and deadly.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Tom Hagen is talking in the distance to his wife, and one of
his older sons; he kisses, and moves toward the boathouse.
After crossing the lawn, he stops.

VIEW ON SANDRA CORLEONE

waiting there; obviously wanting to talk to him.  He
continues, and she walks with him.

MOVING VIEW ON THE TWO

as they cross toward the boathouse.

				SANDRA
		You're going to talk to him now.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				SANDRA
		Will you tell him?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.

She stops him.

				SANDRA
		Tom, think of yourself for once.
		Don't let this opportunity slip
		through your fingers; don't do it.
		We're all trapped here, don't you
		see?

He continues past her, without answering her.  Continues up
to the boathouse.  He stops before he enters.

HAGEN'S VIEW

Fredo is sitting by the edge of the harbor with Michael's
son Anthony; he is helping him with some fishing rig.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

looking through the window at his son and brother.  Neri
sits in the room, dressed informally.

				MICHAEL
			(without looking back)
		Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard
		about our friend and partner, Mr.
		Hyman Roth?

				HAGEN
		I know he's in Israel.

				NERI
			(hands Hagen the paper)
		The High Court of Israel turned
		down his request to live as a
		'returned Jew.' His passport's been
		invalidated except for return to
		the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires
		yesterday, offered a gift of one
		million dollars if they would give
		him citizenship.  They turned him
		down.

				HAGEN
			(reading)
		He's going to try Panama...

				MICHAEL
		They won't take him; not for a
		million, not for ten million.

				HAGEN
		His medical condition is reported
		as... "terminal."

				MICHAEL
		He's been dying of the same heart
		attack for twenty years.

				HAGEN
		That plane goes to Miami...

				MICHAEL
		I want it met.

				HAGEN
			(understanding)
		Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be
		met by the Internal Revenue; the
		Customs Service, and half the FBI.

				MICHAEL
		I don't like it when you use the
		word impossible; nothing is
		impossible...

				HAGEN
		Mike, it would be like trying to
		kill the President; there's no way
		we can get to him.

				MICHAEL
		I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If
		there's anything certain; certain
		in life; if history has taught us
		anything, it's that you can kill...
			(he stops, then coldly)
		ANYBODY.  But perhaps your
		relucatance is because you've come
		to tell me that you're moving your
		family to Vegas, that you've been
		offered the Vice-Presidency of the
		Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't
		you going to tell me at all?

				HAGEN
		Are you so hungry for traitors; do
		you want to find them everywhere?

				MICHAEL
		They are everywhere!

				HAGEN
		I turned Houstan down; I didn't see
		why I should tell you about an
		offer I turned down.
			(Michael begins to
			confuse him)
		Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure
		of what we're doing; what we'll
		gain; what does the family gain?
		Forget that, Mike; I already know
		the answer.

				MICHAEL
		I know you do, Tom.  Then I can
		count on you to help me do the
		things I have to do.  If not, call
		Houstan, and become a Vice-President.
		Take your family and your mistress
		and move them to Las Vegas.

				HAGEN
		Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've
		always been loyal to you.

				MICHAEL
		Good.  Then you're staying.

				HAGEN
		I'm staying.
			(he pauses...then,
			without being asked)
		Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of
		all this; Sonny never listened to
		me about that.
			(then he sits down,
			and opens his briefcase)
		Now, explain everything to me.

EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

Fredo sits with Anthony, with a silly-looking fishing hat on
his head, covered with lure and flies.

				FREDO
		Anthony, ole buddy, your Uncle
		Fredo's gonna teach you how to
		catch the big fish.  You know, when
		I was a kid, I did this amazing
		thing.  I went out on a fishing
		trip; me and my brothers and my
		Pop, and no one could catch a fish
		except me.  And this was my secret:
			(confidentially)
		Every time I would put the line
		down I would say a "Hail Mary" and
		every time I said a "Hail Mary" I
		would catch a fish.  Now, when it's
		sunset, we're gonna go out on the
		lake, and we're gonna try it.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The guards step aside as Tom Hagen enters the foyer of the
house.  He shows a court order to them and they lead him up
the stairs where he knocks on the door.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

There is a KNOCK at the door.  The two guards show Hagen in
and Hagen presents the court order to one of the FBI men.

				HAGEN
		I think I prefer to see my client
		privately.

				PENTANGELI
		The room has a bug in it.

				HAGEN
			(to the FBI men)
		I'd like to go outside with him, in
		the open air.

				FBI MAN #1
		This room is not bugged.

				HAGEN
		You have guards outside and the
		electric fence.  There's no security
		reason for not letting us talk in
		the yard.

				FBI MAN #1
		Okay.

They pass out of the room.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen and Pentangeli outside, by the electric fence.  They
cannot be overheard.  Pentangeli takes out some cigars and
offers Hagen one.  Hagen takes it and Pentangeli lights both
their cigars.  They puff on them contentedly.  They are
comfortable together, almost.

				HAGEN
		Everything is going to be okay,
		Frankie, don't worry.

				PENTANGELI
		Did my brother go back?

				HAGEN
		Yeah, but don't worry.

				PENTANGELI
		He's ten times tougher than me, my
		brother.  He's old-fashioned.

				HAGEN
		Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to
		dinner.  Just wanted to go home.

				PENTANGELI
		That's my brother.  Nothing could
		get him away from that two mule
		town.  He coulda been big over
		here -- he could of had his own
		Family.

				HAGEN
		You're right.

				PENTANGELI
		Tom, what do I do now?

The light is beginning to turn reddish as the sun falls.

				HAGEN
		Frankie, you were always interested
		in politics, in history.  I remember
		you talking about Hitler back in
		'43.  We were young then.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, I still read a lot.  They
		bring me stuff.

				HAGEN
		You were around the old timers who
		dreamed up how the Families should
		be organized, how they based it on
		the old Roman Legions, and called
		them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos'
		and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, it worked.  Those were great
		old days.  We was like the Roman
		Empire.  The Corleone family was
		like the Roman Empire.

				HAGEN
			(sadly)
		Yeah, it was once.

They both puff on their cigars.  Pentangeli lets himself be
carried away by thoughts of old days of glory; Hagen thinks
of other days too.

				HAGEN
			(very gently)
		The Roman Empire... when a plot
		against the Emperor failed, the
		plotters were always given a chance
		to let their families keep their
		fortunes.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The
		little guys got knocked off.  If
		they got arrested and executed, all
		their estate went to the Emperor.
		If they just went home and killed
		themselves, up front, nothing
		happened.

				HAGEN
		Yeah, that was a good break.  A
		nice deal.

Pentangeli looks at Hagen; he understands.

				PENTANGELI
		They went home and sat in a hot
		bath and opened their veins, and
		bled to death.  Sometimes they gave
		a little party before they did it.

Hagen throws away his cigar.  Pentangeli puffs on his.

				HAGEN
		Don't worry about anything, Frankie
		Five-Angels.

				PENTANGELI
		Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.

They shake hands.  The FBI Agents come out to let Hagen out
the gate.  Pentangeli is led back to the house.

				FBI MAN #1
		Your lawyer tell you he can get
		that 600 years reduced to 500?

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and reflects.

				PENTANGELI
		You boys sure you can't get me a
		broad for tonight?  Give me a
		little party?

				FBI MAN #2
		We got some nice books.

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and gives the Agent a smile an
old man gives a child.  He starts upstairs.

				PENTANGELI
		I guess I'll just take a hot bath.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen walks away; glances back.  Then gets into his waiting
car and drives off.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - FULL VIEW - SUNSET

Michael sits alone in the empty boathouse; in the shadows.

INT. BOAT DOCK - SUNSET

Neri stands by the dock area under the boathouse.  He pushes
the button which lowers a boat by winch and tackle.  He
wears a fishing cap.

He steps into the boat, and pulls the small outboard, which
glides the boat out into the harbor.

MED. VIEW

The boat pulls up alongside Fredo and Anthony.

				FREDO
		Here we go; and remember the secret.

He lifts Anthony into the boat.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Anthony.

THEIR VIEW

Connie, in houseclothes, is calling Anthony.

				FREDO
		He's here; we're goin' fishing.

				CONNIE
		He can't go; Michael wants to take
		him into Reno.

				FREDO
		Ah.  Okay, kid, you got to go to
		Reno with your Pop.

He lifts the boy out of the boat, and puts him on the shore.

				FREDO
		I'll catch one for you, with the
		secret.

				CONNIE
		Hurry, Anthony.

Neri stands the motor; and the boat with the two fisherman
glides off.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

watching, from the dark window of the boathouse.

INT. HIGH SECURITY HOUSE IN ARMY POST - NIGHT

The FBI man knocks on the bathroom door in the house where
they have kept Pentangeli.

				FBI MAN #1
		Frankie, open up.  You okay?

No answer; he hammers on the door.  Using his elbow, and
then a kick he breaks into the bathroom.

HIS VIEW

Pentangeli lying in a tub of water.  His stomach shows above
it.  His wrists are cut and covered with blood.  The bath
water has a purplish tone.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE TAHOE - MED. VIEW - SUNSET

Fredo and Neri are fishing, each with lines out.  The VIEW
MOVES CLOSER, and we can hear Fredo as he holds the pole.

		art thou amongst women, and blessed
		is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

LONG SHOT

The boat on the shimmery lake.

INT. MIAMI AIRPORT - NIGHT

An exhausted Hyman Roth, ill-shaven, and in shirt-sleeves in
taken into custody by a swarm of Customs, and FBI men.  They
allow him to be photographed by press people; and television
cameramen.

				FBI MAN
		Mr. Roth, we have to take you into
		custody.

				ROTH
		Yes, I know.

Some flashbulbs go off.

				REPORTER
		Can you give us your reaction to
		the High Court of Israel's ruling.

				ROTH
		I am a retired investor on a
		pension, and I wished to live there
		as a Jew  in the twilight of my
		life...

				LAWYER
		Mr. Roth is not a well man; he's
		tired of running.

				ROTH
		I'm an old man; at my age, it's too
		late to start worrying.

				REPORTER
		Is it true you are worth over three
		hundred million dollars, Mr. Roth?

				ROTH
		I'm a retired investor, living on a
		pension... I came home to vote in
		the Presidential election, because
		they wouldn't give me an absentee
		ballot...

The newsmen and photographers all laugh, as the FBI men move
him away.

CLOSE VIEW

One of the newspapermen laughing we recognize to be Rocco
Lampone.

He moves closer to Roth, and shoves his revolver right
against his head, and in a second, on camera, assassinates
Roth.  People scream, as Rocco attempts to run down the
airport corridor, limping as he does.

FBI men easily pick him off.

							FADE OUT.

EXT. THE DRIVEWAY BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

A taxi cab waits by the house; its driver sleeping with a
newspaper over his face.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

The cleaning woman, Esther, who had been with Kay for years,
sits by the dining room table, weeping profusely.  Behind
her, in the recreation room, we can see the tableau of Kay
sitting on the couch, her little daughter Mary, between her
knees, talking quietly about things we cannot hear.  Her son
Anthony sits by himself, in another chair by the side of the
room.

MED. VIEW

Connie comes into the house quickly, and moves toward them.

				CONNIE
		Kay, you have to go.

This prompts Esther to weep all the more.  Kay hugs her
daughter, and kisses her many times.

				CONNIE
		You have to hurry; he's coming.

Kay puts her coat on; then stands, and reaches out for her
son.

				KAY
		Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye.

He doesn't move.

				CONNIE
			(angrily)
		Anthony, you kiss your Mother
		goodbye!

He rises, and walks to her.  Hugs her lifelessly.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on Kay, kissing her boy.

				KAY
		Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama

				ANTHONY
		Goodbye.

She restrains any tears; she has become too strong for tears.
Kay starts to go; picks up Mary, kisses her, and starts to go.

NEW VIEW

She steps out the kitchen door; then she cannot help herself.
Crouches down, outside, and calls to her son.

				KAY
		Anthony, kiss me once.

Then she looks up, and slowly rises.

HER VIEW

Michael has stepped into the dining room.  He seems older
somehow; as though some sickness has taken more years away
from him.

VIEW ON KAY

looks at him; instinctively, she takes a step back.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

slowly steps toward her.

Another step back; the door is still open.

He moves closer to the door; stops, looks at her.  And then
closes it obscuring any view of her.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

It is late fall -- most of the leaves have fallen on the
grounds and there is quite a wind.

MED. VIEW

The water is whipped up by the wind, and the waves are high
as they break against the pavilion.  We HEAR the MUSIC of
time passing, of Michael, of the Godfather over these images.

VIEW ON THE SWIMMING POOLS

They have not been used in several months; they are drained
and the bottoms are mossy and dark.

VIEW ON THE MAIN GATE

Leaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a
hint of someone in the gatehouse.

VIEW ON THE HOUSES

Some of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down,
and put away.  Some of the windows have been boarded up.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

There are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving
impatiently.

As the MUSIC concludes its statement.

MED. VIEW

The peninsula of the private Corleone Harbor.  We see the
figures of two people, seated at a table.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is
attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest
person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the
way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into
the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than
his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its
toll.

				CONNIE
		Don't worry; I'm sure he got here
		on time.  The roads from the
		airport are so windy, it takes
		forever; I've driven them myself.

She picks up some of the serving plates that he has left
untouched.

				CONNIE
		I'll bring him out to you as soon
		as he comes.

She moves back to the main house.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a
moment.  He slowly takes a sip of wine.

EXT. A PLACE IN THE GARDEN - DAY

There are a few chairs.

MED. VIEW ON ANTHONY CORLEONE

He is eighteen years old.

				ANTHONY
		Hello, Dad.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

squinting up at his son.

				MICHAEL
		Anthony.

He rises, and reaches up to his son, who is now taller than
he; he embraces him.

				MICHAEL
		You've grown so tall... so tall in
		the last year.  You're much taller
		than me.

				ANTHONY
		I was taller than you when I was
		fourteen.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I
		waited for you to have some lunch,
		but now it's all dried out.

				ANTHONY
		I'm not hungry.

				MICHAEL
		Well, that's alright... alright.
		Good.  You'll graduate in another
		year, isn't that right?  You know...
		I never finished college.  I was a
		good student, but I never finished.
		Of course, there was a war then.

Connie approaches them.

				CONNIE
		Don't let me interrupt anything,
		this will just take a second.  Here.
			(she takes out a
			small needle, and
			begins to prepare it)
		Your father has to have his insulin
		shot.  Why don't you go to your

		Anthony.

She begins to give Michael the shot.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.

Anthony goes on his way to the house with his things.
Connie gives Michael the shot.

				CONNIE
		Whenever I see that lake so cold, I

Alone in the garden.

OUR VIEW begins to MOVE CLOSER to him.  We begin to HEAR
MUSIC of the forties; happy music, swing music, as we move
CLOSER to Michael.

INT. OLD CORLEONE HOUSE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

SONNY CORLEONE, his arm wrapped around a smiling red-faced
Carlo Rizzi, pulls him into the Corleone dining room.

				SONNY
		Hey, who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi.
		Here... my brother Fredo, here's my
		Mom.  Mom, whatcha got cooking?
		And Carlo, this is my kid sister
		Connie.  Here, pull up a chair,
		Carol is sitting next to Connie.
		Oh, the droopy kid over there is
		Mike.  The college boy.

An older, lanky man enters the room, his arms laden with
presents.  This is TESSIO.

				TESSIO
		Buon Natale, everybody.  Buon
		Natale...
			(he smiles at Tom Hagen)
		Hi, Tom, how's every little thing?

				HAGEN
			(helping him with the presents)
		Wonderful, Sal.

Now the study door opens, and DON CORLEONE enters.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is dinner ready?

				MOM
		Two minutes.

The Don happily regards his family; his sons and daughters
and even some Grandchildren.  He raises a glass.

				DON CORLEONE
		A good life, a long life to all my
		children, and friends.  To my
		grandchildren, and those that will
		be.  To our family.

They all drink.

They refill glasses; then Tessio proposes a toast.

				TESSIO
		To our Godfather.

They all drink.

INT. THE DINING ROOM - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The family is happily at Christmas dinner.  Don Corleone
seated at the head of the table.

				SONNY
		What'd you think of those Japs, eh?
		The nerve of those Japs, coming
		right here in our own backyard
		dropping bombs!

				HAGEN
		Well, we could have expected it
		after the embargo.

				SONNY
		Hey!  Expect it or not, those Japs
		don't have a right to drop bombs in
		our backyard.  Whose side you on?

				MAMA
		Please, do we have to talk about
		the war at the table?  On Christmas,
		much less.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He has been listening to this discussion.

				MICHAEL
		Pop, I've decided I'm going to
		enlist.

A quiet hush descends over the table, as though everyone
knows the effect this will have on the old man.  Sonny tries
to make light of it.

				SONNY
		Kid, stay in college.  The girls
		are cuter, if you know what I mean.

				HAGEN
		Pop had to pull a lot of strings to
		get you your deferment.

				MICHAEL
		I never asked for it; I don't want
		it.

VIEW ON DON CORLEONE

Disturbed; but wise and prudent.

				DON CORLEONE
		My son wants to talk about this,
		and so we'll talk, but not at the
		dinner table.

He rises, and starts across the room toward his study.  Then
he looks back.

				DON CORLEONE
		Michael.

He disappears into his study.  Michael rises, glances around.
People are generally tense over the situation.  Michael
follows his father into the study.

INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD STUDY - NIGHT

The Don closes the door behind his son, and then moves
across the room.  He stops at the little bar there, and
pours himself a brandy.

				DON CORLEONE
		Would you like some?

				MICHAEL
		No, Dad.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now what is this talk about joining
		the army?  Eh?

				MICHAEL
		It's not talk; I'm doing it.

				DON CORLEONE
		You would risk your life for
		strangers?

				MICHAEL
		Not for strangers; for my country.

				DON CORLEONE
		Anyone not in your family, is a
		stranger.  Believe me, when trouble
		comes, your country won't take care
		of you.

				MICHAEL
		That's how it was in the old world,
		Pop, but this is not Sicily.

				DON CORLEONE
		I know.  I know, Michael.  It's
		Christmas, your brothers and sister
		are all here -- we are happy.
		Let's not spoil this.  Go your own
		way, but when you are ready, come
		to me the way a son should.  I have
		hopes for you...

                                         FIRST DRAFT. 3/22/79                       

                         


                         FADE IN:

                         BEFORE TITLES:
          The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a
          single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes
          faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow
          streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now,
          confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us
          and another, and as our surroundings become more
          visible, we discover that we are moving through a
          pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,.
          suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves
          on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.

          It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen
          Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at
          lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move
          toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past
          the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard
          dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main
          house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by
          a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named
          Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly.
          As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the
          car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom
          Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business
          suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house
          and looks off.

          HAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE
          Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,.
          Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten. The boy, dressed
          for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to-
          ward us.

          REVERSE ANGLE - ON TONY
           As he looks out at the lake we might sense that he
           is troubled and puzzled, although he is managing to
           keep his expression stoic. Hagen can be seen in the
          background, by the house 9 After a moment:

          Time to go.
          There is a beat and Tony composes himself, turns and
          moves up toward the house and Tom Hagen.

          EXT. FRONT OF TAEOE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - DAY

          The heavy, black sedan is loaded. Connie Corleane
          and a Housekeeper, in uniform, are bringing Mary,
          about five, out to the car. She too is dressed for
          travelling. As they put her into the car --

                         HAGEN
          No. Ere wanted me to tell you both
          how sorry he was.

          Connie would apparently prefer to avoid answering any
          questions.

          Hagen is the last one into the car. As it starts down
          the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie,
          Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave. The auto-
          matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens. The
          Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine
          passes through.
          TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE
          As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going
          back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up-
          ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in.
          Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one
          hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine,
          his expression unreadable-but somehow sad.

          We are close on a young man, Anthony Adams (Corleone),
          in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy
          at Annapolis. We are pulling back as the speaker --
          who is Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of State --
          continues, his accent faintly Scandinavian.

           CRUNDELLIUS' VOICE
          -- there are no limits to the goals
          to which we can each legitimately
          aspire. And now, as an unpopular war
          is ended in East Asia and we set our
          sights on new goals, I leave you with
          the words of another Sailor ---
          We continue to pull back to discover that we are at
          the Navy and Marine Corps stadium. It is a late Spring
          day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies. The
          Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered

          the white marble wall. It reads: "YE SHALL M TOW T=

          We pan off the motto to pick up Palnateer and Tony
          as they move through the great, columned rcom toward
          the desk at the end. The Guard at the desk, seeing
          Paimateer' s identification, signals h 1m and Tony up
          to the Badge Office which i.s up a flight of steps on
          the ricnt.

          We pick up Elizabeth Ann Dunne, about 30. She is a
          television personality, mainly an interviewer of
          celebrities, although sometime a Newsweman and talk-
          show performer. She is poised, attractive, warm,
          hirp. She is coming out of an office. She crosses
          through the newsroom with its teletypes and general
          sense of activity. A Cameraman comes up to her:

          We are on the Drill Instructor who brandishes a
          Marine Corps knife, six-inch blade, brass knuckles
          incorporated into the handle.

                         INSTRUCTOR
          This object is a United States
          Marine Corps killing knife. I..
          will now demonstrate that it is
          not worth doodley shit if you don't
          know how- to use it.

                         ANA ANGLE
          as the Instructor looks around the circle of Officer
          Trainees and from them chooses Tony.

                         INSTRUCTOR
          You.. You'd like to kill me,
          wouldn't you, Sir? Well, here's
          your chance.
          The Instructor tosses Tony the knife. Tony catches
          it. As they circle,. the Instructor taunts Tony.

                         INSTRUCTOR
          Come on. Come on. Make a move,
          Sir. Are you falling in love with
          me? Then do something hostile.
          Make a face. Stick out your tongue.
          Do something, Mister Adams.
          Tony swings the knife. The Instructor avoids him.

                         INSTRUCTOR
          My little bitty sister can make a
          better move than that, Six.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The Instructor offers a tempting target. Tony swings.
          The Instructor slaps his cap across Tony's face, grabs
          Tony's wrist and disarms him, throwing him to the
          ground.

          ANOTHER ANGLE - ON TONY
          The Instructor turns his back on Tony, deliherately .
          Tony gets to his feet and charges the .nst=,actorls back.

          43.

                         CONTINUED
          The Instructor has been waiting for this. Re flips
          Tony again.-
          Tony lies inert an the ground. The Instructor comes
          up, beads to inspect Tony. As he does so:

                         - INSTRUCTOR
          All right, Sir. You ---
          Re breaks off as. Tony has driven an upper cut into
          the Instructor's balls. The Instructor grabs his
          groin and goes down in a heap.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Tony rolls to his feet, grabs up the killing knife
          and presses it to the Instrutor's throat.

                         TONY
          All right you, son of a bitch, tell
          me about it..
          The Instructor is looking at Tony. Suddenly he grins;

                         INSTRUCTOR
          You're getting there, Mister Adams.

          ANOT3ER ANGLE
          Tony looks at the knife in his hand, then tosses it
          away and starts off. At this point a jeep comes
          bouncing over the hill and skids to a breadsiding
          stop.. We see that PaJ.ateer is at the wheel.

          a plume of dust, we ---?

          Palnateer is watching the Recreation Room television

                         CONTINUED:
          Danny, almost as wide as he is tali., his broad pug-
          natious face wreathed in a grin, camas cut of the
          prison gate, his hands held up in the "Victory" sign.
          He pushes his way through the Television Cameramen
          and Newsmen, not saying anything.
          We pan him over to a limousine which he gets into
          quickly. The limousine drives off.

                         NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
          Today in Leavenworth, Kansas, one--
          time International Brotherhood of
          Dockworkers' President, Danny DeVito
          i was. released. on pardon after serving
          six and. a half years of a fifteen
          year sentence an embezzlement and
          conspiracy charges. DeVito didn't
          state his future plans, but insiders
          expect him to challenge the incum-
          bent President, Pat Brady, in the up-
          coming election.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          As Tony comes into the room, Palmateer gives him a
          pen and a couple of pieces of paper.

                         I

          PAL.MATEER
          A couple of things for you to sign
          6 before you go operational. This is
          for your piece --

                         (SECOND PAPER)
          And this is your resignation. It's
          a technicality, but in case the shit
          ever really hits the fan, we'd have
          p to disclaim you.

                         (GRINS)
          It's called the principal of plaus-
          ible denial. We never invoke it
          until the cock crows thrice.
          As Tony is signing the papers, Palmateer has produced
          a service automatic from a canvas carryi+:g case. He
          puts it on the table before Tony ---

                         ANOTHER ARGLZ
          As a large car pulls up and stops in front of Tony,
          he opens the door and gets into the backseat. We
          now might be able to see that F'rankie is driving.
          With him in the front seat is Santino. In the back-
          seat is Umberto Croce.
          INT'. THE L SOUS tNE - DAY
          as Tony gets in and sits next to Croce. General

          As Croce sets the briefcase on his lap, Tony reaches
          into his pocket and gives him the key. Now Croce
          carefully unlocks the briefcase. As this is going on:

          by three urbane men, Morton, her Television Producer,
          Swartzwalder, a Jurist and McKissick, a young Senator.
          McKissick is lighting Elizabeth's cigarette as Tony

          Tony and Elizabeth are sitting up in bed. Tony is

                         TONY -
          Noise in the living- room.

                         (THEN)

          We have pulled back and panned slightly to include Tony
          who is sitting on the. floor, his back against the wall.

          Now, Tony turns to the Man and. starts down the hall
          with him. Tony has him by the back of the jacket, his
          Tun pressed against the back of the Second Man's head.

          As Tony enters with his prisoner, the First Man - the

          into Elizabeth's throat. He is looking the other way,
          but turns as: _

          Suddenly the Second Man's knees buckle as. Tony, in a
          lightning move, brings the gun barrel down across the
          Man's head.
          As the Second Man is on his hands and knees, Zi.?ce a

          We are pulling back. Also present in the large, attrac-

          What you've got to understand,
          Rocco, is that what happened to
          Al was business. What's done is
          done. The important thing is to
          avoid trouble if we can. This
          isn't the old days. The Five

          As DeVito drinks, the intercom is buzzing. Hagen
          flicks it.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          As the predominantly Latin American crowd cheers, we
          pick out Tony, in civilian clothes, amongst. the' cheer-
          ing people.

                         VIRAL
          The blood of our martyrs is still
          too fresh on our pavement. We will
          be friends and neighbors, but never
          again slaves to Imperialism.

                         1
          A young Latino, and we will recognize him as Ar=igo,
          has moved to Tony's side. As the cheers have erupted
          once more, Amigo, with'a brief nod of the head, indic-
          ates that Tony shouldfol:ow him.

          ANOT'_R ANGLE
          As Arrigo goes, Tony looks after him briefly, then over
          to the American Delegation including Lucas, the Assistant
          Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs; Cariock,
          the Speaker of the House and several prominent liberal
          Senators including McKissick of Utah and the elegant
          Harthaiemew of Pennsylvania.
          Also in the delegation, in uniform, is Stu Palmateer.
          The older man's eyes meet with Tony's for a brief
          moment. He has seen the exchange. He watches as
          Tony leaves, then looks over toward u_agudo, Vidal's

                         I
          Chief of Police. The harsh, heavy Policeman is laugh-
          1 ing at something Vidal has said, seemingly paying no
          attention to Tony's exit.

          INT. LOBBY ECT!L ME LA REVOLUTION - :TIGHT

          As Tony is crossing the lobby, Elizabeth Ann Dunne,
          followed by 'a small entourage, enters. Half a pace
          behind her is Kenny Morton, her producer and behind
          them are three men carrying portable TV equipment,
          cameras, tripods, batteries, so on. She is speaking
          to 8e.ny..

          Elizabeth crosses off toward the desk, Tony looks
          after her for a moment, puzzled, then crosses out.

          As Tony comes out of the hotel and crosses the garden
          grounds toward the street, we see that a fireworks
          display is still in progress.

          We pan off them to Arrigo passing. Tony follows. We
          move. in closer to Tony. A big, fat Mama comes out of

          now, a couple of blocks distant. We are on an old,
          but seaworthy fishing boat; the name on the stern is
          "Stelia.Maria". Amigo comes up the pier, pauses by
          the short gangway.

          the curb detonates -- disintigrates in a blinding dazzle
          of light. In the jolt of the shock wave, every window
          within half a mile radius shatters.
          A vast ball of flame and black, heavy smoke billows
          upwards from the corner where the doomsday vehicle and
          the first car were immolated.
          Now, the following Police cars, unable to stop and
          unable to avoid the flames which have spread like
          napalm all over the whole corner, skid into the flames
          and smoke, plowing into the wreckage.
          The buildings are in flames. A Policeman, his uniform
          and hair on fire, runs screaming out of the inferno.

               The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is 
               ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across 
               several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last 
               nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.

                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

               As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a 
               table near the back of the bar.

                                     ALL
                         Oh Jesus. Here we go.

               The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest 
               of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer. 
               Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a 
               softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22, 
               heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle 
               with.

               Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other 
               guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror 
               stories with eager disgust.

               All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a 
               rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are 
               its product.

                         fuckin' cat jumps in front of his 
                         car, and so he hits this cat--

                         --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!"
                         And he looks in his rearview and 
                         sees this cat -- I'm sorry--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And all the time he's apologizin' to 
                         the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, 
                         "I'm sorry." BANG!

                                     BILLY
                         Like it can understand.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And this Samoan guy comes runnin' 
                         out of his house and he's like "What 
                         the fuck are you doing to my cat?!" 
                         Mikey's like "I'm sorry" --BANG--" I 
                         hit your cat with my truck, and I'm 
                         just trying to put it out of it's 
                         misery" -- BANG! And the cat dies. 
                         So Mikey's like "Why don't you come 
                         look at the front of the truck."
                         'Cause the other guy's all fuckin 
                         flipped out about--

                                     WILL
                         Watching his cat get brained.

               Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, so he's like "Check the front 
                         of my truck, I can prove I hit it 
                         'cause there's probably some blood 
                         or something"--

                                     WILL
                         --or a tail--

                                     MORGAN
                         WILL!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And so they go around to the front 
                         of his truck... and there's another 
                         cat on the grille.

                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
                         No! Ugh!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Is that unbelievable? He brained an 
                         innocent cat!

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               The opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city 
               and the real people who live and work there, going about 
               their daily lives.

               We see a panoramic view of South Boston.

               Will sits in his apartment, walls completely bare. A bed, a 
               small night table and an empty basket adorn the room. A stack 
               of twenty or so LIBRARY BOOKS sit by his bed. He is flipping 
               through a book at about a page a second.

               Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house. His Cadillac 
               idles by the curb. Will comes out and they get in the car.

               We travel across crowded public housing and onto downtown.

               Finally, we gaze across the river and onto the great 
               cementdomed buildings that make up the M.I.T. campus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- DAY

               The classroom is packed with graduate students and TOM.

               PROFESSOR LAMBEAU (52) is at the lectern. The chalkboard 
               behind him is covered with theorems.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Please finish McKinley by next month.

               Many of you probably had this as undergraduates in real 
               analysis. It won't hurt to brush up. I am also putting an 
               advanced fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard--

               Everyone groans.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm hoping that one of you might 
                         prove it by the end of the semester. 
                         The first person to do so will not 
                         only be in my good graces, but go on 
                         to fame and fortune by having their 
                         accomplishment recorded and their 
                         name printed in the auspicious "M.I.T. 
                         Tech."

               Prof. Lambeau holds up a thin publication entitled "M.I.T.  
               Tech." Everyone laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Former winners include Nobel 
                         Laureates, world renowned astro-
                         physicists, Field's Medal winners 
                         and lowly M.I.T.  professors.

               More laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay. That is all.

               A smattering of applause. Students pack their bags.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNLAND  LATER

               The place is a monster indoor funpark. Will, Chuckie, Morgan, 
               and Billy are in adjoining batting cages. Will has disabled 
               the pitching machine in his and pitches to Chuckie. The boys 
               have been drinking. Will throws one to Chuckie, high and 
               tight.

               Several empty beer cans sit by the cage.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Will!

               Another pitch, inside.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're gonna get charged!

                                     WILL
                         You think I'm afraid of you, you big 
                         fuck? You're crowdin' the plate.

               Will guns another one, way inside.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Stop brushin' me back!

                                     WILL
                         Stop crowdin the plate!

               Chuckie laughs and steps back.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. 
                         We should go there sometime.

                                     WILL
                         What are we gonna do up there?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I don't know, we'll fuck up some 
                         smart kids.
                              (stepping back in)
                         You'd prob'ly fit right in.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you.

               Will fires a pitch at Chuckie's head. Chuckie dives to avoid 
               being hit. He gets up and whips his batting helmet at Will.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ROOFTOP -- EARLY AFTERNOON

               SEAN McGUIRE (52) sits, FORMALLY DRESSED, on the roof of his 
               apartment building in a beat-up lawn chair. Well-built and 
               fairly muscular, he stares blankly out over the city.

               On his lap rests an open invitation that reads "M.I.T. CLASS 
               OF '67 REUNION."

               While the morning is quiet and Sean sits serenely, there is 
               a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times. This 
               is a man who fought his way through life. On his lonely stare 
               we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS LAWN -- DAY

               A thirty year REUNION PARTY has taken over the lawn. A well 
               dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that 
               reads "WELCOME BACK CLASS OF '72." We find Professor Lambeau 
               standing with a drink in his hand, surveying the crowd. He 
               is interrupted by an approaching STUDENT.

                                     STUDENT
                         Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes.

                                     STUDENT
                         I'm in your applied theories class.
                         We're all down at the Math and Science 
                         building.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's Saturday.

                         I know. We just couldn't wait 'till 
                         Monday to find out.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Find out what?

                                     STUDENT
                         Who proved the theorem.

               EXT. TOM FOLEY PARK, S. BOSTON -- AFTERNOON

               In the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys, 
               drinking and smoking cigarettes. Will pops open a beer. The 
               boys have been here a while and it shows.

               Billy sees something that catches his interest.

                                     BILLY
                         Who's that? She's got a nice ass.

               Their P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a 
               beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA)

                                     MORGAN
                         Yah, that is a nice ass.

                         You could put a pool in that backyard.

                                     BILLY
                         Who's she talking to?

                                     MORGAN
                         That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

                                     WILL
                         Yah, Bobby Champa. He used to beat 
                         the shit outta' me in Kindergarten.

                                     BILLY
                         He's a pretty big kid.

                                     WILL
                         Yah, he's the same size now as he 
                         was in Kindergarten.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck this, let's get something to 
                         eat...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What Morgan, you're not gonna go 
                         talk to her?

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck her.

               The boys get up and walk down the bleachers.

                         I could go for a Whopper.

                              (nonchalant)
                         Let's hit "Kelly's."

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's 
                         Roast Beef" just cause you like the 
                         take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes 
                         out of our way.

                                     MORGAN
                         What else we gonna do we can't spare 
                         fifteen minutes?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell 
                         you why we're not going to "Kelly's." 
                         It's because the take-out bitch is a 
                         fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like 
                         her but she's dumb as a post and she 
                         has never got our order right, never 
                         once.

                                     MORGAN
                         She's not stupid.

                                     WILL
                         She's sharp as a marble.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         We're not goin'.
                              (beat)
                         I don't even like "Kelly's."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- LATER

               Lambeau, still in his reunion formal-wear, strides down the 
               hallway, carrying some papers. A group of students have 
               gathered by the chalkboard. They part like the red sea as he 
               approaches the board. Using the papers in hand, he checks 
               the proof.

               Satisfied, he turns to the class.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is correct? Who did this?

               Dead silence. Lambeau turns to an INDIAN STUDENT.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Nemesh?

               Nemesh shakes his head in awe.

                                     NEMESH
                         No way.

               Lambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, whoever You are, I'm sure you'll 
                         find this one challenging enough to 
                         merit coming forward with your 
                         identity.  That is, if you can do 
                         it.

               INT. CHUCKIE'S CAR, DRIVING IN SOUTH BOSTON -- CONTINUOUS

               The street is crowded as our boys drive down Broadway. They 
               move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down. Chuckie 
               sorts through a large "KELLY'S ROAST BEEF" BAG as he drives.

                                     MORGAN
                         Double Burger.

               Will holds the wheel for Chuckie as he looks through the 
               bag.

                                     MORGAN
                              (same tone)
                         Double Burger.

               Chuckie gets out fries for himself, hands Will his fries.

                                     MORGAN
                         I, I had a Kelly's Double Burger.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Would you shut the fuck up! I know 
                         what you ordered, I was there!

                                     MORGAN
                         So why don't you give me my sandwich?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do you mean "your sandwich?" I 
                         bought it.

                                     MORGAN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Yah, all right...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How much money you got?

                                     MORGAN
                         I told you, I just got change.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well give me your fuckin' change and 
                         we'll put your fuckin' sandwich on 
                         layaway.

                                     MORGAN
                         Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I think you should establish a good 
                         line of credit.

               Laughter, Chuckie goes back searching through the bag.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh motherfucker...

                                     WILL
                         She didn't do it again did she?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Jesus Christ. Not even close.

                                     MORGAN
                         Did she get my Double Burger?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!!
                         IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!

               Chuckie whips a FISH SANDWICH back to Morgan, then to Billy.

                                     WILL
                         Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone 
                         even order a Flyin' Fish?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, and we got four of 'em.

                                     BILLY
                         You gotta' be kiddin' me. Why do we 
                         even go to her?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Cause fuckin' Morgan's got a crush 
                         on her, we always go there and when 
                         we get to the window he never says a 
                         fuckin' word to her, he never even 
                         gets out of the car, and she never 
                         gets our order right cause she's the 
                         goddamn MISSING LINK!

                                     WILL
                         Well, she out did herself today...

                                     MORGAN
                         I don't got a crush on her.

               Push in on Will who sees something O.S.

               Will's P.O.V. reveals BOBBY CHAMPA and his friends walking 
               down the street. One of them casually lobs a bottle into a 
               wire garbage can. It SHATTERS and some of the glass hits a 
               FEMALE PASSERBY who, although unhurt, is upset.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do we got?

                                     WILL
                         I don't know yet.

               Will's P.O.V.: The woman says something to Bobby. He says 
               something back. By the look on her face, it was something 
               unpleasant.

                                     MORGAN
                         Come on, Will...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Shut up.

                                     MORGAN
                         No, why didn't you fight him at the 
                         park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' 
                         now, I'm eatin' my snack.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         So don't go.

               Will is out of the door, jogging toward Bobby Champa. Billy 
               gets out, following Will with a look of casual indifference.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, Let's go.

                                     MORGAN
                         I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.

               Leaving the car, Chuckie opens his door to follow.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (spins in his seat)
                         You're goin'. And if you're not out 
                         there in two fuckin' seconds, when 
                         I'm done with them you're next!

               And with that, Chuckie is out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK --CONTINUOUS

               Will comes jogging up towards BOBBY CHAMPA, calling out from 
               across the street,

                                     WILL
                              (smiling, good 
                              naturedly)
                         Hey, Bobby Champa! I went to 
                         Kindergarten with you right? Sister 
                         Margaret's class...

               Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure 
               of Will's intentions. Just when it looks as though Bobby 
               might remember him, Will DRILLS HIM with a sucker-punch which 
               begins the

               FIGHT SEQUENCE: 40 FRAMES OVER M. GAYE'S "LET'S GET IT ON."

               Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the 
               hapless Champa out cold.

               As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL. 
               Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground. The two 
               exchange messy punches on the sidewalk.

               Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying 
               to avoid being overrun.

               When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he 
               HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.

               Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a 
               shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he 
               was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.

               Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will 
               can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's 
               boys from the hood of a car.

               Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a 
               fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.

               The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown 
               wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone 
               throws a bottle.

               In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's 
               friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will, 
               standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING 
               him.

               ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT

               Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking 
               them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious 
               Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away.

               The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only 
               witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him.

               EXT. SIDEWALK (FULL SPEED) -- CONTINUOUS

               A crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, thanks for comin' out.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, you're all invited over to 
                         Morgan's house for a complementary 
                         fish sandwich.

               The Police slam Will into the hood of a car.

                                     WILL
                              (to Police)
                         Hey, I know it's not a French cruller, 
                         but it's free.

               The cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood, 
               another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car. 
               The look of rage returns to Will's eye.

                                     WILL
                         Get the fuck off me!

               Will resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE 
               KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a 
               fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though 
               he struggles -- takes a beating.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SEAN'S ROOF -- NIGHT

               Sean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is 
               now loose and an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS is at his side. 
               He stares out over the City. A MATRONLY LANDLADY comes out 
               of a doorway on the roof.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Sean?

               Sean doesn't answer.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Sean? You okay?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

               A beat.

                                     LANDLADY
                         It's getting cold.

               After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs. Sean 
               doesn't move.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               EXT. CHARLES RIVER, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

               The morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE -- NEXT MORNING

               Will emerges from the courthouse. Chuckie is waiting for him 
               in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee. 
               He hands one of them to Will. This feels routine.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         When's the arraignment?

                                     WILL
                         Next week.

               Chuckie pulls away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

               Students walk to class, carrying bags. More than any other, 
               students seem to be heading into one PARTICULAR CLASSROOM.

               INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- MORNING

               The classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it. Tom 
               takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited 
               environment with mock pomposity and good humor.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is it my imagination, or has my class 
                         grown considerably?

               Laughter.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I look around and see young people 
                         who are my students, young people 
                         who are not my students as well as 
                         some of my colleagues. And by no 
                         stretch of my imagination do I think 
                         you've all come to hear me lecture.

               More laughter.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         But rather to ascertain the identity 
                         of who our esteemed "The Tech" has 
                         come to call "The Mystery Math 
                         Magician."

               He holds up the M.I.T. Tech featuring a silhouetted figure, 
               emblazoned with a large, white question mark. The headline 
               reads "Mystery Math Magician strikes again."

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Whoever you are, you've solved four 
                         of the most difficult theorems I've 
                         ever given a class. So without further 
                         ado, come forward silent rogue, and 
                         receive thy prize.

               The class waits in breathless anticipation. A STUDENT shifts 
               his weight in his chair, making a noise.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my 
                         spectators, but it appears there 
                         will be no unmasking here today. I'm 
                         going to have to ask those of you 
                         not enrolled in the class to make 
                         your escape now or, for the next 
                         three hours be subjected to the 
                         mundities of eigenvectors.

               People start to gather their things and go. Lambeau picks up 
               a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         However, my colleagues and I have 
                         conferred. There is a problem on the 
                         board, right now, that took us two 
                         years to prove. So let this be said; 
                         the gauntlet has been thrown down. 
                         But the faculty have answered the 
                         challenge and answered with vigor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Lambeau comes out of his office with Tom and locks the door. 
               As he turns to walk down the hallway, he stops. A faint 
               TICKING SOUND can be heard. He turns and walks down the hall.

               Lambeau and Tom come around a corner. His P.O.V. reveals a 
               figure in silhouette blazing through the proof on the 
               chalkboard. There is a mop and a bucket beside him. As Lambeau 
               draws closer, reveal that the figure is Will, in his janitor's 
               uniform. There is a look of intense concentration in his 
               eyes.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me!

               Will looks up, immediately starts to shuffle off.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, I'm sorry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What're you doing?

                                     WILL
                              (walking away)
                         I'm sorry.

               Lambeau follows Will down the hall.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's your name?
                              (beat)
                         Don't you walk away from me. This is 
                         people's work, you can't graffiti 
                         here.

                                     WILL
                         Hey fuck you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (flustered)
                         Well... I'll be speaking to your 
                         supervisor.

               Will walks out. Lambeau goes to "fix" the proof, scanning 
               the blackboard for whatever damage Will caused. He stops, 
               scans the board again. Amazement registers on his face.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         My God.

               Down the hall, we hear the DOOR CLOSE. He turns to look for 
               Will, who is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW AND ARROW PUB, CAMBRIDGE -- THAT NIGHT

               A crowded Harvard Bar. Will and our gang walk by a line of 
               several Harvard students, waiting to be carded.

                                     MORGAN
                         What happened?
                              (beat)
                         You got fired, huh?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.

                                     MORGAN
                              (starts laughing)
                         How fuckin' retarded do you have to 
                         be to get shit-canned from that job? 
                         How hard is it to push a fuckin' 
                         broom?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You got fired from pushing a broom, 
                         you little bitch.

                                     MORGAN
                         Yah, that was different. Management 
                         was restructurin'--

                                     BILLY
                         Yah, restructurin' the amount of 
                         retards they had workin' for them.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck you, you fat fuck.

                                     BILLY
                         Least I work for a livin'.
                              (to Will)
                         Why'd you get fired?

                                     WILL
                         Management was restructurin'.

               Laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         My uncle can probably get you on my 
                         demo team.

                                     MORGAN
                         What the fuck? I just asked you for 
                         a job yesterday!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I told you "no" yesterday!

               After two students flash their ID's to the doorman (CASEY) 
               our boys file past him.

                                     ALL
                              (one after another)
                         What's up Case.

               With an imperceptible nod, Casey waves our boys through. A 
               fifth kid, a HARVARD STUDENT, tries to follow. He is stopped 
               by Casey's massive, outstretched arm:

                                     CASEY
                         ID?

               INT. BOW AND ARROW -- CONTINUOUS

               Chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher, 
               all but Morgan cough up some crumpled dollars.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So, this is a Harvard bar, huh? I 
                         thought there'd be equations and 
                         shit on the wall.

               INT. BACK SECTION, BOW AND ARROW -- MOMENTS LATER

               Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have 
               made themselves comfortable. He [Chuckie] spots two ATTRACTIVE 
               YOUNG HARVARD WOMEN sitting together at the end of the bar.

               Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair. 
               He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston 
               accent.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, how's it goin'?

                                     LYDIA
                         Fine.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So, you ladies ah, go to school here?

                                     LYDIA
                         Yes.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, cause I think I had a class 
                         with you.

               At this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan 
               Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate 
               themselves within listening distance. A rather large student 
               in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie. 
               He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering 
               over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's 
               attention.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What class?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Ah, history I think.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yah, it's not a bad school...

               At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in.

                                     CLARK
                         What class did you say that was?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         History.

                                     CLARK
                         How'd you like that course?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Good, it was all right.

                                     CLARK
                         History? Just "history?" It must 
                         have been a survey course then.

               Chuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy 
               exchange a look and move subtly closer.

                                     CLARK
                         Pretty broad. "History of the World?"

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, come on pal we're in classes 
                         all day. That's one thing about 
                         Harvard never seizes to amaze me, 
                         everybody's talkin' about school all 
                         the time.

                                     CLARK
                         Hey, I'm the last guy to want to 
                         talk about school at the bar. But as 
                         long as you're here I want to "seize" 
                         the opportunity to ask you a question.

               Billy shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan 
               see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again..."

                                     CLARK
                         Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your 
                         history class.

               Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not.

               When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and 
               rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         To tell you the truth, I wasn't there 
                         much. The class was rather elementary.

                                     CLARK
                         Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that 
                         it was. I remember the class, it was 
                         just between recess and lunch.

               Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All right, are we gonna have a 
                         problem?

                                     CLARK
                         There's no problem. I was just hoping 
                         you could give me some insight into 
                         the evolution of the market economy 
                         in the early colonies. My contention 
                         is that prior to the Revolutionary 
                         War the economic modalities especially 
                         of the southern colonies could most 
                         aptly be characterized as agrarian 
                         precapitalist and...

               Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and 
               is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.

                                     WILL
                         Of course that's your contention. 
                         You're a first year grad student. 
                         You just finished some Marxian 
                         historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, 
                         and so naturally that's what you 
                         believe until next month when you 
                         get to James Lemon and get convinced 
                         that Virginia and Pennsylvania were 
                         strongly entrepreneurial and 
                         capitalist back in 1740. That'll 
                         last until sometime in your second 
                         year, then you'll be in here 
                         regurgitating Gordon Wood about the 
                         Pre-revolutionary utopia and the 
                         capital-forming effects of military 
                         mobilization.

                                     CLARK
                              (taken aback)
                         Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, 
                         because Wood drastically 
                         underestimates the impact of--

                                     WILL
                         "Wood drastically underestimates the 
                         impact of social distinctions 
                         predicated upon wealth, especially 
                         inherited wealth..." You got that 
                         from "Work in Essex County," Page 
                         421, right? Do you have any thoughts 
                         of your own on the subject or were 
                         you just gonna plagiarize the whole 
                         book for me?

               Clark is stunned.

                                     WILL
                         Look, don't try to pass yourself off 
                         as some kind of an intellect at the 
                         expense of my friend just to impress 
                         these girls.

               Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit.

                                     WILL
                         The sad thing is, in about 50 years 
                         you might start doin' some thinkin' 
                         on your own and by then you'll realize 
                         there are only two certainties in 
                         life.

                                     CLARK
                         Yeah? What're those?

                                     WILL
                         One, don't do that.  Two -- you 
                         dropped a hundred and fifty grand on 
                         an education you coulda' picked up 
                         for a dollar fifty in late charges 
                         at the Public Library.

               Will catches Skylar's eye.

                                     CLARK
                         But I will have a degree, and you'll 
                         be serving my kids fries at a drive 
                         through on our way to a skiing trip.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         Maybe. But at least I won't be a 
                         prick.
                              (beat)
                         And if you got a problem with that, 
                         I guess we can step outside and deal 
                         with it that way.

               While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] 
               decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.

                                     WILL
                         If you change your mind, I'll be 
                         over by the bar.

               He turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a 
               look.

               Morgan turns to a nearby girl.

                                     MORGAN
                         My boy's wicked smart.

               INT. BOW AND ARROW, AT THE BAR -- LATER

               Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement 
               as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the 
               players shoot miniature balls at a small basket. In the B.G.  
               occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting "Larry!" When he scores.

               Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You suck.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I've been sitting over there for 
                         forty-five minutes waiting for you 
                         to come talk to me. But I'm just 
                         tired now and I have to go home and 
                         I wasn't going to keep sitting there 
                         waiting for you.

                                     WILL
                         I'm Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Skylar. And by the way. That guy 
                         over there is a real dick and I just 
                         wanted you to know he didn't come 
                         with us.

                                     WILL
                         I kind of got that impression.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get 
                         up early and waste some more money 
                         on my overpriced education.

                                     WILL
                         I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Here's my number.

               Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to 
               Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Maybe we could go out for coffee 
                         sometime?

                                     WILL
                         Great, or maybe we could go somewhere 
                         and just eat a bunch of caramels.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         When you think about it, it's just 
                         as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughs)
                         Okay, sounds good.

               She turns.

                                     WILL
                         Five minutes.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         I was trying to be smooth.
                              (indicates clock)
                         But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna 
                         come over there and talk to you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See, it's my life story. Five more 
                         minutes and I would have got to hear 
                         your best pick-up line.

                                     WILL
                         The caramel thing is my pick-up line.

               A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Glad I came over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW AND ARROW -- LATER

               Our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about 
               their bar-ball exploits. Across the street is another bar 
               with a glass front. Morgan spots Clark sitting by the window 
               with some friends.

                                     MORGAN
                         There goes that fuckin' Barney right 
                         now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." 
                         We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

                                     WILL
                         Hold up.

               Will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window 
               and stands across from Clark, separated only by the glass. 
               He POUNDS THE GLASS to get Clark's attention.

                                     WILL
                         Hey!

               Clark turns toward Will.

                                     WILL
                         DO YOU LIKE APPLES?

               Clark doesn't get it.

                                     WILL
                         DO YOU LIKE APPLES?!

                                     CLARK
                         Yeah?

               Will SLAMS SKYLAR'S PHONE NUMBER against the glass.

                                     WILL
                         WELL I GOT HER NUMBER! HOW DO YA 
                         LIKE THEM APPLES?!!

               Will's boys erupt into laughter. Angle on Clark, deflated.

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               The boys make their way home, piled into Chuckie's car, 
               laughing together.

               EXT. CHARLES STREET BRIDGE -- DAWN

               Shot of car crossing over the Charles St. Bridge, overtaking 
               a red-line train.

               EXT. CHARLESTON BACKROAD -- DAWN

               Traveling through narrow back roads in Charlestown, passing 
               the Bunker Hill monument.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. M.I.T. BUILDING AND GROUNDS GARAGE -- DAY

               Lambeau walks into a small garage facility. The area stores 
               lawn machinery and various tools. An older man, TERRY (58) 
               sits behind the desk reading the BOSTON HERALD sports page. 
               Lambeau has obviously never been here before. He takes in 
               the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable. Gets dirty.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me. Is this the buildings and 
                         grounds office?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, can I help you?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm trying to find the name of a 
                         student who works here.

                                     TERRY
                         No students work for me.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Could you just check, because the 
                         young man who works in my building--

                                     TERRY
                         Which one's your building?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Building two.

               Terry checks a list behind his [own] desk. Looks up.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, if something was stolen, I 
                         should know about it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, no. Nothing like that. I just 
                         need his name.

                                     TERRY
                         I can't give you his name unless you 
                         have a complaint.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Please, I'm a professor here and 
                         it's very important.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, he didn't show up for work 
                         today...

               Terry takes a beat. Holding all the cards.

                                     TERRY
                         Look, he got his job through his 
                         P.O. so you can call him.

               Terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk. Takes out a 
               card and hands it to Lambeau. Lambeau looks blankly at the 
               card which reads: "PAROLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM."

               INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

               Will stands before JUDGE MALONE (40) being arraigned. It is 
               fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will 
               and the PROSECUTOR. Lambeau walks in from the back.

                                     WILL
                         There is a lengthy legal precedent, 
                         Your Honor, going back to 1789, 
                         whereby a defendant may claim self-
                         defense against an agent of the 
                         government where the act is shown to 
                         be a defense against tyranny, a 
                         defense of liberty--

               The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who 
                         signed the complaint isn't in my 
                         courtroom. Why is that?

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         He's in the hospital with a broken 
                         knee, Your Honor. But I have 
                         depositions from the other officers.

                                     WILL
                         Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in 
                         his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit 
                         back in 1887, that "Every American 
                         citizen is by birth, a sworn officer 
                         of the state.  Every man is a 
                         policeman." As for the other officers, 
                         even William Congrave said; "he that 
                         first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft 
                         he that has stolen the treasure."

               Will cranks it up.

                                     WILL
                              (to Prosecutor)
                         I am afforded the right to speak in 
                         my own defense by our constitution, 
                         Sir.  The same document which 
                         guarantees my right to liberty. 
                         "Liberty," in case you've forgotten, 
                         is "the soul's right to breathe, and 
                         when it cannot take a long breath 
                         laws are girded too tight.  Without 
                         liberty, man is a syncope."
                              (beat, to Judge)
                         Ibid. Your Honor.

               The Judge interrupts.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Son,
                              (a beat)
                         My turn.

               The Judge opens Will's CASE HISTORY.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                              (reading)
                         June, '93, assault, Sept. '93 
                         assault... Grand theft auto February 
                         '94.

               A beat, the Judge takes particular notice.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Where, apparently, you defended 
                         yourself and had the case thrown out 
                         by citing "free property rights of 
                         horse and carriage" from 1798...

               Lambeau has to smile, impressed. The Judge shakes his head.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         March, '94 public drunkenness, public 
                         nudity, assault. 10/94 mayhem. 
                         November '94, assault. Jan. '95 
                         impersonating a police officer, 
                         mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned--

               The Judge takes a beat. Gives Will a look.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         You're in my courtroom, now and I am 
                         aware of your priors.
                              (beat)
                         I'm also aware that you're an orphan. 
                         You've been through several foster 
                         homes. The state removed you from 
                         three because of serious physical 
                         abuse.

               The Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Another Judge might care. You hit a 
                         cop, you go in.
                              (beat)
                         Motion to dismiss denied.

               The Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Keep workin' on your arguments, son. 
                         A word of advice for trial; speak 
                         English.

               As Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches 
               Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me, your Honor.
                              (offers hand)
                         Gerald Lambeau.

               An awkward beat. Lambeau waits for some sign of recognition.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm a professor at M.I.T.

               The Judge offers only a blank look.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Oh. Pleased to meet you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Do you have a minute?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A GUARD walks Will down a hallway toward a group of phones.

                         One.

               The Guard gives Will a hard look for a beat. Then leaves.

                                     WILL
                         How many?

               Will picks up the phone, dials.

                                     WILL

                                     WILL
                         It's Will, the really funny good 
                         looking guy you met at the bar?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting 
                         anyone who fits that description.

                                     WILL
                         Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, 
                         obnoxious, toothless loser who got 
                         drunk and wouldn't leave you alone 
                         all night.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd 
                         call.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this 
                         week we could go to a cafe and have 
                         some caramels.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Sounds good, where are you now?

               Professor Lambeau sits, waiting. Will is brought in, shackled, 
               by the guard.

                         Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck do you want?

                         I've spoken with the judge and he's 
                         agreed to release you under my 
                         supervision.

                                     WILL
                              (suspicious)
                         Really?

                         Yes. Under two conditions.

                                     WILL
                         What're those?

                         That you meet with me twice a week
                              (a beat)
                         and you meet with a therapist.

                                     WILL
                         If I agree to this, I walk right 
                         now?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right.

                                     WILL
                         I'll do the work. I'm not going to 
                         meet with a therapist.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, 
                         Will.
                              (beat)
                         I've already spoken to one therapist, 
                         his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a 
                         friend of mine. He's also published 
                         four books and is widely considered 
                         to be one of the brightest men in

                         I'm sure it'll be better than spending 
                         the next six months in jail.

               INT. FUNLAND -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie walk up to an enclosed trampoline. Billy 
               and Morgan prefer to use it for their own version of 
               "Wrestlemania."

               As Will and Chuckie approach, Billy is on top of a bloodied 
               Morgan and has him in the "Cobra Clutch."  Will and Chuckie 
               watch for a beat. Billy tightens his grip.

                                     BILLY
                         Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!

                         Oh, Morgan!

               Chuckie turns to Will, conspiratorially as they wait for the 
               fight to finish.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What'd you get? You get leniency?

                         You're fuckin' good.

               Will smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Just submit, Morgan. He's got you in 
                         the Cobra Clutch.

                                     MORGAN

               INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading. A closer 
               look reveals he is reading a self-help PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. Will 
               is flipping through the book at about a page per second. He 
               shakes his head and smiles. Upon finishing the book, he throws 
               it in a nearby WASTEBASKET. Push in on the back of the book 
               where a SMILING PSYCHOLOGIST is pictured.

               INT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

               Will sits in a well decorated Psychologist's Office. Across 
               from Will sits the same PSYCHOLOGIST, HENRY LIPKIN (40), 
               from the book. They are in mid-session.

                                     WILL
                         That's why I love stock-car racin'. 
                         That Dale Ernhart's real good.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Now you know Will, and I know, what 
                         you need to be doing. You have a 
                         gift.

                                     WILL
                         I could work the pit maybe, but I 
                         could never drive like Dale Ernhart--

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         You have a quality -- something you 
                         were born with, that you have no 
                         control over -- and you are, in a 
                         sense, hiding that by becoming a 
                         janitor. And I'm not saying that's 
                         wrong. I'm friends with the janitor 
                         that works in my building.  He's 
                         been to my house for dinner. As a 
                         matter of fact I did some free 
                         consultation for "Mike" -- that's 
                         not his real name. That's in my book.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had 
                         the same problems as "Chad" the 
                         stockbroker.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Yes. The pressures you feel, and 
                         again, I am neither labeling nor 
                         judging them, are keeping you from 
                         fulfilling your potential -- you're 
                         in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- 
                         the Shenanigan's, Will.

                                     WILL
                         You're right. I know.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Will, your not getting off that easy.

                                     WILL
                         No, but, I mean you know... I do 
                         other things. That no one knows about.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Like what, Will?

                                     WILL
                         I go places, I interact.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         What places?

                                     WILL
                         Certain, clubs.
                              (beat)
                         Like, Paradise. It's not bad.

               Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look.

                                     WILL
                         It's just that feeling when you can 
                         take your shirt off and really dance.
                              (beat)
                         When the music owns you. Do you 
                         understand?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         I might understand that.

                                     WILL
                         Do you find it hard to hide the fact 
                         that you're gay?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, I read your book. I talked to 
                         you. It's just something I know to 
                         be true.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         That's very presumptuous.

                                     WILL
                         Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready 
                         to give me a jump.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                              (a little laugh)
                         Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, 
                         but I'm married and I have two 
                         children.

                                     WILL
                         I'm sure you do. You probably got a 
                         real nice house, nice car -- your 
                         book's a best seller.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         You're getting defensive, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Look, man. I don't care if you're 
                         putting from the rough. There are 
                         solid arguments that some of the 
                         greatest people in history were gay; 
                         Alexander the Great, Caesar, 
                         Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, 
                         Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny 
                         Terrio, not many straight men can 
                         dance like that.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Who is "Danny Terrio?"

                                     WILL
                         If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your 
                         shot. Take some pride in it. You go 
                         to church? So fuckin' what, God loves 
                         you.  I mean, Christ. A guy as well 
                         known as you? By the time you put 
                         your disguise on and skulk out of 
                         the house Sunday nights you probably 
                         look like "Inspector Clouseau."

               The Psychologist calmly packs his things.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Well, I can see this is pointless...

                                     WILL
                         You're getting defensive... Henry. 
                         And hey, chief -- tell the wife, at 
                         least.  Christ, set her free.

               The shrink gets up and walks out.

                                     WILL
                         Fuckin' hypocrite...

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               The Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of 
               Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Henry?

               The Psychologist keeps walking.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         No. You know what, Gerry? This is 
                         why I don't do pro-bono anymore. 
                         It's not worth it to me.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What happened?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         I don't have the time. I'm going on 
                         national television this week.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Wait a minute, Henry...

               He [Henry] is out the door. Lambeau looks to Tom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will is in Lambeau's office. Lambeau is at the board, working 
               on a diagram as Tom takes notes. Will seems disinterested.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This rectangle is subdivided into 
                         rectangles. One edge of an inner 
                         rectangle is an integer. Can you 
                         prove that one edge of the larger 
                         rectangle is an integer?

                                     WILL
                         Of course.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay. How?

                                     WILL
                         It's an integer proof.

               Lambeau smiles.

                                     WILL
                         What? Hey, look buddy my time's almost 
                         up. You want me to sit here for an 
                         hour and write it out?

               Lambeau says nothing. Will gets up and goes to the board.

                                     WILL
                         Look, I'll give you the key steps to 
                         it but I'm not gonna do the whole 
                         thing.

               Lambeau keeps smiling.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That would be a monumental waste of 
                         time, wouldn't it, Will?

                                     WILL
                         I think so.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I happen to know so.

               Lambeau rises and goes to the board.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're thinking too hard. What if I 
                         did this?

               He draws a vertical line through the diagram.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now, what if I do this?

               He draws a horizontal line through the diagram. He hands 
               Will the chalk.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you ever played checkers?

               Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at. In a flash he starts 
               drawing lines through the diagram, energized.

                                     WILL
                         You color-code it. Half-red, half-
                         black.  If that's an integer--

               Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will].

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's that?

                                     WILL
                         Half-red, half-black--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --that?--

                                     WILL
                         --Half-red, half-black--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --That edge!

                                     WILL
                         An integer.

               The two stop. They are silent for a moment. Like two 
               gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (checks his watch)
                         It would appear we got that proof in 
                         under the wire after all. It's not 
                         how hard you look at things, young 
                         man, it's the way you look at them. 
                         If you take aim before you fire, you 
                         will find the most difficult problems 
                         become, quite literally, child's 
                         play.

               Will gets his coat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, you've managed to offend four 
                         of my colleagues so much that they 
                         refused to come back. You're meeting 
                         with the leading hypnotist in the 
                         country next week and Tom and I plan 
                         to sit in on the sessions, so I expect 
                         you to behave appropriately.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits in a chair across from Lambeau and the HYPNOTIST.

               Lambeau's assistant, TOM (33) takes notes. The Hypnotist 
               makes small talk with Lambeau, who checks his watch.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Shall we start the, uh...

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You 
                         guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Yes, Will. We'll get to that. But 
                         first, why don't you go to sleep for 
                         me.

               He SNAPS HIS FINGERS and instantly Will's head goes BACK and 
               his EYES CLOSE. The Hypnotist gives Lambeau a look.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Would you mind standing on one leg?

               Will gets up and stands on one leg. Lambeau is impressed.

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- LATER

               Will is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state. The 
               mood is more serious now.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now 
                         how old are you?

                                     WILL
                         Seven.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         And what do you see?

                                     WILL
                         Somethin's in my room.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         What is it?

                                     WILL
                         It's like a small figure, hoverin' 
                         over me. Gettin' closer.

               Will flinches.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         You're in a safe place, Will.

                                     WILL
                         It's touching me.

               Lambeau makes a sound. The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau] 
               with his [Hypnotist's] finger. Tom returns to his note-taking.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Where is it touching you?

                                     WILL
                         Down there.
                              (indicating genitals)
                         And I'm nervous.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         You don't have to be nervous, Will.

               Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks. This is working.

                                     WILL
                         'Cause I'm not ready.
                              (calming)
                         But the figure tells me everything's 
                         gonna be all right. 'Cause the 
                         figure's a Libra too. And we start 
                         dancin' and it's beautiful--

               Will breaks into song at full volume.

                                     WILL
                         "SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!"

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (getting up)
                         Oh Jesus.

               The Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door. 
               Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets."

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Wait a minute, Barry.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         I have better ways to spend my time.

               He is gone. Will stops singing, laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, for God's sake, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this 
                         one on me. He left, I wanted to talk 
                         to him for another twenty minutes. I 
                         was havin' fun.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I told you to cooperate with these 
                         people.

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece 
                         of work.

               Will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of 
               Lambeau.

                                     WILL
                              (spooky voice)
                         Look into my eyes. I don't need 
                         therapy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Get out, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Okay... don't forget to get another 
                         therapist for next week.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's enough.

               Will is out the door. Lambeau turns to Tom.

                                     TOM
                         I called Mel Weintraub this morning, 
                         to check for availability.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's the point?

                                     TOM
                         What do you want to do?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         There is somebody...

                                     TOM
                         Who is he?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He was my roommate in college.

               INT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- DAY

               This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class. 
               Emblazoned on the door is "room 101." While the lecture hall 
               could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here 
               today.

               Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired 
               of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the 
               tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student 
               body.

                                     SEAN
                         Establishing trust is the most 
                         important component in making 
                         breakthroughs with a patient. Why?

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         Maureen?

               MAUREEN'S only response is an empty stare.

                                     SEAN
                         Keep up the good work, Maureen. 
                         Vinnie?

               VINNIE looks up.

                                     VINNIE
                         Because trust is an important thing.

                                     SEAN
                         Don't bullshit me, Vinnie. Didn't 
                         your brother give you the notes? 
                         Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you 
                         then they won't feel safe enough to 
                         be honest with you -- then there's 
                         no point to them being in therapy. 
                         It's like saying -- "Fine, come here 
                         and don't tell me a thing but go 
                         home feeling like you're doing 
                         something about your problems -- and 
                         give me my fifty bucks before you 
                         leave will ya'!"

               He looks around the room for approval. No one is listening.

                                     SEAN
                         If you don't help them trust you -- 
                         then there's no way you'll ever get 
                         them to sleep with you. And that 
                         should be the goal of any good 
                         therapist. Insecure women, you know... 
                         nail 'em when they're vulnerable, 
                         that's always been my motto.

               The students look up, somewhat stunned.

                                     SEAN
                         See, I got Vinnie's attention.

               Laughter. Sean starts to resume his lecture, when he notices 
               LAMBEAU standing in the back of the room. There is an awkward 
               moment.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean.

                                     SEAN
                              (to class)
                         Well, it seems we're in the presence 
                         of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau 
                         is a Field's Medal winner. 
                         Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.

               The students stare blankly.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello.

                                     SEAN
                         The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize 
                         for math.
                              (beat)
                         But it's only given out every four 
                         years.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         Okay, that's all for today. Try and 
                         get through Fernald by Monday.

               The class starts to pack up and file out. Lambeau approaches 
               Sean who steps down from the lectern.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Good to see you.

                                     SEAN
                         Good to see you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is there someplace we can talk?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar on their first date. They watch a street 
               MAGICIAN doing tricks with a rabbit. The guy's tricks are 
               pretty good, but his on-stage persona could use some work. 
               He is incessantly repeating the phrase "this is the rabbit, 
               the rabbit really does the tricks." Will gives Skylar a look 
               and they move on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOY STORE -- LATER

               Will and Skylar walk into the small shop.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't know, it was just kind of 
                         the boring suburban thing. Private 
                         school, Harvard, and now Med. School.
                              (Beat)
                         I actually figured out that at the 
                         end of it, my brain will be worth a 
                         quarter of a million dollars. I 
                         shouldn't have told you that...

                                     WILL
                         I bet your parents were happy to 
                         pay.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I was happy to pay. I inherited the 
                         money.

                                     WILL
                         Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Stanford. I'm leaving in June after 
                         I graduate.

                                     WILL
                         So you just want to use me and go?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, I'm gonna experiment on you 
                         for my anatomy class, then go.

                                     WILL
                         In that case, fine.
                              (beat)
                         Want to see my magic trick?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Sure.

               Will, pulls out a bulging HANDFUL OF CARAMELS.

                                     WILL
                         Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels 
                         disappear.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay...

               Will goes into all manner of hocus-pocus theatrics. Then 
               shakes his hand wildly. The trick doesn't pan out and the 
               caramels go flying all over the store. Skylar laughs.

                                     WILL
                         It works better when I have my rabbit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

               Lambeau and Sean share a table at this exclusive restaurant.

               Sean seems slightly out of place in his wrinkled sport coat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I didn't see you at the reunion.

                         I've been busy.

                         Since Nancy died.

               INT. HARVARD SQ. DINER: "THE TASTY" -- NIGHT

               A FRY COOK hands Will and Skylar a pair of CHEESEBURGERS.

                         Have you ever seen Annie Hall?

                         No.

                         Well, there's this part of the movie 
                         that's about how there's always this 
                         tension on a first date where both 
                         people are thinking about what's 
                         going to happen with the whole 'good 
                         night kiss' thing.

               Will smiles.

                                     WILL
                         I really don't 'date' that much.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughs)
                         You know what I mean. I know you've 
                         at least thought about it.

                                     WILL
                         No I haven't...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes you have. You were thinking you 
                         were gonna get a good night kiss.

                                     WILL
                              (mock protest)
                         No I wasn't...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes you were.

                                     WILL
                         I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good 
                         night laid" but... I'll take a kiss.

               She laughs.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh, you will?

                                     WILL
                         No... I was hoping to get a kiss.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Then why don't we just get it out of 
                         the way.

               He looks at her.

                                     WILL
                         Now?

               Both of them have cheeseburger in their mouths.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah.

               They kiss, mouths full of burger. It's nice. A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         That had to be the worst good night 
                         kiss...

               Will laughs.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, look lady, I'm just here for 
                         the free food.

               She smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Free?

                                     WILL
                         Hey, I spent all my money on those 
                         caramels.

               She laughs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- SAME

               Lambeau and Sean, having finished their meal. Lambeau has 
               been pitching Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full 
                         schedule.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This kid's special, Sean. I've never 
                         seen anything like him.

                                     SEAN
                         Not much free time, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you ever heard of a man named 
                         Ramanujan?

               Sean nods his head.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He was alive over a hundred years 
                         ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not 
                         feathers...

               Sean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny 
                         hut in India. No formal education, 
                         no access to other works. But he 
                         came across an old math book and 
                         from this basic text he was able to 
                         extrapolate theories that had baffled 
                         mathematicians for years.

                                     SEAN
                         And he mailed it to Hardy--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right, Sean. He mailed it to 
                         a professor at Cambridge who 
                         immediately recognized the brilliance 
                         in his work and brought Ramanujan to 
                         England.

                                     SEAN
                         Where he contracted pneumonia and 
                         died at a young age--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         They worked together for the remainder 
                         of their lives, producing some of 
                         the most exciting math theory ever 
                         done.  Ramanujan's genius was 
                         unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like 
                         that. But he's very defensive and I 
                         need someone who can get through to 
                         him.

                                     SEAN
                         Why me?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I need someone with your kind of 
                         background.

                                     SEAN
                         My kind of background?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're from the same neighborhood. 
                         South Boston.

                                     SEAN
                         He's from Southie? How many people 
                         did you try before you came to me?

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (looks squarely at 
                              Sean)
                         Five.

               Sean gives a slight, knowing smile.

                                     SEAN
                         Who? Barry, Henry, Rick...

               Lambeau nods.

                                     SEAN
                         Not Rick? You didn't send him to 
                         Rick?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Just meet with the boy once a week.

                                     SEAN
                         Can we do it at my office?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That would be fine.

               The waiter comes with the CHECK. Each man reaches for it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, please.

                                     SEAN
                         I got it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's on the college.

               Sean relents.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- MORNING

               Establishing shot of the red-brick campus. Planes land at 
               nearby Logan airport. Will walks up the steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean's office is comfortable. Books are stacked against the 
               wall. There is a PAINTING on the wall behind Sean. Sean is 
               seated behind a desk. Lambeau sits in a chair in the back of 
               the room, next to Tom. A long beat passes, they wait.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Any vulnerability he senses, he'll 
                         exploit.

                                     SEAN
                         I'll be okay.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's a poker game with this young 
                         man.  Don't let him see what you've 
                         got.

               Sean nods. Will walks in. Everyone stands to greet Will.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello, Will. Any trouble finding the 
                         place?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, 
                         Will Hunting.

               Sean and Will nod. An awkward moment as the four men stand.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, let's get started.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, let's let the healing begin.

               Lambeau is slightly embarrassed. Sean smiles at Will's joke.

                                     SEAN
                         Would you excuse us?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Tom.

                                     SEAN
                         You too, Gerry.

               Lambeau looks at Sean, surprised. Sean's stare is unwavering.

               After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will 
               alone. Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second. He 
               seems more interested in the room. There is a long silence 
               as Sean watches Will.

                                     SEAN
                         Hello, Will. I'm Sean Maguire.

               A smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and 
               sits.

               He lights a cigarette. Sean continues to watch him. Finally-

                                     SEAN
                         Where are you from in Southie?

                                     WILL
                         Did you buy all these books retail, 
                         or do you send away for like a "shrink 
                         kit" that comes with all these volumes 
                         included?

                                     SEAN
                         Have you read all these books, Will?

                                     WILL
                         Probably not.

                                     SEAN
                              (indicating a shelf)
                         How about the ones on that shelf?

               Will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I read those.

                                     SEAN
                         What did you think?

                                     WILL
                         I'm not here for a fuckin' book 
                         report.  They're your books, why 
                         don't you read 'em?

                                     SEAN
                         I did.

                                     WILL
                         That must have taken you a long time.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah, it did take me a long time.

               Sean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident 
               manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair 
               and goes to the shelf.

                                     WILL
                              (looking at book)
                         "A History of the United States, 
                         Volume I." If you want to read a 
                         real history book, read Howard Zinn's 
                         "A People's History of the United 
                         States." That book will knock you on 
                         your ass.

                                     SEAN
                         How about Noam Chomsky's 
                         "Manufacturing Consent?"

                                     WILL
                         You people baffle me. You spend all 
                         this money on beautiful, fancy books-- 
                         and they're the wrong fuckin' books.

                                     SEAN
                         You think so?

                                     WILL
                         Whatever blows your hair back.

               Will returns to his chair. Pause.

                                     SEAN
                              (indicating cigarette)
                         Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much.
                         Stunt your growth.

                                     WILL
                         You're right. It really gets in the 
                         way of my jazzercizing.

               Sean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He 
               remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his 
               face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence.

                                     WILL
                         Do you lift?

                                     SEAN
                         Yes, I do.

                                     WILL
                         Nautilus?

                                     SEAN
                         Free weights.

                                     WILL
                         Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?

                                     SEAN
                         285. 

                                     WILL
                         Oh.

               Will gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's 
               painting. It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous 
               storm -- by no means a masterpiece. Will studies it.

                                     WILL
                         You paint this?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah. Do you paint?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         Crayons?

                                     WILL
                         This is a real piece of shit.

                                     SEAN
                         Tell me what you really think.

                                     WILL
                         Poor color composition, lousy use of 
                         space. But that shit doesn't really 
                         concern me.

                                     SEAN
                         What does?

                                     WILL
                         The color here, see how dark it is? 
                         It's interesting.

                                     SEAN
                         What is?

                                     WILL
                         I think you're one step away from 
                         cutting your ear off.

                                     SEAN
                         Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?

                                     WILL
                         You ever heard the saying, "any port 
                         in a storm?"

                                     SEAN
                         Sure, how 'bout "still waters run 
                         deep"-

                                     WILL
                         --Well, maybe that means you.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe what mea--

                                     WILL
                         Maybe you were in the middle of a 
                         storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the 
                         waves were crashing over the bow, 
                         the Goddamned mast was about to snap, 
                         and you were crying for the harbor. 
                         So you did what you had to do, to 
                         get out.  Maybe you became a 
                         psychologist.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe you should be a patient and 
                         sit down.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe you married the wrong woman.

                                     SEAN
                         Watch your mouth.

                                     WILL
                         That's it isn't it? You married the 
                         wrong woman. She leave you? Was she 
                         bangin' someone else?

               Sean is walking slowly towards Will.

                                     WILL
                         How are the seas now, D--

               In a flash, Sean has Will by the throat. Will is helpless.

                                     SEAN
                         If you ever disrespect my wife 
                         again... I will end you.

                                     WILL
                         Time's up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               Will walks out of Sean's office past Lambeau and Tom who are 
               sitting in the hallway.

                                     WILL
                         At ease, gentlemen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean stands behind his desk in his office, still very much 
               on edge. Lambeau walks in.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Five minutes, Sean. Are you okay?

               A pause, Sean is staring at his painting.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll understand if you don't want to 
                         meet with him again.

                                     SEAN
                         Thursday, four o'clock. Make sure 
                         the kid is here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WONDERLAND RACETRACK -- DAY

               Will and Skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run. 
               They ad lib teasing one another about England, Ireland, and 
               America.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You grew up around here?

                                     WILL
                         Not far from here, South Boston.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How was that?

                                     WILL
                         Pretty boring, I guess.

               She smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I bet you have a great family.

                                     WILL
                         You know, nothing special.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You have a lot of brothers and 
                         sisters?

                                     WILL
                         Do I have a lot of brothers and 
                         sisters?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah.

                                     WILL
                         Well, Irish Catholic. What do you 
                         think?

                                     SKYLAR
                         How many?

                                     WILL
                         You wouldn't believe me if I told 
                         you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What, five?

               Will shakes his head.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Seven?

               Will shakes his head. Smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come on.

                                     WILL
                         I have twelve big brothers.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Not a chance.

                                     WILL
                         Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Bullshit.

                                     WILL
                         I swear to God.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Your house must have been a zoo.

                                     WILL
                         It was great. There was always someone 
                         to play with, give you advice.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Do you know all their names?

                                     WILL
                         'Course I do, they're my brothers.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well...

                                     WILL
                         Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, 
                         Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, 
                         Johnny, and Brian.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughing)
                         Do you keep in touch with them?

                                     WILL
                         All the time. We all live in Southie. 
                         I live with three of them now.

               Skylar smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I want to meet them.

                                     WILL
                         We'll do that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               As we pan across Sean's small apartment, we find it strewn 
               with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes. Although, if 
               it weren't for the clutter, the place would feel pretty bare. 
               A framed SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover featuring a screaming Larry 
               Bird and entitled "CELTIC PRIDE" hangs on the wall. Sean 
               sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of 
               BUSHMILL'S IRISH WHISKEY. He is deep in thought.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will strolls into the office. Sean is waiting there behind 
               his desk. He seems different. More calm. Will and Sean stare 
               at each other for a long moment.

                                     WILL
                         You again. How the paintin' coming?

               Sean stands up.

                                     SEAN
                         Come with me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOSTON COMMON -- MINUTES LATER

               Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park.

               They look out over a small pond, in which a group of 
               schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats.

                                     WILL
                         So what's with this place? You have 
                         a swan fetish? Is this something 
                         you'd like to talk about?

                                     SEAN
                         I was thinking about what you said 
                         to me the other day, about my 
                         painting. I stayed up half the night 
                         thinking about it and then something 
                         occurred to me and I fell into a 
                         deep peaceful sleep and haven't 
                         thought about you since. You know 
                         what occurred to me?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         You're just a boy. You don't have 
                         the faintest idea what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     WILL
                         Why thank you.

                                     SEAN
                         You've never been out of Boston.

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         So if I asked you about art you could 
                         give me the skinny on every art book 
                         ever written... Michelangelo? You 
                         know a lot about him I bet. Life's 
                         work, criticisms, political 
                         aspirations. But you couldn't tell 
                         me what it smells like in the Sistine 
                         Chapel. You've never stood there and 
                         looked up at that beautiful ceiling. 
                         And if I asked you about women I'm 
                         sure you could give me a syllabus of 
                         your personal favorites, and maybe 
                         you've been laid a few times too.
                         But you couldn't tell me how it feels 
                         to wake up next to a woman and be 
                         truly happy. If I asked you about 
                         war you could refer me to a bevy of 
                         fictional and non-fictional material, 
                         but you've never been in one. You've 
                         never held your best friend's head 
                         in your lap and watched him draw his 
                         last breath, looking to you for help. 
                         And if I asked you about love I'd 
                         get a sonnet, but you've never looked 
                         at a woman and been truly vulnerable. 
                         Known that someone could kill you 
                         with a look. That someone could rescue 
                         you from grief. That God had put an 
                         angel on Earth just for you.  And 
                         you wouldn't know how it felt to be 
                         her angel. To have the love be there 
                         for her forever. Through anything, 
                         through cancer. You wouldn't know 
                         about sleeping sitting up in a 
                         hospital room for two months holding 
                         her hand and not leaving because the 
                         doctors could see in your eyes that 
                         the term "visiting hours" didn't 
                         apply to you. And you wouldn't know 
                         about real loss, because that only 
                         occurs when you lose something you 
                         love more than yourself, and you've 
                         never dared to love anything that 
                         much. I look at you and I don't see 
                         an intelligent confident man, I don't 
                         see a peer, and I don't see my equal. 
                         I see a boy. Nobody could possibly 
                         understand you, right Will? Yet you 
                         presume to know so much about me 
                         because of a painting you saw.  You 
                         must know everything about me.  You're 
                         an orphan, right?

               Will nods quietly.

                                     SEAN
                         Do you think I would presume to know 
                         the first thing about who you are 
                         because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I 
                         don't buy the argument that you don't 
                         want to be here, because I think you 
                         like all the attention you're getting. 
                         Personally, I don't care. There's 
                         nothing you can tell me that I can't 
                         read somewhere else.  Unless we talk 
                         about your life. But you won't do 
                         that. Maybe you're afraid of what 
                         you might say.

               Sean stands,

                                     SEAN
                         It's up to you.

               And walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie doing demo at the site. They throw 
               cinderblocks out a window into a pile. They are filthy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- NIGHT

               Rain pounds South Boston. Chuckie sits with the Cadillac 
               fiddling, humming to the radio. Morgan and Billy sit in the 
               back, sharing a case of beer. Will is at a pay phone.

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     SKYLAR
                         Hello?

               Will hangs up and runs back to the car, soaked.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Who'd you call?

                                     WILL
                         No one. I didn't have the number.

                                     MORGAN
                         What are you, retarded? You went all 
                         the way out there in the rain and 
                         you didn't have the number?

                                     WILL
                         No, it was your mother's 900 number. 
                         I just ran out of quarters.

               Laughter. Chuckie pulls away from the curb.

                                     MORGAN
                         Why don't we get off mothers, I just 
                         got off yours.

               There is a long moment of silence in response to Morgan's 
               attempt at levity. Then laughter.

                                     BILLY
                         You're a pretty funny guy. Here, 
                         have a nickel.

               Billy WHIPS his EMPTY BEER CAN off of Morgan's head.

                                     MORGAN
                         Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what 
                         happens.

                                     BILLY
                         All right, then.

                                     MORGAN
                         Watch what happens.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from Sean completely silent and takes out a 
               pack of cigarettes.

                                     SEAN
                         No smoking.

               Will puts the cigarettes away. Sean stares at Will and 
               occasionally at the clock. Sean continues to check the clock 
               on the wall. It is the only clock in the room and it is BEHIND 
               Will. Their hour is almost up.

               CLOSE ON: WILL'S EYES INTERCUT WITH THE CLOCK.

               He is counting seconds. As the second hand crosses the twelve, 
               Will stands up and walks out, leaving Sean alone.

               INT. HALLWAY -- LATER

               Lambeau and Sean walk down the hallway after the session.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What do you mean "he didn't talk?" 
                         You sat there for an hour?

                                     SEAN
                         No, he just sat there and counted 
                         the seconds until the session was 
                         over. It was pretty impressive, 
                         actually.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Why would he do that?

                                     SEAN
                         To show me he doesn't have to talk 
                         to me if he doesn't want to.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring 
                         contest between two kids from the 
                         "old neighborhood?"

                                     SEAN
                         I won't talk first.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- EVENING

               Chuckie drops Will off at his apartment, watches him [Will] 
               walk up the steps.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               Chuckie pulls up to the curb and walks up the steps to Will's 
               front door. After a beat, Will emerges. They get back in 
               [the car].

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie at work. Chuckie shows Will how to be a 
               man.

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- NIGHT

               The bar is a bit more crowded than usual. Will and Chuckie 
               walk back to their table, carrying beers. They pass a table 
               of GIRLS, local regulars getting just as bombed as the guys. 
               These girls are a little overdone. Too much make-up, too 
               much hairspray, and too much body for such tight outfits. 
               One of the girls, KRYSTYN, smiles at Will who seems subdued.

                                     KRYSTYN
                         Hi, Will.

                                     WILL
                         How you doin', Krystyn.

               They pass the table of girls. Chuckie looks at one, ruefully.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I didn't get on Cathy last night.

                                     WILL
                         Why not?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I don't know.

               Chuckie turns back to one of the girls, calling out:

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Cathy! Why didn't you give me none 
                         of your twat last night?

               A girl at the table, CATHY, holds up her PINKY FINGER and 
               smiles -- revealing a mouthful of MISSING TEETH.

                                     CATHY
                         Fuck you and your Irish curse, 
                         Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         She's missin' teeth, Will.

               Will nods, not really into it tonight.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Plus, it's like, five to two Morgan 
                         ends up marryin' her. There's only 
                         so many times you can bang your 
                         friend's future wife...

               They get to the table. Will's heart just isn't in it.

                                     WILL
                         I'm takin' off.

                                     ALL
                         We're goin' late night.

                                     WILL
                         I'm tired.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will and Lambeau work together at the board. They communicate 
               non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem. After a 
               particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look 
               and laugh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will and Sean sit in silence. A long moment passes. Sean 
               casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. Will restlessly 
               looks around the room and then back to Sean. An odd half 
               smile crosses Sean's face. After a moment:

                                     WILL
                         You know, I was on this plane once. 
                         And I'm sittin' there and the captain 
                         comes on and is like "we'll be 
                         cruising at 35,000 feet," and does 
                         his thing, then he puts the mike 
                         down but forgets to turn it off. 
                         Then he says "man, all I want right 
                         now is a blow-job and a cup of 
                         coffee."  So the stewardess goes 
                         runnin' up towards the cock-pit to 
                         tell him the mike's still on, and 
                         this guy in the back of the plane 
                         goes "don't forget the coffee!"

                                     SEAN
                              (smiles)
                         You've never been on a plane.

                                     WILL
                         I know, but the joke's better if I 
                         tell it in the first person.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         I have been laid you know.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah? You got a lady now?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I went on a date last week.

                                     SEAN
                         How'd it go?

                                     WILL
                         Fine.

                                     SEAN
                         Well, are you going out again?

                                     WILL
                         I don't know.

                                     SEAN
                         Why not?

                                     WILL
                         Haven't called her.

                                     SEAN
                         Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.

                                     WILL
                         I know what I'm doing. She's different 
                         from the other girls I met. We have 
                         a really good time. She's smart, 
                         beautiful, fun...

                                     SEAN
                         So Christ, call her up.

                                     WILL
                         Why? So I can realize she's not so 
                         smart. That she's boring. You don't 
                         get it. Right now she's perfect, I 
                         don't want to ruin that.

                                     SEAN
                         And right now you're perfect too. 
                         Maybe you don't want to ruin that.

               Will says nothing.

                                     SEAN
                         Well, I think that's a great 
                         philosophy Will, that way you can go 
                         through your entire life without 
                         ever having to really know anybody.

               Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife used to turn the alarm clock 
                         off in her sleep. I was late for 
                         work all the time because in the 
                         middle of the night she'd roll over 
                         and turn the damn thing off. 
                         Eventually I got a second clock and 
                         put it under my side of the bed, but 
                         it got to where she was gettin' to 
                         that one too. She was afraid of the 
                         dark, so the closet light was on all 
                         night. Thing kept me up half the 
                         night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep, 
                         out of sheer exhaustion and not wake 
                         up when I was supposed to cause she'd 
                         have already gotten to my alarms.

               Will smiles, Sean takes a beat.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's been dead two years, Will. 
                         And when I think about her, those 
                         are the things I think about most. 
                         Little idiosyncrasies that only I 
                         knew about.  Those made her my wife. 
                         And she had the goods on me too. 
                         Little things I do out of habit. 
                         People call these things imperfections 
                         Will. It's just who we are. And we 
                         get to choose who we're going to let 
                         into out weird little worlds. You're 
                         not perfect. And let me save you the 
                         suspense, this girl you met isn't 
                         either. The question is, whether or 
                         not you're perfect for each other.  
                         You can know everything in the world, 
                         but the only way you're findin' that 
                         one out is by giving it a shot. You 
                         sure won't get the answer from an 
                         old fucker like me. And even if I 
                         did know, I wouldn't tell you.

               Will smiles. A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Why not? You told me every other 
                         fuckin' thing. You talk more than 
                         any shrink I ever met.

               Sean laughs.

                                     SEAN
                         I teach this shit, I didn't say I 
                         knew how to do it.

                                     WILL
                         You ever think about gettin' 
                         remarried?

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's dead.

                                     WILL
                         Hence, the word remarried.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's dead.

                                     WILL
                         Well I think that's a wonderful 
                         philosophy, Sean. That way you can 
                         go through the rest of your life 
                         without having to really know anyone.

               A beat. Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Time's up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

               Will is waiting outside the door for someone to come out -- 
               so he can go in.

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

               The door to Skylar's dorm is partially open. Will stands 
               outside while Skylar remains on the threshold.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Where have you been?

                                     WILL
                         I'm sorry, I been real busy.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You were busy? You know, I really 
                         was waiting for you to call me.

                                     WILL
                         Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another 
                         crack at it. Let me take you out.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You should have called. I have an "O-
                         chem" lab due tomorrow and it's 
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         It's not an excuse dummy. I want to 
                         go out with you. But look:

               She holds up her Lab. Will glances at it.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Tomorrow?

                                     WILL
                         Promise?

                                     SKYLAR
                         If you bring the caramels.

               Will smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- LATER

               Will sits in an outdoor cafe, thinking. After a beat, he 
               leans over to two students working at a nearby table, borrows 
               a pen and paper and starts writing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

               Will is a solitary figure strolling across the lawn. He stops 
               at Skylar's dorm and knocks on the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

               She emerges. He hands her the paper he was working on. It is 
               her O-chem lab.

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How the hell did you do that?

                                     WILL
                         Didn't your mother ever tell you not 
                         to look a gift horse in the mouth?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I'm supposed to understand this.

                                     WILL
                         You're not going into surgery tomorrow 
                         are you?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No.

                                     WILL
                         Then let's go have some fun.

               With a smile, she relents.

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean and Will in session.

                                     SEAN
                         Really? How'd the date go?

                                     WILL
                         Do you still counsel veterans?
                              (beat)
                         I read your book last night.

                                     SEAN
                         No, I don't.

                                     WILL
                         Why not?

                                     SEAN
                         I gave that up when my wife got sick.

                                     WILL
                         Is that why you didn't write anything 
                         else?

                                     SEAN
                              (smiles)
                         I didn't write anything else 'cause 
                         nobody, including most of my 
                         colleagues bothered to read the first 
                         one.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I've read you colleagues. Your 
                         book was good, Sean.
                              (beat)
                         All those guys were in your platoon?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     WILL
                         What happened to that guy from 
                         Kentucky?

                                     SEAN
                         Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I 
                         kind of lost touch with him after 
                         Nancy got sick.

                                     WILL
                         Do you ever wonder what your life 
                         would be like if you never met your 
                         wife?

                                     SEAN
                         What? Do I wonder if I'd be better 
                         off if I never met my wife?

               Will starts to clarify his question.

                         No, that's okay. It's an important 
                         question. 'Cause you'll have your 
                         bad times, which wake you up to the 
                         good stuff you weren't paying 
                         attention to.  And you can fail, as 
                         long as you're trying hard. But 
                         there's nothing worse than regret.

                                     WILL
                         You don't regret meetin' your wife?

                                     SEAN
                         Why? Because of the pain I feel now? 
                         I have regrets Will, but I don't 
                         regret a singel day I spent with 
                         her.

                                     WILL
                         When did you know she was the one?

                         October 21, 1975. Game six of the 
                         World Series. Biggest game in Red 
                         Sox history, Me and my friends slept 
                         out on the sidewalk all night to get 
                         tickets. We were sitting in a bar 
                         waiting for the game to start and in 
                         walks this girl.  What a game that 
                         was. Tie game in the bottom of the 
                         tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, 
                         hit a long fly ball down the left 
                         field line. Thirty-five thousand 
                         fans on their feet, screamin' at the 
                         ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' 
                         up the baseline, wavin' at the ball 
                         like a madman. It hits the foul pole, 
                         home run. Thirty-five thousand people 
                         went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.

                                     WILL
                         Where were you?

                                     SEAN
                         I was havin' a drink with my future 
                         wife.

                                     WILL
                         You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to 
                         have a drink with a woman you had 
                         never met?

                                     SEAN
                         That's right.

                                     WILL
                         So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't 
                         won a World Series since nineteen 
                         eighteen, you slept out for tickets, 
                         games gonna start in twenty minutes, 
                         in walks a girl you never seen before, 
                         and you give your ticket away?

                                     SEAN
                         You should have seen this girl. She 
                         lit up the room.

                                     WILL
                         I don't care if Helen of Troy walked 
                         into that bar! That's game six of 
                         the World Series!

               Sean smiles.

                                     WILL
                         And what kind of friends are these? 
                         They let you get away with that?

                                     SEAN
                         I just slid my ticket across the 
                         table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta 
                         go see about a girl."

                                     WILL
                         "I gotta go see about a girl"? What 
                         did they say?

                                     SEAN
                         They could see that I meant it.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.

                                     SEAN
                         No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I 
                         had gone to see that game I'd be in 
                         here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a 
                         bar twenty years ago. And how I always 
                         regretted not goin' over there and 
                         talkin' to her. I don't regret the 
                         eighteen years we were married. I 
                         don't regret givin' up counseling 
                         for six years when she got sick. I 
                         don't regret being by her side for 
                         the last two years when things got 
                         real bad. And I sure as Hell don't 
                         regret missing that damn game.

               A beat. Will is impressed.

                                     WILL
                         Would have been nice to catch that 
                         game though.

                                     SEAN
                              (breaking)
                         Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was 
                         gonna hit the home run.

               They laugh.

                                                          TIME DISSOLVE TO:

               INT LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               The office is more crowded than usual. TOM and THREE of 
               LAMBEAU'S COLLEAGUES including the esteemed ALEXANDER PEKEC 
               are in the room. Will sits at a work-station which projects 
               a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard. Lambeau stands 
               beside the projected image at the board arguing with Pekec, 
               a foreign mathematician. The image is of a Ramses graph binary 
               tree.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Alexander, I know your theory. The 
                         boy is updating, he's strategy 
                         stealing...

                                     PEKEC
                         With a Ramses graph on the binary 
                         tree--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --But what he's doing, he's attaching 
                         an edge to the adjacent vertex. He 
                         can always failsafe to either side--

                                     PEKEC
                         Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!

               Pekec starts writing lines beside Will's proof on the board.

                                     PEKEC
                         But I can always garbage out
                              (writes frantically)
                         All the way to "N" to the minus one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, there's a limit.

                                     PEKEC
                         The limit is not found!
                              (turns to Will)
                         The limit is not found.

                                     WILL
                         But I can always go to the other 
                         side.

                                     PEKEC
                         There is no proof--

               Lambeau can no longer contain himself.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is 
                         three to the K times--

                                     PEKEC
                         --But--

                                     WILL
                         Look, I wrote it down.

               They turn to Will who places his proof on the projector. The 
               image is cast over their faces. It reads:

               As Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him:

                                     WILL
                         It's just simpler this way.

               Lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Alexander, your theory is changed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Will and Skylar in her room, post coital. They are wrapped 
               in a sheet. Will is absent-mindedly playing the memory game 
               SIMON.

               The pattern grows increasingly complex. After a beat:

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why do we always stay here?

                                     WILL
                         'Cause it's nicer than my place.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I've never seen your place.

                                     WILL
                         Exactly.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What about your friends? Or your 
                         brothers? When do I get to meet them?

                                     WILL
                         They don't come over here that much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I think I can make it to South Boston.

                                     WILL
                         Aah, it's kind of a hike.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is it me you're hiding from them or 
                         the other way around?

                                     WILL
                         All right, all right. We'll go.

                         When?

                                     WILL
                         Sometime. I don't know. Next week.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What if I said I wouldn't sleep with 
                         you again until you let me meet your 
                         friends?

                                     WILL
                         I'd say...

                         You men are shameful. If you're not 
                         thinking of your wiener then you're 
                         acting on its behalf.

                                     WILL
                         Then on behalf of my wiener, I'd 
                         like to ask for an advance.

               entertainment.

               Everyone here is having fun including Sylar.

                         Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity 
                         that we'd be out drinkin'.

                         Guy's tryin' to walk the line -- but 
                         he can't even fuckin' stand up, and 
                         so my uncle's gonna spend a night in 
                         jail.  Just then there's this fuckin' 
                         BOOM like fifty yards down the road. 
                         Some guy's car hit a tree.

                                     MORGAN
                         Some other guy?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, he was probably drunker than 
                         my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the 
                         cop goes "Stay here" And he goes 
                         runnin' down the highway to deal 
                         with the other crash. So, my Uncle 
                         Marty's standin' on the side of the 
                         road for a little while, and he's so 
                         fuckin' lit, that he forgets what 
                         he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck 
                         it." He gets in his car and drives 
                         home.

                                     MORGAN
                         Holy shit.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So in the morning, there's a knock 
                         on the door it's the Statie. So my 
                         Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" 
                         And the Statie's like "I pulled you 
                         over and you took off."  And my 
                         Uncle's like "I never seen you before 
                         in my life, I been home all night 
                         with my kids." And Statie's like 
                         "Let me get in your garage!" So he's 
                         like "All right, fine." He takes 
                         around the garage and opens the door --
                         and the Statie's cruiser is in my 
                         Uncle's garage.

                                     ALL
                         No way! You're kiddin'!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, he was so hammered that he drove 
                         the police cruiser home. Fuckin' 
                         lights and everything!

                                     MORGAN
                         Did your Uncle get arrested?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed 
                         he didn't do anything. The fuckin' 
                         guy had been drivin' around in my 
                         Uncle's car all night lookin' for 
                         the house.

               Everyone is laughing. Skylar speaks above the din.

                                     SKYLAR
                         There was this Irish guy, walking 
                         down the beach one day.

               She has everyone's attention. Will is nervous.

                                     SKYLAR
                         And he comes across a bottle, and 
                         this Genie pops out. The genie turns 
                         to the Irishman and says -- "You've 
                         released me from my prison, so I'll 
                         grant you three wishes." The Irish 
                         guy thinks for a minute and says 
                         "What I really want is a pint of 
                         Guiness that never empties."  And -- 
                         POOF! A bottle appears. He slams it 
                         down, and -- lo and behold -- it 
                         fills back up again.

               C/U of Will. Hoping the joke pans out.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, the Irish guy can't believe 
                         it. He drinks it again, and again -- 
                         BOOM!  It fills back up. So, while 
                         the Irish guy is marveling at his 
                         good fortune, The Genie is getting 
                         impatient, because it's hot and he 
                         wants to get on with his freedom. He 
                         says "Let's go, you have two more 
                         wishes." The Irish guy slams his 
                         drink again, it fills back up, he's 
                         still amazed. The Genie can't take 
                         it anymore. He says "Buddy, I'm 
                         boiling out here. What are your other 
                         two wishes?"
                              (beat)
                         The Irish guy looks at his drink, 
                         looks at the Genie and says... "I 
                         guess I'll have two more of these."

               The gang erupts with laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         It's a good thing no one's Irish 
                         here.

                                     MORGAN
                         I'm Irish.

               Chuckie, Will look at Morgan, baffled.

               EXT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER

               Everyone is walking out, saying good-bye. Chuckie goes over 
               to Will and Skylar.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I'm glad you came by, changed my 
                         opinion of Harvard people.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.

               Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know what the fuck you're 
                         doin'.  You're givin' us a ride.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do I look like, Al Cowlins?
                              (seriously)
                         You want to take my car, drop her 
                         off?

                                     WILL
                         I was countin' on it.

                                     MORGAN
                         Chuck, let's go.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' 
                         the car.

               Morgan mumbles something and staggers off. Billy follows 
               with an indifferent shrug.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks, Chuck.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Don't get too slap-happy, you're 
                         takin' me home first.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta 
                         the way.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Just 'cause you don't have to sleep 
                         in the one room palace, don't start 
                         thinkin' you're bad.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (to Will)
                         I thought you said you'd show me 
                         your place.

                                     WILL
                         Not tonight.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, not tonight. Not any other 
                         night.

               He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped 
               like a bad habit.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I wanted to meet your brothers...

               Chuckie gives Will a curious look.

                                     WILL
                         They're all sleepin' now.
                              (a beat, to Chuckie)
                         Let me get those keys.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FACULTY CLUB -- NIGHT

               A cocktail party is underway. Professors mingle with

               representatives from high tech companies. Lambeau stands 
               holding a drink and surrounded by several RECRUITERS. 
               Apparently he's the star of the show.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         What I want to know, Gerry, is when 
                         we get to meet this wonder-boy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         We're still working together, the 
                         boy's a little rough.

                                     RECRUITER #2
                         We've got our share of eccentric 
                         geniuses at Tri-tech. We know how to 
                         deal with that.

                                     RECRUITER #3
                         I think we all do.

               Laughter.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         If you're not exaggerating, Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty-
                         four when I told you I'd win the 
                         Field's medal within two years?

               More laughter.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         In that case the boy could run 
                         shipping for us, routing--

                                     RECRUITER #2
                         You say he doesn't have a diploma, 
                         but we'll

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         I don't need to see a driver's 
                         license.  I can think of three 
                         departments right now that he could 
                         head up for us.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         At ease, gentlemen. We're looking 
                         carefully at all our options.

                                     RECRUITER #3
                         All right, Gerry. Close to the vest.
                              (gives him his card)
                         Good luck with these vultures.

               He walks off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TIMMY'S TAP -- DAY

               Timmy's Tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the L Street 
               Bar. Sean is at the bar, telling a joke to TIMMY (45) the 
               owner of the place, and several other REGULARS.

                                     SEAN
                         So she goes runnin' up the aisle and 
                         I figure "fuck it" and I yell out 
                         "don't forget the coffee!

               The men erupt in laughter. MARTY, one of the regulars pipe 
               up.

                                     MARTY
                         Bullshit! You didn't say that!

               Timmy and Sean exchange a look.

                                     TIMMY
                         Jesus Christ, Marty. It's a joke.

               Lambeau enters, a bit overdressed in his sport coat and tie.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Not at all.

                                     SEAN
                         Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend 
                         of mine. We went to college together.

                                     TIMMY
                         Good to meet you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Pleasure to meet you.

                                     SEAN
                         Could we get a couple of sandwiches?
                              (beat, smiles)
                         Put it on my tab.

               Sean heads towards a table.

                                     TIMMY
                         You ever plan on payin' your tab?

                                     SEAN
                              (pulls out lottery 
                              ticket)
                         I got the winning numbers right here.

                                     TIMMY
                         What's the jackpot?

                                     SEAN
                         Twelve million.

                                     TIMMY
                         I don't think that'll cover it.

               Lambeau follows [Sean]. They sit.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're here quite a bit, then.

                                     SEAN
                         I live right around the corner.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You moved?

                                     SEAN
                         I been here a couple years.

               There is an awkward moment.

                                     SEAN
                         You wanted to talk about Will?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Seems like it's going well.

                                     SEAN
                         I think so.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, have you talked to him at all 
                         about his future?

                                     SEAN
                         We haven't really gotten into it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Maybe you should. My phone's been 
                         ringing off the hook with job offers.

                                     SEAN
                         Jobs doing what?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks.
                         The kind of place where a mind like 
                         Will's is given free reign.

                                     SEAN
                         That's great, Gerry, that there's 
                         interest -- But I'm not sure he's 
                         ready for that.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, I really don't think you 
                         understand--

                                     SEAN
                         What don't I understand?

               Timmy comes over with the sandwiches.

                                     SEAN
                         Thanks, Timmy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us?
                         We're trying to settle a bet.

                                     TIMMY
                         Uh-oh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you heard of Jonas Salk?

                                     TIMMY
                         Yeah, cured polio.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You've heard of Albert Einstein?

               Timmy smiles. Gives him a look.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard 
                         of him?

                                     TIMMY
                         No.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay thank you, Timmy.

                                     TIMMY
                         So who won the bet?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I did.

               A beat. Timmy leaves.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This isn't about me. I'm nothing 
                         compared to this young man.
                              (beat)
                         Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of 
                         Professors who were renowned for 
                         their study of the universe. But it 
                         was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk, 
                         doing physics in his spare time, who 
                         changed the world, Sean. Can you 
                         imagine if Einstein had given that 
                         up? Or gotten drunk with his buddies 
                         in Vienna every night? All of us 
                         would have lost something. And I'm 
                         quite sure Timmy never would have 
                         heard of him.

                                     SEAN
                         Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He 
                         just hasn't got the direction. We 
                         can give that to him.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         He married his cousin.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Who?

                                     SEAN
                         Einstein. Had two marriages, both 
                         trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his 
                         kids, one of whom, I think, ended up 
                         in an asylum- possible Unabomber 
                         addition--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You see, Sean? That's exactly not 
                         the point. No one remembers that. 
                         They--

                                     SEAN
                         I do.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, you're the only one.

               Beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This boy can make contributions to 
                         the world. We can help him do that.

                                     SEAN
                         Just... take it easy, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look, I don't know what else I can 
                         say.  I'm not sitting at home every 
                         night, twisting my mustache and 
                         hatching a plan to ruin the boy's 
                         life. But it's important to start 
                         early. I was doing advanced 
                         mathematics at eighteen and it still 
                         took me twenty-three years to do 
                         something worthy of a Field's medal.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe he doesn't care about that.

               A beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, this is important. And it's 
                         above personal rivalry--

                                     SEAN
                         Now wait a minute, Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, no you hear me out, Sean. This 
                         young man is a true prodigy--

                                     SEAN
                         Personal rivalry? I'm not getting 
                         back at you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look, you took one road and I took 
                         another. That's fine.

                                     SEAN
                         Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think 
                         it's fine with you. Give him time to 
                         figure out what he wants.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It 
                         worked wonders for you.

               A beat. Lambeau gets up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, I came here today out of 
                         courtesy.  I wanted to keep you in 
                         the loop. As we speak the boy is in 
                         a meeting I set up for him over at 
                         Tri-tech.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, OFFICE -- SAME

               Three well dressed TRI-TECH EXECUTIVES sit around a conference 
               table, which is littered with promotional brochures. The 
               executives exchange a confused look. One of them speaks.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                              (tentative)
                         Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure 
                         what you mean, we've already offered 
                         you a position..

               Cut to reveal: Chuckie sitting across from the executives, 
               hair combed down, wearing his Sunday best.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Since this is obviously not my first 
                         time in such altercations, let me 
                         say this:

               Chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating 
               "cash." The executives are baffled.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Look, we can do this the easy way or 
                         the hard way.

               The executives are completely blank.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         At the current time I am looking at 
                         a number of different fields from 
                         which to disseminate which offer is 
                         most pursuant aid to my benefit.
                              (a beat)
                         What do you want? What do I want? 
                         What does anybody want? Leniency.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I'm not sure--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         --These circumstances are mitigated.
                         Right now. They're mitigated.

               Chuckie puts his hands up, as if getting a vibe from the 
               room.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Okay...

               Chuckie points to the third executive.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         He knows what I'm talking about.

               The third executive is baffled.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         A retainer. Nobody in this town works 
                         without a retainer. You think you 
                         can find someone who does, you have 
                         my blessin'. But I think we all know 
                         that person isn't going to represent 
                         you as well as I can.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Will, our offer starts you at eighty-
                         four thousand a year, plus benefits.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Retainer...

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         You want us to give you cash right 
                         now?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Allegedly, what I am saying is your 
                         situation will be concurrently 
                         improved if I had two hundred sheets 
                         in my pocket right now.

               The executives exchange looks and go for their wallets.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I don't think I... Larry?

                         I have about seventy-three...

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Will you take a check?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Come now... what do you think I am, 
                         a juvenile? You don't got any money 
                         on you right now. You think I'm gonna 
                         take a check?

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         It's fine, John, I can cover the 
                         rest.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         That's right, you know.
                              (turns to #1)
                         He knows.

               Chuckie stands up and takes the money.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (to exec #1)
                         You're suspect. I don't know what 
                         your reputation is, but after the 
                         shit you tried to pull today, you 
                         can bet I'll be looking into it. Any 
                         conversations you want to have with 
                         me heretofore, you can have with my 
                         attorney. Gentlemen, keep your ears 
                         to the grindstone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AU BON PAIN COURTYARD, HARVARD SQUARE -- DAY

               Will and Skylar sit in the open courtyard of this Harvard 
               Square eatery. Skylar is working on another O-chem lab. Will 
               sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work.

                                     WILL
                         How's it goin'?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Fine.

                                     WILL
                         Want me to take a look?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No.

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go 
                         to the battin' cages.

                                     SKYLAR
                         It's important that I learn this.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it important to you? If I 
                         inherited all that money, the only 
                         thing important to me would be workin' 
                         on my swing.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Clearly.

                                     WILL
                         You're rich. What do you have to 
                         worry about?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Rich? I have an inheritance. It's 
                         two hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars.  That's exactly what it'll 
                         cost me, minus about five hundred 
                         bucks, to go all the way through med 
                         school. This is what I'm doing with 
                         that money. I could have done anything 
                         I wanted. I could have expanded my 
                         wardrobe, substantially.

                                     WILL
                         Instead you're going to bust your 
                         ass for five years so you can be 
                         broke?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No, so I can be a doctor.

               A beat. Will nods. She looks down, then up.

                                     SKYLAR
                         All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me 
                         ask you a question? Do you have a 
                         photographic memory?

                                     WILL
                         I guess. I don't know. How do you 
                         remember your phone number?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Have you ever studied Organic 
                         Chemistry?

                                     WILL
                         Some, a little.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Just for fun?

                                     WILL
                         I guess so.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Nobody does organic chemistry for 
                         "fun."  It's unnecessary. Especially 
                         for someone like you.

                                     WILL
                         Like me?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah. Someone like you who divides 
                         his time, fairly evenly, between the 
                         batting cages and bars.

               Will laughs.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How did you do that? I can't... I 
                         mean even the smartest people I know, 
                         and we do have a few at Harvard, 
                         have to study- a lot. It's hard.
                              (beat)
                         Listen, Will, if you don't want to 
                         tell me--

                                     WILL
                         Do you play the piano?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come one Will. I just want to know.

                                     WILL
                         I'm trying to explain it to you. So 
                         you play the piano. When you look at 
                         the keys, you see music, you see 
                         Mozart.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.

                                     WILL
                         Well all right, Beethoven. He looked 
                         at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' 
                         guy was deaf when he composed the 
                         Ode to Joy. They had to turn him 
                         around to take a bow because he 
                         couldn't hear the crowd going crazy 
                         behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all 
                         of that music in his head.

                                     SKYLAR
                         So, do you play the piano?

                                     WILL
                         Not a lick. I look at a piano and I 
                         see black and white keys, three pedals 
                         and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, 
                         they looked at it and it just made 
                         sense to them. They saw a piano and 
                         they could play. I couldn't paint 
                         you a picture, I probably can't hit 
                         the ball out of Fenway Park and I 
                         can't play the piano--

                                     SKYLAR
                         But you can do my O-chem lab in under 
                         an hour, you can--

                                     WILL
                         When it came to stuff like that I 
                         could always just play.

               Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will, the Robot-pimp. 
               So much so that Skylar has to kiss him, then push him away.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I can't believe it's taken me four 
                         years to meet you and I'm going to 
                         California in two months, Will.
                              (beat)
                         Have you ever been to California? I 
                         bet you'd like it.

               Will freezes. A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Maybe not.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHUCKIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Chuckie sits on his couch, watching cartoons in his boxers 
               and a tee-shirt, eating cereal. The doorbell rings. He sits.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Get it, ma!

               She doesn't. He gets up. Opens door. It's Skylar.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (surprised)
                         Hey.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Hi.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How you doin'?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Good.

               An awkward beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How'd you know where to find me?

                                     SKYLAR
                              (smiles)
                         You were the only Sullivan in the 
                         phone book.

               Chuckie smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will and I dropped you off here, 
                         remember?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh, right.

                                     SKYLAR
                         This is your house, right?

               Chuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted 
               by a nagging shriek from his mom.

                                     CHUCKIE'S MOM (O.S.)
                         Get in here, Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (calling back)
                         Pipe down, Ma!

                                     SKYLAR
                         I guess so.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What? No. This is my mother's house. 
                         I don't live with my mother. I just 
                         stop by, help out. I'm good like 
                         that.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is this a bad time?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         She'll live.
                              (beat)
                         If she starts yelling again I might 
                         have to run in real quick and beat 
                         her with the stick again but...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Let's take a walk.

               EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY

               Chuckie, still in his boxers walks with Skylar who is talking.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See, now this doesn't feel right.
                              (beat)
                         When I made the decision to come 
                         over here it felt right. I had all 
                         these rationalizations... I just 
                         don't understand why Will never tells 
                         me anything, he won't let me get 
                         close to him, he tells me these weird 
                         lies--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You caught that, huh?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I just wanted to find out what was 
                         going on... But now that I'm here it 
                         seems strange, doesn't it?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well, I don't have no trousers on...

               She laughs. A beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I know why you're here. Will don't 
                         talk much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't care what his family's like 
                         or if he doesn't have any brothers, 
                         but he doesn't have to lie to me.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I really don't know what to say. 
                         Look, I lie to women all the time. 
                         That's just my way.
                              (beat)
                         Last week Morgan brought these girls 
                         down from Roslindale. I told them I 
                         was a cosmonaut. They believed me. 
                         But Will's not usually like that--

                                     MAN ON PORCH
                         Put some clothes on, Sullivan!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Take it easy father!

               She laughs.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All I can say is; I known Will a 
                         long time -- And I seen him with 
                         every girl he's ever been with. But 
                         I've never seen him like this before, 
                         ever with anyone, like how he is 
                         with you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that true?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, it is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Tom and Will are sitting waiting for Lambeau.

                                     TOM
                         !!! !

                                     WILL
                         !!! !

               Lambeau enters going over a thick proof Will has completed.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is correct. I see you used 
                         Mclullen here--

                                     WILL
                         I don't know what it's called.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --This can't be right.
                              (examining proof)
                         This is going to be very embarrassing.
                         Have you ever considered--

                                     WILL
                         I'm pretty sure it's right.

               Will gets up to leave.

                                     WILL
                              (turning back)
                         Can I ask you a favor, can we do 
                         this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I 
                         leave work to come here and the 
                         fuckin' commute is killin' me--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's fine, but did you ever think--

                                     WILL
                         It's right.
                              (a beat, heading out)
                         Take it home with you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, what happened at the Tri-tech 
                         meeting?

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. 
                         So I sent my chief negotiator.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, on your own time, you can do 
                         what you like. When I set up a 
                         meeting, with my associates, and you 
                         don't show up it reflects poorly on 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         Then don't set up any more meetings.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll cancel every meeting right now.
                         I'll give you a job myself. I just 
                         wanted you to see what was out there.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe I don't want to spend my life 
                         sittin' around and explaining shit 
                         to people.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The least you can do is show me a 
                         little appreciation.

                                     WILL
                              (indicates proof)
                         You know how fuckin' easy this is to 
                         me? This is a joke!
                              (crumples proof)
                         And I'm sorry you can't do this. I 
                         really am. 'Cause if you could I 
                         wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble 
                         around and fuck it up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sure, then you'd have more time to 
                         sit around and get drunk. Think of 
                         how many fights you could have been 
                         in by now.

               Will turns around reveling that he's lit the PROOF ON FIRE. 
               Will drops it on the floor. Lambeau drops to his knees and 
               puts it out. He looks up at Will.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're right, Will. I can't do that 
                         proof and you can. And when it comes 
                         to this there are only twenty people 
                         in the world that can tell the 
                         difference between you and me. But 
                         I'm one of them.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I'm sorry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So am I.
                              (beat)
                         Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I 
                         wish I never met you. Because then I 
                         could sleep at night. I wouldn't 
                         have to walk around with the knowledge 
                         that someone like you was out there. 
                         And I wouldn't have to watch you 
                         throw it all away.

               Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the 
               wrinkled proof. He picks it up, smooths it out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar lie in bed. Skylar watches Will sleep. She 
               gets up and goes to the fridge. Returning to the bed:

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will? Are you awake?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come with me to California.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I want you to come with me.

                                     WILL
                         How do you know that?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I know. I just do.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, but how do you know?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't know. I just feel it.

                                     WILL
                         And you're sure about that?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah, I'm sure.

                                     WILL
                         'Cause that's a serious thing you're 
                         sayin'. I mean, we might be in 
                         California next week and you could 
                         find out somethin' about me that you 
                         don't like. And you might feel like 
                         "hey this is a big mistake."
                              (getting upset)
                         But you can't take it back, 'cause 
                         you know it's real serious and you 
                         can't take somethin' like that back. 
                         Now I'm in California, 'cause you 
                         asked me to come. But you don't really 
                         want me there. And I'm stuck in 
                         California with someone who really 
                         doesn't want me there and just wishes 
                         they had a take-back.

                                     SKYLAR
                         "Take-back?" What is that? I don't 
                         want a take-back. I want you to come 
                         to California with me.

                                     WILL
                         I can't go out to California.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why not?

                                     WILL
                         One, because I have a job here and 
                         two because I live here--

                                     SKYLAR
                              (beat)
                         Look, Will if you're not in love 
                         with me, you can say that.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with 
                         you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Then what are you afraid of?

                                     WILL
                         What do you mean "What am I afraid 
                         of?"

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why won't you come with me? What are 
                         you so scared of?

                                     WILL
                         What am I scared of?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, what aren't you scared of?  
                         You live in your safe little world 
                         where nobody challenges you and you're 
                         scared shitless to do anything else--

                                     WILL
                         Don't tell me about my world. You're 
                         the one that's afraid. You just want 
                         to have your little fling with the 
                         guy from the other side of town and 
                         marry--

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that what you think--

                                     WILL
                         some prick from Stanford that your 
                         parents will approve of. Then you'll 
                         sit around with the rest of the upper 
                         crust kids and talk about how you 
                         went slummin' too.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I inherited that money when I was 
                         thirteen, when my father died.

                                     WILL
                         At least you have a mother.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Fuck you! You think I want this? 
                         That money's a burden to me. Every 
                         day I wake up and I wish I could 
                         give that back.  I'd give everything 
                         I have back to spend one more day 
                         with my father. But that's life. And 
                         I deal with it. So don't put that 
                         shit on me. You're the one that's 
                         afraid.

                                     WILL
                         What the fuck am I afraid of?!

                                     SKYLAR
                         You're afraid of me. You're afraid 
                         that I won't love you back. And guess 
                         what?  I'm afraid too. But at least 
                         I have the balls to it give it a 
                         shot. At least I'm honest with you.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not honest?

                                     SKYLAR
                         What about your twelve brothers?

                                     WILL
                         Oh, is that what this is about? You 
                         want to hear that I don't really 
                         have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' 
                         orphan? Is that what you want to 
                         hear?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?

                                     WILL
                         No, you don't want to hear that.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes, I do, Will.

                                     WILL
                         You don't want to hear that I got 
                         cigarettes put out on me when I was 
                         a little kid. That this isn't surgery.

               Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso.

                                     WILL
                         You don't want to hear that. Don't 
                         tell me you want to hear that shit!!

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes I do. Did you ever think that 
                         maybe I could help you? That maybe 
                         that's the point, that we're a team?

                                     WILL
                         What, you want to come in here and 
                         save me? Is that what you want to 
                         do? Do I have a sign that says "save 
                         me" on my back?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't want to "save" you. I just 
                         want to be with you. I love you. I 
                         love you!

               Will, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her.

                                     WILL
                         Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' 
                         bullshit me!

                                     SKYLAR
                              (standing up to him)
                         You know what I want to hear?  I 
                         want to hear that you don't love me. 
                         If you tell me that, then I'll leave 
                         you alone. I won't ask any questions 
                         and I won't be in your life.

               A beat. Will looks Skylar dead in the eye. Lowers his hand.

                                     WILL
                         I don't love you.

               He walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Will leaves pulling on his clothes.

               INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from two N.S.A. AGENTS, OLIVER DYTRESS and 
               ROBERT TAVANO. These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and 
               looking sharp in twin navy blue suits.

                                     WILL
                         So why do you think I should work 
                         for the National Security Agency?

                                     DYTRESS
                         Well, you'd be working on the cutting 
                         edge. You'd be exposed to the kind 
                         of technology you couldn't see 
                         anywhere else because we've classified 
                         it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, 
                         Advanced algorithms--

                                     WILL
                         Codebreaking.

                                     DYTRESS
                         That's one aspect of what we do.

                                     WILL
                         Come on, that's what you do. You 
                         handle more than eighty percent of 
                         the intelligence workload. You're 
                         seven times the size of the C.I.A.

                                     DYTRESS
                         That's exactly right, Will. So the 
                         question as I see it isn't "why should 
                         you work for N.S.A." it's "why 
                         shouldn't you?"

                                     WILL
                         Why shouldn't I work for the National 
                         Security Agency? That's a tough one.

               Will bites his tongue, trying to make this work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy 
               cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both 
               boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear 
               the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE 
               emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in 
                         my mom's room again I'm gonna give 
                         you a fuckin' beatin'!

               After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced.

                                     MORGAN
                              (innocently)
                         What's up guys?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Why don't you beat off at your house?

                                     MORGAN
                         I don't have a VCR at my house.

               Will pays no attention to this exchange

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I never cared about that.

               An awkward beat.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I love you, Will.
                              (pause)
                         No take-backs.

               Will says nothing.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will?

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Take care.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Goodbye.

               Will hangs up. Hold on him for an agonizing beat.

                         I can... I'm almost there.

               Will picks up a FRAME from Sean's desk. It is CARLTON FISK'S 
               BASEBALL CARD. Will has to smile. Lambeau looks up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What are you smiling at?

                         It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.

               Will can see that Lambeau wants more.

                         Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean 
                         told me. It's a long story.

               A beat.

                         can do at home.

               Will gets up.

                         excited about how the meeting went.

               Lambeau is excited. Will clearly is not.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                         I guess.

                         What did you think?

                         What did I think?

               A beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this.

                                     WILL
                         Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody 
                         puts a code on my desk, something 
                         nobody else can break. So I take a 
                         shot at it and maybe I break it. And 
                         I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I 
                         did my job well.  But maybe that 
                         code was the location of some rebel 
                         army in North Africa or the Middle 
                         East. Once they have that location, 
                         they bomb the village where the rebels 
                         were hiding and fifteen hundred people 
                         I never had a problem with get killed. 
                         (rapid fire) Now the politicians are 
                         sayin' "send in the Marines to secure 
                         the area" 'cause they don't give a 
                         shit. It won't be their kid over 
                         there, gettin' shot. Just like it 
                         wasn't them when their number got 
                         called, 'cause they were pullin' a 
                         tour in the National Guard. It'll be 
                         some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel 
                         in the ass.  And he comes home to 
                         find that the plant he used to work 
                         at got exported to the country he 
                         just got back from. And the guy who 
                         put the shrapnel in his ass got his 
                         old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen 
                         cents a day and no bathroom breaks. 
                         Meanwhile my buddy from Southie 
                         realizes the only reason he was over 
                         there was so we could install a 
                         government that would sell us oil at 
                         a good price. And of course the oil 
                         companies used the skirmish to scare 
                         up oil prices so they could turn a 
                         quick buck. A cute, little ancillary 
                         benefit for them but it ain't helping 
                         my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And 
                         naturally they're takin' their sweet 
                         time bringin' the oil back and maybe 
                         even took the liberty of hiring an 
                         alcoholic skipper who likes to drink 
                         seven and sevens and play slalom 
                         with the icebergs and it ain't too 
                         long 'til he hits one, spills the 
                         oil, and kills all the sea-life in 
                         the North Atlantic. So my buddy's 
                         out of work and he can't afford to 
                         drive so he's got to walk to the job 
                         interviews which sucks 'cause the 
                         shrapnel in his ass is givin' him 
                         chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile 
                         he's starvin' 'cause every time he 
                         tries to get a bite to eat the only 
                         blue-plate special they're servin' 
                         is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker 
                         State.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out 
                         for somethin' better. I figure I'll 
                         eliminate the middle man. Why not 
                         just shoot my buddy, take his job 
                         and give it to his sworn enemy, hike 
                         up gas prices, bomb a village, club 
                         a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and 
                         join the National Guard? Christ, I 
                         could be elected President.

                                     SEAN
                         Do you think you're alone?

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SEAN
                         Do you have a soul-mate?

                                     WILL
                         Define that.

                                     SEAN
                         Someone who challenges you in every 
                         way.  Who takes you places, opens 
                         things up for you. A soul-mate.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

               Sean waits.

                                     WILL
                         Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost, 
                         O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant--

                                     SEAN
                         They're all dead.

                                     WILL
                         Not to me, they're not.

                                     SEAN
                         But you can't give back to them, 
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Not without a heater and some serious 
                         smelling salts, no...

                                     SEAN
                         That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll 
                         never have that kind of relationship 
                         in a world where you're afraid to 
                         take the first step because all you're 
                         seeing are the negative things that 
                         might happen ten miles down the road.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, what? You're going to take the 
                         professor's side on this?

                                     SEAN
                         Don't give me your line of shit.

                                     WILL
                         I didn't want the job.

                                     SEAN
                         It's not about that job. I'm not 
                         saying you should work for the 
                         government. But, you could do anything 
                         you want. And there are people who 
                         work their whole lives layin' brick 
                         so their kids have a chance at the 
                         kind of opportunity you have. What 
                         do you want to do?

                                     WILL
                         I didn't ask for this.

                                     SEAN
                         Nobody gets what they ask for, Will.
                         That's a cop-out.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it a cop-out? I don't see 
                         anythin' wrong with layin' brick, 
                         that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. 
                         Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's 
                         gonna get to work the next day 'cause 
                         of me. There's honor in that.

                                     SEAN
                         You're right, Will. Any man who takes 
                         a forty minute train ride so those 
                         college kids can come in in the 
                         morning and their floors will be 
                         clean and their trash cans will be 
                         empty is an honorable man.

               A beat. Will says nothing.

                                     SEAN
                         And when they get drunk and puke in 
                         the sink, they don't have to see it 
                         the next morning because of you. 
                         That's real work, Will. And there is 
                         honor in that.  Which I'm sure is 
                         why you took the job.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         I just want to know why you decided 
                         to sneak around at night, writing on 
                         chalkboards and lying about it.
                              (beat)
                         'Cause there's no honor in that.

               Will is silent.

                                     SEAN
                         Something you want to say?

               Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

                                     SEAN
                         Why don't you come back when you 
                         have an answer for me.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SEAN
                         If you won't answer my questions, 
                         you're wasting my time.

                                     WILL
                         What?

               Will loses it, slams the door shut.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you!

               Sean has finally gotten to Will.

                                     WILL
                         Who the fuck are you to lecture me 
                         about life? You fuckin' burnout! 
                         Where's your "soul-mate?!"

               Sean lets this play out. Possible "shepard" change.

                                     WILL
                         Dead! She dies and you just cash in 
                         your chips. That's a fuckin' cop-
                         out!

                                     SEAN
                         I been there. I played my hand.

                                     WILL
                         That's right. And you fuckin' lost!  
                         And some people would have the sack 
                         to lose a big hand like that and 
                         still come back and ante up again!

                                     SEAN
                         Look at me. What do you want to do?

               A beat. Will looks up.

                                     SEAN
                         You and your bullshit. You got an 
                         answer for everybody. But I asked 
                         you a straight question and you can't 
                         give me a straight answer. Because 
                         you don't know.

               Sean goes to the door and opens it. Will walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie take crowbars to a wall. This is what they 
               do for a living. As they routinely hammer away, Will becomes 
               more involved in his battle with the wall. Plaster and lathing 
               fly as Will vents his rage. Chuckie, noticing, stops working 
               and takes a step back, watching Will. Will is oblivious.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Lambeau and Tom are in his office. Will is nowhere to be 
               seen.

               Lambeau is on the phone.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What I mean, Sean, is that I'm sitting 
                         in your office and the boy isn't 
                         here.
                              (beat)
                         Well, it's ten past three.
                              (beat)
                         An hour and ten minutes late.
                              (beat)
                         Well, if he doesn't show up and I 
                         have to file a report saying he wasn't 
                         here and he goes back to jail, it 
                         won't be on my conscience, Sean.
                              (beat)
                         Fine.

               He hangs up. Tom picks up a FORM up off the desk.

                                     TOM
                         What should I do?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The boy was here. He came in, sat 
                         down and we worked together.

               A blank look.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He came in, sat down, and we worked 
                         together.

                                     TOM
                         Okay.

               Tom understands, begins filling out the form.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HANRAHAN'S PACKAGE STORE -- LATER

               Will walks out carrying a brown bag. He is filthy, having 
               just knocked off work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- PARKING LOT

               Chuckie is sitting on the hood of his Cadillac, watching 
               Will across the street. Chuckie is covered in grime as well. 
               Will starts walking towards Chuckie. As he draws closer, he 
               heaves a can of Budweiser a good thirty yards, to Chuckie 
               who handles it routinely.

               Will takes a seat next to Chuckie and they crack open their 
               beers. Other workers file out of the site. They drink.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How's the woman?

                                     WILL
                         Gone.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         She went to Medical school in 
                         California.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Sorry, brother.
                              (beat)
                         I don't know what to tell ya. You 
                         know all the girls I been with. You 
                         been with 'em too, except for Cheryl 
                         McGovern which was a big mistake on 
                         your part brother...

                                     WILL
                         Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of 
                         us has herpes.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Some shows are worth the price of 
                         admission, partner.

               This gets a small laugh from Will.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         My fuckin' back is killin' me.

               A passing SHEET METAL WORKER overhears this.

                                     SHEET METAL WORKER
                         That's why you should'a gone to 
                         college.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal 
                         pussy.
                              (beat)
                         So, when are you done with those 
                         meetin's?

                                     WILL
                         Week after I'm twenty-one.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Are they hookin' you up with a job?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, sit in a room and do long 
                         division for the next fifty years.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yah, but it's better than this shit. 
                         At least you'd make some nice bank.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         It's a way outta here.

                                     WILL
                         What do I want a way outta here for?  
                         I want to live here the rest of my 
                         life. I want to be your next door 
                         neighbor. I want to take out kids to 
                         little league together up Foley Field.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Look, you're my best friend, so don't 
                         take this the wrong way, but in 20 
                         years, if you're livin' next door to 
                         me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin'
                         Patriots' games and still workin' 
                         construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. 
                         And that's not a threat, that's a 
                         fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.

                                     WILL
                         Chuckie, what are you talkin'...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Listen, you got somethin' that none 
                         of us have.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it always this? I owe it to 
                         myself? What if I don't want to?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow 
                         I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty 
                         and I'll still be doin' this. And 
                         that's all right 'cause I'm gonna 
                         make a run at it.  But you, you're 
                         sittin' on a winning lottery ticket 
                         and you're too much of a pussy to 
                         cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause 
                         I'd do anything to have what you 
                         got! And so would any of these guys.  
                         It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if 
                         you're still here in twenty years.

                                     WILL
                         You don't know that.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Let me tell you what I do know. Every 
                         day I come by to pick you up, and we 
                         go out drinkin' or whatever and we 
                         have a few laughs. But you know what 
                         the best part of my day is? The ten 
                         seconds before I knock on the door 
                         'cause I let myself think I might 
                         get there, and you'd be gone. I'd 
                         knock on the door and you wouldn't 
                         be there. You just left.

               A beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Now, I don't know much. But I know 
                         that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Lambeau stands across from Sean, seething.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is a disaster! I brought you in 
                         here to help me with this boy, not 
                         to run him out--

                                     SEAN
                         Now wait a minute--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --And confuse him--

                                     SEAN
                         --Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         And here I am for the second week in 
                         a row with my professional reputation 
                         at stake--

                                     SEAN
                         Hold on!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Ready to falsify documents because 
                         you've given him license to walk 
                         away from this.

                                     SEAN
                         I know what I'm doing and I know why 
                         I'm here!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look Sean, I don't care if you have 
                         a rapport with the boy -- I don't 
                         care if you have a few laughs -- 
                         even at my expense! But don't you 
                         dare undermine what I'm trying to do 
                         here.

                                     SEAN
                         "Undermine?"

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He has a gift and with that gift 
                         comes responsibility. And you don't 
                         understand that he's at a fragile 
                         point--

                                     SEAN
                         He is at a fragile point. He's got 
                         problems--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What problems does he have, Sean, 
                         that he is better off as a janitor 
                         or in jail or hanging around with--

                                     SEAN
                         Why do you think he does that, Gerry?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He can handle the work, he can handle 
                         the pressure and he's obviously 
                         handled you.

                                     SEAN
                         Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor?
                         Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because 
                         the first thing that happened to him 
                         was that he was abandoned by the 
                         people who were supposed to love him 
                         the most!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, come on, Sean--

                                     SEAN
                         And why does he hang out with his 
                         friends? Because any one of those 
                         kids would come in here and take a 
                         bat to your head if he asked them 
                         to. It's called loyalty!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, that's nice--

                                     SEAN
                         And who do you think he's handling?  
                         He pushes people away before they 
                         have a chance to leave him. And for 
                         20 years he's been alone because of 
                         that. And if you try to push him 
                         into this, it's going to be the same 
                         thing all over again. And I'm not 
                         going to let that happen to him!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now don't do that. Don't you do that!
                         Don't infect him with the idea that 
                         it's okay to quit. That it's okay to 
                         be a failure, because it's not okay! 
                         If you're angry at me for being 
                         successful, for being what you could 
                         have been--

                                     SEAN
                         --I'm not angry at you--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. 
                         And I'm not going to apologize for 
                         any success that I've had.

                                     SEAN
                         --I don't have any anger at you--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes you do. You're angry at me for 
                         doing what you could have done. Ask 
                         yourself if you want Will to feel 
                         that way for the rest of his life, 
                         to feel like a failure.

                                     SEAN
                         That's it. That's why I don't come 
                         to the goddamn reunions!  Because I 
                         can't stand the look in your eye 
                         when you see me! You think I'm a 
                         failure! I know who I am. I'm proud 
                         of who I am. And all of you, you 
                         think I'm some kind of pity case! 
                         You with your sycophant students 
                         following you around. And your Goddamn 
                         Medal!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is that what this is about, Sean? 
                         The Field's Medal? Do you want me to 
                         go home and get it for you? Then 
                         will you let the boy--

                                     SEAN
                         I don't want your trophy and I don't 
                         give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew 
                         you when!! You and Jack and Tom 
                         Sanders. I knew you when you were 
                         homesick and pimply-faced and didn't 
                         know what side of the bed to piss 
                         on!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right!  You were smarter than 
                         us then and you're smarter than us 
                         now! So don't blame me for how your 
                         life turned out. It's not my fault.

                                     SEAN
                         I don't blame you! It's not about 
                         that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause 
                         he's a good kid! And I won't see 
                         this happen to him- won't see you 
                         make him feel like a failure too!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He won't be a failure!

                                     SEAN
                         If you push him into something, if 
                         you ride him--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am 
                         today because I was pushed. And 
                         because I learned to push myself!

                                     SEAN
                         He's not you!

               A beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean turns 
               to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway.

                                     WILL
                         I can come back.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, that's fine, Will. I was just 
                         leaving.

               There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and 
               leaves.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I'm here.
                              (beat)
                         So, is that my problem? I'm afraid 
                         of being abandoned? That was easy.

                                     SEAN
                         Look, a lot of that stuff goes back 
                         a long way. And it's between me and 
                         him and it has nothing to do with 
                         you.

                                     WILL
                         Do you want to talk about it?

               Sean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk.

                                     WILL
                         What's that?

                                     SEAN
                         Oh, this is your file. I have to 
                         send it back to the Judge with my 
                         evaluation.

                                     WILL
                         You're not going to fail me are you?

               Sean smiles.

                                     WILL
                         So what's it say?

                                     SEAN
                         You want to read it?

                                     WILL
                         No.
                              (beat)
                         Have you had any experience with 
                         that?

                                     SEAN
                         Twenty years of counseling you see a 
                         lot of--

                                     WILL
                         No, have you had any experience with 
                         that?

                                     SEAN
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         It sure ain't good.

               INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

               From a child's P.O.V. we see a man, partially obscured by a 
               doorframe. The man turns toward the P.O.V.

                              (after a pause)
                         My dad used to make us walk down to 
                         the park and collect the sticks he 
                         was going to beat us with. Actually 
                         the worst of the beatings were between 
                         me and my brother. We would practice 
                         on each other trying to find sticks 
                         that would break.

                                     WILL
                         He used to just put a belt, a stick 
                         and a wrench on the kitchen table 
                         and say "choose."

               INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

               A large, callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick.

                                     WILL
                         I used to go with the wrench.

                         Cause fuck him, that's why.

               A long quiet moment.

                                     WILL
                         Is that why me and Skylar broke up?

                         I didn't know you had. Do you want 
                         to talk about that?
                              (beat)
                         I don't know a lot, Will. But let me 
                         tell you one thing. All this history,

                         Look here, son.

               Will, who had been looking away, loos at Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         This is not your fault.

                              (nonchalant)

               Sean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child. Will 
               sobs like a baby. After a moment, he wraps his arms around 
               Sean and holds him, even tighter. We pull back from this 
               image. Two lonely souls being father and son together.

               Will rides the Red Line, above ground. He looks out over the

               Will walks up to a nondescript building, he walks through 
               the glass doors, into the lobby.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Can I help you?

               The guard reaches for the phone.

                         Oh, Morgan.

               They both get up, in one another's face. This is a play fight.

               "You gonna start?" "You gonna pay my hospital bills?"

                         Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, 
                         dude.  I'd rather fight a big kid, 
                         they never fight, everyone's scared 
                         of 'em. You know how many people try 
                         to whip Morgan's ass every week? 
                         Fuckin' kid won't back down.

                         Shut the fuck up.

               Billy walks in the door and give Chuckie a look. Chuckie 
               turns to Will.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (To Will)
                         Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.

                                     MORGAN
                         You thought we forgot, didn't you? I 
                         know I'm gettin' my licks in.

               Laughter as the boys converge on Will. He goes willingly out 
               the door.

               EXT. L STREET -- CONTINUOUS

               As they come out the door, rather than beating Will 
               mercilessly, they stop. Morgan goes into his own, personal 
               rendition of "Danny Boy." No one joins in.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Shut up, Morgan.
                              (to Will)
                         Here's your present.

               Chuckie indicates an old CHEVY NOVA, parked illegally in 
               front of the bar.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, I figured now that you got 
                         your big job over in Cambridge, you 
                         needed some way to get over there 
                         and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you 
                         every day...

               Laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

                                     MORGAN
                         No I didn't...

               Will approaches the car to take a closer look.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         But you're twenty-one now, so--

                                     BILLY
                         Yeah, now that you can drink legally, 
                         we thought the best thing to get you 
                         was a car.

               More laughter. Will inspects the Nova.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.
                              (a beat)
                         This is the ugliest fuckin' car I 
                         ever seen in my life.

               Laughter, a beat.

                                     WILL
                              (serious)
                         How the fuck did you guys do this?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Me and Bill scraped together the 
                         parts, worked on it. Morgan was out 
                         panhandlin' every day.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose 
                         fuckin' router you think sanded out 
                         all that bondo?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Guy's been up my ass for two years 
                         about a fuckin' job. I had to let 
                         him help with the car.

                                     WILL
                         So, you finally got a job Morgan?

                                     MORGAN
                         Had one, now I'm fucked again.

                                     WILL
                              (to Chuckie)
                         So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai 
                         engine under there? Can I make it 
                         back to my house?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Fuck you. I re-built the engine 
                         myself.  That thing could make it to 
                         Hawaii if you wanted it to.

               Chuckie gives Will a look.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Happy 21, Will.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         Which one did you take, Will?

                                     WILL
                         Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs 
                         Professor Lambeau set me up with. I 
                         haven't told him yet, but I talked 
                         to my new boss over there and he 
                         seemed like a nice guy.

                                     SEAN
                         That's what you want?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I think so.

                                     SEAN
                         Good for you. Congratulations.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks you.

                         So, that's it? We're done?

                                     SEAN
                         We're done. You did your time. You're 
                         a free man.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         I just want you to know, Sean...

                                     SEAN
                         You're Welcome, Will.

                                     WILL
                         I'll keep in touch.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I 
                         don't know where I'll be.

               Will smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         I just... figured it's time I put my 
                         money back on the table, see what 
                         kind of cards I get.

               Will smiles. Sean hands him a piece of paper.

                                     SEAN
                         I'll be checking in with my machine 
                         at the college. If you ever need 
                         anything, just call.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Do what's in your heart, son. You'll 
                         be fine.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks you, Sean.

               They embrace.

                                     SEAN
                         No. Thank you.

                                     WILL
                              (re: embrace)
                         Does this violate the patient/doctor 
                         relationship?

                                     SEAN
                         Only if you grab my ass.

               They laugh.

                                     WILL
                         See ya.

                                     SEAN
                         Good luck.

               Both men smile.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SEAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

               Will comes out of Sean's office and sees Lambeau walking up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (surprised)
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, how you doin'?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You know, you're no longer required 
                         to come here.

                                     WILL
                         I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (a beat)
                         Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He 
                         says you start working for them next 
                         week.

               Will nods.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, that's, I think that's terrific.
                         Congratulations.

                         I just want you to know... It's been 
                         a pleasure.

                                     WILL
                         Bullshit.

               They laugh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This job... Do it if it's what you 
                         really want.

                                     WILL
                         I appreciate that.

               A moment. Will starts to go, Lambeau watches him for a beat, 
               Will turns back around.

                                     WILL

                         Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you 
                         need some help, or you get stuck 
                         again, don't be afraid to give me a 
                         call.

                         Thank you, Will. I'll do that.

               Will smiles, turns and walks away.

                         So I hear you're taking some time.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd 
                         travel some. Maybe write a little 
                         bit.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Where're you going?

                                     SEAN
                         I don't know. India maybe.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Why there?

                                     SEAN
                         Never been.

               Lambeau nods.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Do you know when you'll be back?

                                     SEAN
                              (picks up a flyer 
                              from his desk)
                         I got this mailer the other day. 
                         Class of Sixty-five is having this 
                         event in six months.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I got one of those too.

                                     SEAN
                         You should come. I'll buy you a drink.

               Lambeau smiles.

                         The drinks at those things are free.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Hell, I know that.

               Both men laugh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         How about one now?

                                     SEAN
                         Sounds good.

               They start to walk out.

                                     SEAN
                         It's on you though, until eight 
                         o'clock tonight when I win my money.

               Sean pulls out his lottery ticket. They start out down the 
               hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               On their backs as they walk down the hall.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, do you have any idea what the 
                         odds are against winning the lottery?

                                     SEAN
                         I don't know... Gotta be at least 
                         four to one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         About thirty million to one.

                                     SEAN
                         You're pretty quick with those 
                         numbers.  How about the odds of me 
                         buying the first round?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         About thirty million to one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BANK OF THE CHARLES RIVER -- AFTERNOON

               Will sits alone, thinking. We hold on him for an extended 
               beat until he gets up and walks away.

               OMITTED

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- EARLY EVENING

               Begin final sequence.

               A wide, establishing shot of Sean's apartment complex as the 
               sun is setting. The lights are on in one unit. A tighter 
               shot reveals Sean, in his apartment, packing his belongings 
               in cardboard boxes.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT, STREET -- SAME

               The camera cranes down from Sean's window and onto the street, 
               where we pan to reveal Will, sitting in his car and looking 
               up at Sean as he packs his things. Will's car is packed full 
               of clothes and books.

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- SAME

               Chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the Cadillac.

               Morgan and Billy ride in the back, leaving the shotgun seat 
               open for Will.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Will holds an envelope which he slips in Sean's mailbox. He 
               puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at Sean in his 
               apartment who is still unaware that Will is there.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie pulls up in front of Will's house. He honks the horn, 
               waits a beat, then gets out and heads toward the house.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Will drives away from Sean's house. Sean hears the car pull 
               out and looks out the window. Sean sees Will's car pulling 
               away.

               Curious, he investigates.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie walks up Will's front steps.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Sean walks out to the sidewalk and looks around. Seeing the 
               mailbox flag has been raised, he walks over to it.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie knocks on Will's front door. There is no answer. He 
               waits a beat, looks in the window. An incredulous smile slowly 
               starts to form.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Sean opens the card Will left for him. It reads:

                                     WILL
                              (in writing)
                         Sean -- If the Professor calls about 
                         that job, just tell him, "Sorry, I 
                         had to go see about a girl."

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the 
               broad smile. He knows Will is gone. He shrugs in explanation 
               to the guys. Morgan takes Will's seat as they pull away from 
               the curb.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               We pan up from the letter to Sean. A broad smile comes over 
               him.

               This is a look we haven't seen. Sean is truly happy.

               EXT. MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE -- SUNSET

               Will is on the road, driving away. As we pull back and credits 
               roll, the car disappears into the horizon.

                                         THE END
"GOOD WILL HUNTING"

               FADE IN:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE -- DAY

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING

               The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is 
               ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across 
               several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last 
               nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh my God, I got the most fucked up 
                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

               As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a 
               table near the back of the bar.

                                     ALL
                         Oh Jesus. Here we go.

               The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest 
               of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer. 
               Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a 
               softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22, 
               heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle 
               with.

               Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other 
               guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror 
               stories with eager disgust.

               All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a 
               rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are 
               its product.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You guys know my cousin Mikey 
                         Sullivan?

                                     ALL
                         Yeah.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well you know how he loves animals 
                         right?  Anyway, last week he's drivin' 
                         home...
                              (laughs)

                                     ALL
                         What? Come on!

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (trying not to laugh)
                         I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, 
                         the fuckin guy loves animals, and 
                         this is the last person you'd want 
                         this to happen to.

                                     WILL
                         Chuckie, what the fuck happened?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Okay. He's driving along and this 
                         fuckin' cat jumps in front of his 
                         car, and so he hits this cat--

               Chuckie is really laughing now.

                                     MORGAN
                         --That isn't funny--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!"
                         And he looks in his rearview and 
                         sees this cat -- I'm sorry--

                                     BILLY
                         Fuckin' Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So he sees this cat tryin to make it 
                         across the street and it's not lookin' 
                         so good.

                                     WILL
                         It's walkin' pretty slow at this 
                         point.

                                     MORGAN
                         You guys are fuckin' sick.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So Mikey's like "Fuck, I gotta put 
                         this thing out of its misery"--So he 
                         gets a hammer--

                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
                         OH!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         out of his tool box, and starts 
                         chasin' the cat and starts whackin' 
                         it with the hammer. You know, tryin' 
                         to put the thing out of its misery.

                                     MORGAN
                         Jesus.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And all the time he's apologizin' to 
                         the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, 
                         "I'm sorry." BANG!

                                     BILLY
                         Like it can understand.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And this Samoan guy comes runnin' 
                         out of his house and he's like "What 
                         the fuck are you doing to my cat?!" 
                         Mikey's like "I'm sorry" --BANG--" I 
                         hit your cat with my truck, and I'm 
                         just trying to put it out of it's 
                         misery" -- BANG! And the cat dies. 
                         So Mikey's like "Why don't you come 
                         look at the front of the truck."
                         'Cause the other guy's all fuckin 
                         flipped out about--

                                     WILL
                         Watching his cat get brained.

               Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, so he's like "Check the front 
                         of my truck, I can prove I hit it 
                         'cause there's probably some blood 
                         or something"--

                                     WILL
                         --or a tail--

                                     MORGAN
                         WILL!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And so they go around to the front 
                         of his truck... and there's another 
                         cat on the grille.

                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
                         No! Ugh!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Is that unbelievable? He brained an 
                         innocent cat!

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               The opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city 
               and the real people who live and work there, going about 
               their daily lives.

               We see a panoramic view of South Boston.

               Will sits in his apartment, walls completely bare. A bed, a 
               small night table and an empty basket adorn the room. A stack 
               of twenty or so LIBRARY BOOKS sit by his bed. He is flipping 
               through a book at about a page a second.

               Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house. His Cadillac 
               idles by the curb. Will comes out and they get in the car.

               We travel across crowded public housing and onto downtown.

               Finally, we gaze across the river and onto the great 
               cementdomed buildings that make up the M.I.T. campus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- DAY

               The classroom is packed with graduate students and TOM.

               PROFESSOR LAMBEAU (52) is at the lectern. The chalkboard 
               behind him is covered with theorems.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Please finish McKinley by next month.

               Many of you probably had this as undergraduates in real 
               analysis. It won't hurt to brush up. I am also putting an 
               advanced fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard--

               Everyone groans.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm hoping that one of you might 
                         prove it by the end of the semester. 
                         The first person to do so will not 
                         only be in my good graces, but go on 
                         to fame and fortune by having their 
                         accomplishment recorded and their 
                         name printed in the auspicious "M.I.T. 
                         Tech."

               Prof. Lambeau holds up a thin publication entitled "M.I.T.  
               Tech." Everyone laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Former winners include Nobel 
                         Laureates, world renowned astro-
                         physicists, Field's Medal winners 
                         and lowly M.I.T.  professors.

               More laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay. That is all.

               A smattering of applause. Students pack their bags.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNLAND  LATER

               The place is a monster indoor funpark. Will, Chuckie, Morgan, 
               and Billy are in adjoining batting cages. Will has disabled 
               the pitching machine in his and pitches to Chuckie. The boys 
               have been drinking. Will throws one to Chuckie, high and 
               tight.

               Several empty beer cans sit by the cage.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Will!

               Another pitch, inside.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're gonna get charged!

                                     WILL
                         You think I'm afraid of you, you big 
                         fuck? You're crowdin' the plate.

               Will guns another one, way inside.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Stop brushin' me back!

                                     WILL
                         Stop crowdin the plate!

               Chuckie laughs and steps back.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. 
                         We should go there sometime.

                                     WILL
                         What are we gonna do up there?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I don't know, we'll fuck up some 
                         smart kids.
                              (stepping back in)
                         You'd prob'ly fit right in.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you.

               Will fires a pitch at Chuckie's head. Chuckie dives to avoid 
               being hit. He gets up and whips his batting helmet at Will.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ROOFTOP -- EARLY AFTERNOON

               SEAN McGUIRE (52) sits, FORMALLY DRESSED, on the roof of his 
               apartment building in a beat-up lawn chair. Well-built and 
               fairly muscular, he stares blankly out over the city.

               On his lap rests an open invitation that reads "M.I.T. CLASS 
               OF '67 REUNION."

               While the morning is quiet and Sean sits serenely, there is 
               a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times. This 
               is a man who fought his way through life. On his lonely stare 
               we:

               EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS LAWN -- DAY

               A thirty year REUNION PARTY has taken over the lawn. A well 
               dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that 
               reads "WELCOME BACK CLASS OF '72." We find Professor Lambeau 
               standing with a drink in his hand, surveying the crowd. He 
               is interrupted by an approaching STUDENT.

                                     STUDENT
                         Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?

                         Yes.

                         Who proved the theorem.

               EXT. TOM FOLEY PARK, S. BOSTON -- AFTERNOON

               In the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys, 
               drinking and smoking cigarettes. Will pops open a beer. The 
               boys have been here a while and it shows.

               Billy sees something that catches his interest.

                                     BILLY
                         Who's that? She's got a nice ass.

               Their P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a 
               beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA)

                                     MORGAN
                         Yah, that is a nice ass.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You could put a pool in that backyard.

                                     BILLY
                         Who's she talking to?

                                     MORGAN
                         That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

                                     WILL
                         Yah, Bobby Champa. He used to beat 
                         the shit outta' me in Kindergarten.

                                     BILLY
                         He's a pretty big kid.

                                     WILL
                         Yah, he's the same size now as he 
                         was in Kindergarten.

                         Fuck this, let's get something to 
                         eat...

                         What Morgan, you're not gonna go 
                         talk to her?

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck her.

               The boys get up and walk down the bleachers.

                         I could go for a Whopper.

                         Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's 
                         Roast Beef" just cause you like the 
                         take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes 
                         out of our way.

                         What else we gonna do we can't spare 
                         fifteen minutes?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell 
                         you why we're not going to "Kelly's." 
                         It's because the take-out bitch is a 
                         fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like 
                         her but she's dumb as a post and she 
                         has never got our order right, never 
                         once.

                                     MORGAN
                         She's not stupid.

                                     WILL
                         She's sharp as a marble.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         We're not goin'.
                              (beat)
                         I don't even like "Kelly's."

               INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- LATER

               Lambeau, still in his reunion formal-wear, strides down the 
               hallway, carrying some papers. A group of students have 
               gathered by the chalkboard. They part like the red sea as he 
               approaches the board. Using the papers in hand, he checks 
               the proof.

               Satisfied, he turns to the class.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is correct? Who did this?

               Dead silence. Lambeau turns to an INDIAN STUDENT.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Nemesh?

               Nemesh shakes his head in awe.

                                     NEMESH
                         No way.

               Lambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, whoever You are, I'm sure you'll 
                         find this one challenging enough to 
                         merit coming forward with your 
                         identity.  That is, if you can do 
                         it.

               INT. CHUCKIE'S CAR, DRIVING IN SOUTH BOSTON -- CONTINUOUS

               The street is crowded as our boys drive down Broadway. They 
               move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down. Chuckie 
               sorts through a large "KELLY'S ROAST BEEF" BAG as he drives.

                                     MORGAN
                         Double Burger.

               Will holds the wheel for Chuckie as he looks through the 
               bag.

                              (same tone)
                         Double Burger.

               Chuckie gets out fries for himself, hands Will his fries.

                                     MORGAN
                         I, I had a Kelly's Double Burger.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Would you shut the fuck up! I know 
                         what you ordered, I was there!

                                     MORGAN
                         So why don't you give me my sandwich?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do you mean "your sandwich?" I 
                         bought it.

                                     MORGAN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Yah, all right...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How much money you got?

                                     MORGAN
                         I told you, I just got change.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well give me your fuckin' change and 
                         we'll put your fuckin' sandwich on 
                         layaway.

                                     MORGAN
                         Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I think you should establish a good 
                         line of credit.

               Laughter, Chuckie goes back searching through the bag.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh motherfucker...

                                     WILL
                         She didn't do it again did she?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Jesus Christ. Not even close.

                                     MORGAN
                         Did she get my Double Burger?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!!
                         IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!

               Chuckie whips a FISH SANDWICH back to Morgan, then to Billy.

                                     WILL
                         Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone 
                         even order a Flyin' Fish?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, and we got four of 'em.

                                     BILLY
                         You gotta' be kiddin' me. Why do we 
                         even go to her?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Cause fuckin' Morgan's got a crush 
                         on her, we always go there and when 
                         we get to the window he never says a 
                         fuckin' word to her, he never even 
                         gets out of the car, and she never 
                         gets our order right cause she's the 
                         goddamn MISSING LINK!

                                     WILL
                         Well, she out did herself today...

                                     MORGAN
                         I don't got a crush on her.

               Push in on Will who sees something O.S.

               Will's P.O.V. reveals BOBBY CHAMPA and his friends walking 
               down the street. One of them casually lobs a bottle into a 
               wire garbage can. It SHATTERS and some of the glass hits a 
               FEMALE PASSERBY who, although unhurt, is upset.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do we got?

                                     WILL
                         I don't know yet.

               Will's P.O.V.: The woman says something to Bobby. He says 
               something back. By the look on her face, it was something 
               unpleasant.

                                     MORGAN
                         Come on, Will...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Shut up.

                                     MORGAN
                         No, why didn't you fight him at the 
                         park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' 
                         now, I'm eatin' my snack.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         So don't go.

               Will is out of the door, jogging toward Bobby Champa. Billy 
               gets out, following Will with a look of casual indifference.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, Let's go.

                                     MORGAN
                         I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.

               Leaving the car, Chuckie opens his door to follow.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (spins in his seat)
                         You're goin'. And if you're not out 
                         there in two fuckin' seconds, when 
                         I'm done with them you're next!

               And with that, Chuckie is out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK --CONTINUOUS

               Will comes jogging up towards BOBBY CHAMPA, calling out from 
               across the street,

                                     WILL
                              (smiling, good 
                              naturedly)
                         Hey, Bobby Champa! I went to 
                         Kindergarten with you right? Sister 
                         Margaret's class...

               Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure 
               of Will's intentions. Just when it looks as though Bobby 
               might remember him, Will DRILLS HIM with a sucker-punch which 
               begins the

               FIGHT SEQUENCE: 40 FRAMES OVER M. GAYE'S "LET'S GET IT ON."

               Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the 
               hapless Champa out cold.

               As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL. 
               Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground. The two 
               exchange messy punches on the sidewalk.

               Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying 
               to avoid being overrun.

               When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he 
               HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.

               Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a 
               shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he 
               was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.

               Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will 
               can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's 
               boys from the hood of a car.

               Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a 
               fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.

               The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown 
               wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone 
               throws a bottle.

               In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's 
               friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will, 
               standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING 
               him.

               ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT

               Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking 
               them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious 
               Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away.

               The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only 
               witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him.

               EXT. SIDEWALK (FULL SPEED) -- CONTINUOUS

               A crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, thanks for comin' out.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, you're all invited over to 
                         Morgan's house for a complementary 
                         fish sandwich.

               The Police slam Will into the hood of a car.

                                     WILL
                              (to Police)
                         Hey, I know it's not a French cruller, 
                         but it's free.

               The cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood, 
               another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car. 
               The look of rage returns to Will's eye.

                                     WILL
                         Get the fuck off me!

               Will resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE 
               KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a 
               fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though 
               he struggles -- takes a beating.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SEAN'S ROOF -- NIGHT

               Sean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is 
               now loose and an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS is at his side. 
               He stares out over the City. A MATRONLY LANDLADY comes out 
               of a doorway on the roof.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Sean?

               Sean doesn't answer.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Sean? You okay?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

               A beat.

                                     LANDLADY
                         It's getting cold.

               After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs. Sean 
               doesn't move.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               EXT. CHARLES RIVER, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

               The morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE -- NEXT MORNING

               Will emerges from the courthouse. Chuckie is waiting for him 
               in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee. 
               He hands one of them to Will. This feels routine.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         When's the arraignment?

                                     WILL
                         Next week.

               Chuckie pulls away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

               Students walk to class, carrying bags. More than any other, 
               students seem to be heading into one PARTICULAR CLASSROOM.

               INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- MORNING

               The classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it. Tom 
               takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited 
               environment with mock pomposity and good humor.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is it my imagination, or has my class 
                         grown considerably?

               Laughter.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I look around and see young people 
                         who are my students, young people 
                         who are not my students as well as 
                         some of my colleagues. And by no 
                         stretch of my imagination do I think 
                         you've all come to hear me lecture.

               More laughter.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         But rather to ascertain the identity 
                         of who our esteemed "The Tech" has 
                         come to call "The Mystery Math 
                         Magician."

               He holds up the M.I.T. Tech featuring a silhouetted figure, 
               emblazoned with a large, white question mark. The headline 
               reads "Mystery Math Magician strikes again."

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Whoever you are, you've solved four 
                         of the most difficult theorems I've 
                         ever given a class. So without further 
                         ado, come forward silent rogue, and 
                         receive thy prize.

               The class waits in breathless anticipation. A STUDENT shifts 
               his weight in his chair, making a noise.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my 
                         spectators, but it appears there 
                         will be no unmasking here today. I'm 
                         going to have to ask those of you 
                         not enrolled in the class to make 
                         your escape now or, for the next 
                         three hours be subjected to the 
                         mundities of eigenvectors.

               People start to gather their things and go. Lambeau picks up 
               a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         However, my colleagues and I have 
                         conferred. There is a problem on the 
                         board, right now, that took us two 
                         years to prove. So let this be said; 
                         the gauntlet has been thrown down. 
                         But the faculty have answered the 
                         challenge and answered with vigor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Lambeau comes out of his office with Tom and locks the door. 
               As he turns to walk down the hallway, he stops. A faint 
               TICKING SOUND can be heard. He turns and walks down the hall.

               Lambeau and Tom come around a corner. His P.O.V. reveals a 
               figure in silhouette blazing through the proof on the 
               chalkboard. There is a mop and a bucket beside him. As Lambeau 
               draws closer, reveal that the figure is Will, in his janitor's 
               uniform. There is a look of intense concentration in his 
               eyes.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me!

               Will looks up, immediately starts to shuffle off.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, I'm sorry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What're you doing?

                                     WILL
                              (walking away)
                         I'm sorry.

               Lambeau follows Will down the hall.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's your name?
                              (beat)
                         Don't you walk away from me. This is 
                         people's work, you can't graffiti 
                         here.

                                     WILL
                         Hey fuck you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (flustered)
                         Well... I'll be speaking to your 
                         supervisor.

               Will walks out. Lambeau goes to "fix" the proof, scanning 
               the blackboard for whatever damage Will caused. He stops, 
               scans the board again. Amazement registers on his face.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         My God.

               Down the hall, we hear the DOOR CLOSE. He turns to look for 
               Will, who is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW AND ARROW PUB, CAMBRIDGE -- THAT NIGHT

               A crowded Harvard Bar. Will and our gang walk by a line of 
               several Harvard students, waiting to be carded.

                                     MORGAN
                         What happened?
                              (beat)
                         You got fired, huh?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.

                                     MORGAN
                              (starts laughing)
                         How fuckin' retarded do you have to 
                         be to get shit-canned from that job? 
                         How hard is it to push a fuckin' 
                         broom?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You got fired from pushing a broom, 
                         you little bitch.

                                     MORGAN
                         Yah, that was different. Management 
                         was restructurin'--

                                     BILLY
                         Yah, restructurin' the amount of 
                         retards they had workin' for them.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck you, you fat fuck.

                                     BILLY
                         Least I work for a livin'.
                              (to Will)
                         Why'd you get fired?

                                     WILL
                         Management was restructurin'.

               Laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         My uncle can probably get you on my 
                         demo team.

                                     MORGAN
                         What the fuck? I just asked you for 
                         a job yesterday!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I told you "no" yesterday!

               After two students flash their ID's to the doorman (CASEY) 
               our boys file past him.

                                     ALL
                              (one after another)
                         What's up Case.

               With an imperceptible nod, Casey waves our boys through. A 
               fifth kid, a HARVARD STUDENT, tries to follow. He is stopped 
               by Casey's massive, outstretched arm:

                                     CASEY
                         ID?

               INT. BOW AND ARROW -- CONTINUOUS

               Chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher, 
               all but Morgan cough up some crumpled dollars.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So, this is a Harvard bar, huh? I 
                         thought there'd be equations and 
                         shit on the wall.

               INT. BACK SECTION, BOW AND ARROW -- MOMENTS LATER

               Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have 
               made themselves comfortable. He [Chuckie] spots two ATTRACTIVE 
               YOUNG HARVARD WOMEN sitting together at the end of the bar.

               Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair. 
               He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston 
               accent.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, how's it goin'?

                                     LYDIA
                         Fine.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So, you ladies ah, go to school here?

                                     LYDIA
                         Yes.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, cause I think I had a class 
                         with you.

               At this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan 
               Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate 
               themselves within listening distance. A rather large student 
               in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie. 
               He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering 
               over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's 
               attention.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What class?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Ah, history I think.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yah, it's not a bad school...

               At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in.

                                     CLARK
                         What class did you say that was?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         History.

                                     CLARK
                         How'd you like that course?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Good, it was all right.

                                     CLARK
                         History? Just "history?" It must 
                         have been a survey course then.

               Chuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy 
               exchange a look and move subtly closer.

                                     CLARK
                         Pretty broad. "History of the World?"

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, come on pal we're in classes 
                         all day. That's one thing about 
                         Harvard never seizes to amaze me, 
                         everybody's talkin' about school all 
                         the time.

                                     CLARK
                         Hey, I'm the last guy to want to 
                         talk about school at the bar. But as 
                         long as you're here I want to "seize" 
                         the opportunity to ask you a question.

               Billy shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan 
               see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again..."

                                     CLARK
                         Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your 
                         history class.

               Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not.

               When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and 
               rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         To tell you the truth, I wasn't there 
                         much. The class was rather elementary.

                                     CLARK
                         Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that 
                         it was. I remember the class, it was 
                         just between recess and lunch.

               Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All right, are we gonna have a 
                         problem?

                                     CLARK
                         There's no problem. I was just hoping 
                         you could give me some insight into 
                         the evolution of the market economy 
                         in the early colonies. My contention 
                         is that prior to the Revolutionary 
                         War the economic modalities especially 
                         of the southern colonies could most 
                         aptly be characterized as agrarian 
                         precapitalist and...

               Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and 
               is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.

                                     WILL
                         Of course that's your contention. 
                         You're a first year grad student. 
                         You just finished some Marxian 
                         historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, 
                         and so naturally that's what you 
                         believe until next month when you 
                         get to James Lemon and get convinced 
                         that Virginia and Pennsylvania were 
                         strongly entrepreneurial and 
                         capitalist back in 1740. That'll 
                         last until sometime in your second 
                         year, then you'll be in here 
                         regurgitating Gordon Wood about the 
                         Pre-revolutionary utopia and the 
                         capital-forming effects of military 
                         mobilization.

                                     CLARK
                              (taken aback)
                         Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, 
                         because Wood drastically 
                         underestimates the impact of--

                                     WILL
                         "Wood drastically underestimates the 
                         impact of social distinctions 
                         predicated upon wealth, especially 
                         inherited wealth..." You got that 
                         from "Work in Essex County," Page 
                         421, right? Do you have any thoughts 
                         of your own on the subject or were 
                         you just gonna plagiarize the whole 
                         book for me?

               Clark is stunned.

                                     WILL
                         Look, don't try to pass yourself off 
                         as some kind of an intellect at the 
                         expense of my friend just to impress 
                         these girls.

               Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit.

                                     WILL
                         The sad thing is, in about 50 years 
                         you might start doin' some thinkin' 
                         on your own and by then you'll realize 
                         there are only two certainties in 
                         life.

                                     CLARK
                         Yeah? What're those?

                                     WILL
                         One, don't do that.  Two -- you 
                         dropped a hundred and fifty grand on 
                         an education you coulda' picked up 
                         for a dollar fifty in late charges 
                         at the Public Library.

               Will catches Skylar's eye.

                                     CLARK
                         But I will have a degree, and you'll 
                         be serving my kids fries at a drive 
                         through on our way to a skiing trip.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         Maybe. But at least I won't be a 
                         prick.
                              (beat)
                         And if you got a problem with that, 
                         I guess we can step outside and deal 
                         with it that way.

               While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] 
               decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.

                                     WILL
                         If you change your mind, I'll be 
                         over by the bar.

               He turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a 
               look.

               Morgan turns to a nearby girl.

                                     MORGAN
                         My boy's wicked smart.

               INT. BOW AND ARROW, AT THE BAR -- LATER

               Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement 
               as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the 
               players shoot miniature balls at a small basket. In the B.G.  
               occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting "Larry!" When he scores.

               Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You suck.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I've been sitting over there for 
                         forty-five minutes waiting for you 
                         to come talk to me. But I'm just 
                         tired now and I have to go home and 
                         I wasn't going to keep sitting there 
                         waiting for you.

                                     WILL
                         I'm Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Skylar. And by the way. That guy 
                         over there is a real dick and I just 
                         wanted you to know he didn't come 
                         with us.

                                     WILL
                         I kind of got that impression.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get 
                         up early and waste some more money 
                         on my overpriced education.

                                     WILL
                         I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Here's my number.

               Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to 
               Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Maybe we could go out for coffee 
                         sometime?

                                     WILL
                         Great, or maybe we could go somewhere 
                         and just eat a bunch of caramels.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         When you think about it, it's just 
                         as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughs)
                         Okay, sounds good.

               She turns.

                                     WILL
                         Five minutes.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         I was trying to be smooth.
                              (indicates clock)
                         But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna 
                         come over there and talk to you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See, it's my life story. Five more 
                         minutes and I would have got to hear 
                         your best pick-up line.

                                     WILL
                         The caramel thing is my pick-up line.

               A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Glad I came over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW AND ARROW -- LATER

               Our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about 
               their bar-ball exploits. Across the street is another bar 
               with a glass front. Morgan spots Clark sitting by the window 
               with some friends.

                                     MORGAN
                         There goes that fuckin' Barney right 
                         now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." 
                         We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

                                     WILL
                         Hold up.

               Will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window 
               and stands across from Clark, separated only by the glass. 
               He POUNDS THE GLASS to get Clark's attention.

                                     WILL
                         Hey!

               Clark turns toward Will.

                                     WILL
                         DO YOU LIKE APPLES?

               Clark doesn't get it.

                                     WILL
                         DO YOU LIKE APPLES?!

                                     CLARK
                         Yeah?

               Will SLAMS SKYLAR'S PHONE NUMBER against the glass.

                                     WILL
                         WELL I GOT HER NUMBER! HOW DO YA 
                         LIKE THEM APPLES?!!

               Will's boys erupt into laughter. Angle on Clark, deflated.

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               The boys make their way home, piled into Chuckie's car, 
               laughing together.

               EXT. CHARLES STREET BRIDGE -- DAWN

               Shot of car crossing over the Charles St. Bridge, overtaking 
               a red-line train.

               EXT. CHARLESTON BACKROAD -- DAWN

               Traveling through narrow back roads in Charlestown, passing 
               the Bunker Hill monument.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. M.I.T. BUILDING AND GROUNDS GARAGE -- DAY

               Lambeau walks into a small garage facility. The area stores 
               lawn machinery and various tools. An older man, TERRY (58) 
               sits behind the desk reading the BOSTON HERALD sports page. 
               Lambeau has obviously never been here before. He takes in 
               the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable. Gets dirty.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me. Is this the buildings and 
                         grounds office?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, can I help you?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm trying to find the name of a 
                         student who works here.

                                     TERRY
                         No students work for me.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Could you just check, because the 
                         young man who works in my building--

                                     TERRY
                         Which one's your building?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Building two.

               Terry checks a list behind his [own] desk. Looks up.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, if something was stolen, I 
                         should know about it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, no. Nothing like that. I just 
                         need his name.

                                     TERRY
                         I can't give you his name unless you 
                         have a complaint.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Please, I'm a professor here and 
                         it's very important.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, he didn't show up for work 
                         today...

               Terry takes a beat. Holding all the cards.

                                     TERRY
                         Look, he got his job through his 
                         P.O. so you can call him.

               Terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk. Takes out a 
               card and hands it to Lambeau. Lambeau looks blankly at the 
               card which reads: "PAROLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM."

               INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

               Will stands before JUDGE MALONE (40) being arraigned. It is 
               fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will 
               and the PROSECUTOR. Lambeau walks in from the back.

                                     WILL
                         There is a lengthy legal precedent, 
                         Your Honor, going back to 1789, 
                         whereby a defendant may claim self-
                         defense against an agent of the 
                         government where the act is shown to 
                         be a defense against tyranny, a 
                         defense of liberty--

               The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who 
                         signed the complaint isn't in my 
                         courtroom. Why is that?

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         He's in the hospital with a broken 
                         knee, Your Honor. But I have 
                         depositions from the other officers.

                                     WILL
                         Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in 
                         his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit 
                         back in 1887, that "Every American 
                         citizen is by birth, a sworn officer 
                         of the state.  Every man is a 
                         policeman." As for the other officers, 
                         even William Congrave said; "he that 
                         first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft 
                         he that has stolen the treasure."

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Your Honor--

               Will cranks it up.

                                     WILL
                              (to Prosecutor)
                         I am afforded the right to speak in 
                         my own defense by our constitution, 
                         Sir.  The same document which 
                         guarantees my right to liberty. 
                         "Liberty," in case you've forgotten, 
                         is "the soul's right to breathe, and 
                         when it cannot take a long breath 
                         laws are girded too tight.  Without 
                         liberty, man is a syncope."
                              (beat, to Judge)
                         Ibid. Your Honor.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Man is a what?

                                     WILL
                         Julius Caesar proclaimed -- Though 
                         he be wounded-- "Magna..."

               The Judge interrupts.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Son,
                              (a beat)
                         My turn.

               The Judge opens Will's CASE HISTORY.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                              (reading)
                         June, '93, assault, Sept. '93 
                         assault... Grand theft auto February 
                         '94.

               A beat, the Judge takes particular notice.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Where, apparently, you defended 
                         yourself and had the case thrown out 
                         by citing "free property rights of 
                         horse and carriage" from 1798...

               Lambeau has to smile, impressed. The Judge shakes his head.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         March, '94 public drunkenness, public 
                         nudity, assault. 10/94 mayhem. 
                         November '94, assault. Jan. '95 
                         impersonating a police officer, 
                         mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned--

               The Judge takes a beat. Gives Will a look.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         You're in my courtroom, now and I am 
                         aware of your priors.
                              (beat)
                         I'm also aware that you're an orphan. 
                         You've been through several foster 
                         homes. The state removed you from 
                         three because of serious physical 
                         abuse.

               The Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Another Judge might care. You hit a 
                         cop, you go in.
                              (beat)
                         Motion to dismiss denied.

               The Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Keep workin' on your arguments, son. 
                         A word of advice for trial; speak 
                         English.

               As Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches 
               Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me, your Honor.
                              (offers hand)
                         Gerald Lambeau.

               An awkward beat. Lambeau waits for some sign of recognition.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm a professor at M.I.T.
                              (beat)
                         Combunatorial Mathematics.

               The Judge offers only a blank look.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Oh. Pleased to meet you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Do you have a minute?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MIDDLESEX COUNTY JAIL, HOLDING AREA -- SAME

               A GUARD walks Will down a hallway toward a group of phones.

                                     GUARD
                         One call, to an attorney.
                              (beat)
                         One.

               The Guard gives Will a hard look for a beat. Then leaves.

                                     WILL
                         How many?

               Will picks up the phone, dials.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, Skylar?

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah?

                                     WILL
                         It's Will, the really funny good 
                         looking guy you met at the bar?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting 
                         anyone who fits that description.

                                     WILL
                         Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, 
                         obnoxious, toothless loser who got 
                         drunk and wouldn't leave you alone 
                         all night.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd 
                         call.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this 
                         week we could go to a cafe and have 
                         some caramels.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Sounds good, where are you now?

                                     WILL
                         You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? 
                         Are you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MIDDLESEX COUNTY JAIL, INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER

               Professor Lambeau sits, waiting. Will is brought in, shackled, 
               by the guard.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck do you want?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I've spoken with the judge and he's 
                         agreed to release you under my 
                         supervision.

                                     WILL
                              (suspicious)
                         Really?

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (beat)
                         Yes. Under two conditions.

                                     WILL
                         What're those?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That you meet with me twice a week
                              (a beat)
                         and you meet with a therapist.

                                     WILL
                         If I agree to this, I walk right 
                         now?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right.

                                     WILL
                         I'll do the work. I'm not going to 
                         meet with a therapist.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, 
                         Will.
                              (beat)
                         I've already spoken to one therapist, 
                         his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a 
                         friend of mine. He's also published 
                         four books and is widely considered 
                         to be one of the brightest men in 
                         his field.
                              (beat)
                         I'm sure it'll be better than spending 
                         the next six months in jail.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNLAND -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie walk up to an enclosed trampoline. Billy 
               and Morgan prefer to use it for their own version of 
               "Wrestlemania."

               As Will and Chuckie approach, Billy is on top of a bloodied 
               Morgan and has him in the "Cobra Clutch."  Will and Chuckie 
               watch for a beat. Billy tightens his grip.

                                     BILLY
                         Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!

                                     MORGAN
                              (being strangled)
                         Suck my cock!

                                     BILLY
                         Oh, Morgan!

               Chuckie turns to Will, conspiratorially as they wait for the 
               fight to finish.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What'd you get? You get leniency?

                                     WILL
                         Probation, counselin', few days a 
                         week.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're fuckin' good.

               Will smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Just submit, Morgan. He's got you in 
                         the Cobra Clutch.

                                     MORGAN
                              (to Chuckie)
                         Fuck your mother too!

               INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading. A closer 
               look reveals he is reading a self-help PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. Will 
               is flipping through the book at about a page per second. He 
               shakes his head and smiles. Upon finishing the book, he throws 
               it in a nearby WASTEBASKET. Push in on the back of the book 
               where a SMILING PSYCHOLOGIST is pictured.

               INT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

               Will sits in a well decorated Psychologist's Office. Across 
               from Will sits the same PSYCHOLOGIST, HENRY LIPKIN (40), 
               from the book. They are in mid-session.

                                     WILL
                         That's why I love stock-car racin'. 
                         That Dale Ernhart's real good.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Now you know Will, and I know, what 
                         you need to be doing. You have a 
                         gift.

                                     WILL
                         I could work the pit maybe, but I 
                         could never drive like Dale Ernhart--

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         You have a quality -- something you 
                         were born with, that you have no 
                         control over -- and you are, in a 
                         sense, hiding that by becoming a 
                         janitor. And I'm not saying that's 
                         wrong. I'm friends with the janitor 
                         that works in my building.  He's 
                         been to my house for dinner. As a 
                         matter of fact I did some free 
                         consultation for "Mike" -- that's 
                         not his real name. That's in my book.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had 
                         the same problems as "Chad" the 
                         stockbroker.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Yes. The pressures you feel, and 
                         again, I am neither labeling nor 
                         judging them, are keeping you from 
                         fulfilling your potential -- you're 
                         in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- 
                         the Shenanigan's, Will.

                                     WILL
                         You're right. I know.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Will, your not getting off that easy.

                                     WILL
                         No, but, I mean you know... I do 
                         other things. That no one knows about.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Like what, Will?

                                     WILL
                         I go places, I interact.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         What places?

                                     WILL
                         Certain, clubs.
                              (beat)
                         Like, Paradise. It's not bad.

               Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look.

                                     WILL
                         It's just that feeling when you can 
                         take your shirt off and really dance.
                              (beat)
                         When the music owns you. Do you 
                         understand?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         I might understand that.

                                     WILL
                         Do you find it hard to hide the fact 
                         that you're gay?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, I read your book. I talked to 
                         you. It's just something I know to 
                         be true.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         That's very presumptuous.

                                     WILL
                         Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready 
                         to give me a jump.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                              (a little laugh)
                         Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, 
                         but I'm married and I have two 
                         children.

                                     WILL
                         I'm sure you do. You probably got a 
                         real nice house, nice car -- your 
                         book's a best seller.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         You're getting defensive, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Look, man. I don't care if you're 
                         putting from the rough. There are 
                         solid arguments that some of the 
                         greatest people in history were gay; 
                         Alexander the Great, Caesar, 
                         Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, 
                         Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny 
                         Terrio, not many straight men can 
                         dance like that.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Who is "Danny Terrio?"

                                     WILL
                         If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your 
                         shot. Take some pride in it. You go 
                         to church? So fuckin' what, God loves 
                         you.  I mean, Christ. A guy as well 
                         known as you? By the time you put 
                         your disguise on and skulk out of 
                         the house Sunday nights you probably 
                         look like "Inspector Clouseau."

               The Psychologist calmly packs his things.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Well, I can see this is pointless...

                                     WILL
                         You're getting defensive... Henry. 
                         And hey, chief -- tell the wife, at 
                         least.  Christ, set her free.

               The shrink gets up and walks out.

                                     WILL
                         Fuckin' hypocrite...

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               The Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of 
               Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Henry?

               The Psychologist keeps walking.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         No. You know what, Gerry? This is 
                         why I don't do pro-bono anymore. 
                         It's not worth it to me.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What happened?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         I don't have the time. I'm going on 
                         national television this week.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Wait a minute, Henry...

               He [Henry] is out the door. Lambeau looks to Tom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will is in Lambeau's office. Lambeau is at the board, working 
               on a diagram as Tom takes notes. Will seems disinterested.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This rectangle is subdivided into 
                         rectangles. One edge of an inner 
                         rectangle is an integer. Can you 
                         prove that one edge of the larger 
                         rectangle is an integer?

                                     WILL
                         Of course.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay. How?

                                     WILL
                         It's an integer proof.

               Lambeau smiles.

                                     WILL
                         What? Hey, look buddy my time's almost 
                         up. You want me to sit here for an 
                         hour and write it out?

               Lambeau says nothing. Will gets up and goes to the board.

                                     WILL
                         Look, I'll give you the key steps to 
                         it but I'm not gonna do the whole 
                         thing.

               Lambeau keeps smiling.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That would be a monumental waste of 
                         time, wouldn't it, Will?

                                     WILL
                         I think so.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I happen to know so.

               Lambeau rises and goes to the board.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're thinking too hard. What if I 
                         did this?

               He draws a vertical line through the diagram.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now, what if I do this?

               He draws a horizontal line through the diagram. He hands 
               Will the chalk.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you ever played checkers?

               Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at. In a flash he starts 
               drawing lines through the diagram, energized.

                                     WILL
                         You color-code it. Half-red, half-
                         black.  If that's an integer--

               Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will].

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's that?

                                     WILL
                         Half-red, half-black--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --that?--

                                     WILL
                         --Half-red, half-black--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --That edge!

                                     WILL
                         An integer.

               The two stop. They are silent for a moment. Like two 
               gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (checks his watch)
                         It would appear we got that proof in 
                         under the wire after all. It's not 
                         how hard you look at things, young 
                         man, it's the way you look at them. 
                         If you take aim before you fire, you 
                         will find the most difficult problems 
                         become, quite literally, child's 
                         play.

               Will gets his coat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, you've managed to offend four 
                         of my colleagues so much that they 
                         refused to come back. You're meeting 
                         with the leading hypnotist in the 
                         country next week and Tom and I plan 
                         to sit in on the sessions, so I expect 
                         you to behave appropriately.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits in a chair across from Lambeau and the HYPNOTIST.

               Lambeau's assistant, TOM (33) takes notes. The Hypnotist 
               makes small talk with Lambeau, who checks his watch.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Shall we start the, uh...

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You 
                         guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Yes, Will. We'll get to that. But 
                         first, why don't you go to sleep for 
                         me.

               He SNAPS HIS FINGERS and instantly Will's head goes BACK and 
               his EYES CLOSE. The Hypnotist gives Lambeau a look.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Would you mind standing on one leg?

               Will gets up and stands on one leg. Lambeau is impressed.

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- LATER

               Will is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state. The 
               mood is more serious now.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now 
                         how old are you?

                                     WILL
                         Seven.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         And what do you see?

                                     WILL
                         Somethin's in my room.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         What is it?

                                     WILL
                         It's like a small figure, hoverin' 
                         over me. Gettin' closer.

               Will flinches.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         You're in a safe place, Will.

                                     WILL
                         It's touching me.

               Lambeau makes a sound. The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau] 
               with his [Hypnotist's] finger. Tom returns to his note-taking.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Where is it touching you?

                                     WILL
                         Down there.
                              (indicating genitals)
                         And I'm nervous.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         You don't have to be nervous, Will.

               Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks. This is working.

                                     WILL
                         'Cause I'm not ready.
                              (calming)
                         But the figure tells me everything's 
                         gonna be all right. 'Cause the 
                         figure's a Libra too. And we start 
                         dancin' and it's beautiful--

               Will breaks into song at full volume.

                                     WILL
                         "SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!"

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (getting up)
                         Oh Jesus.

               The Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door. 
               Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets."

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Wait a minute, Barry.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         I have better ways to spend my time.

               He is gone. Will stops singing, laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, for God's sake, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this 
                         one on me. He left, I wanted to talk 
                         to him for another twenty minutes. I 
                         was havin' fun.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I told you to cooperate with these 
                         people.

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece 
                         of work.

               Will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of 
               Lambeau.

                                     WILL
                              (spooky voice)
                         Look into my eyes. I don't need 
                         therapy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Get out, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Okay... don't forget to get another 
                         therapist for next week.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's enough.

               Will is out the door. Lambeau turns to Tom.

                                     TOM
                         I called Mel Weintraub this morning, 
                         to check for availability.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's the point?

                                     TOM

                         There is somebody...

                                     TOM
                         Who is he?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He was my roommate in college.

               INT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- DAY

               This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class. 
               Emblazoned on the door is "room 101." While the lecture hall 
               could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here 
               today.

               Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired 
               of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the 
               tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student 
               body.

                                     SEAN
                         Establishing trust is the most 
                         important component in making 
                         breakthroughs with a patient. Why?

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         Maureen?

               MAUREEN'S only response is an empty stare.

                                     SEAN
                         Keep up the good work, Maureen. 
                         Vinnie?

               VINNIE looks up.

                                     VINNIE
                         Because trust is an important thing.

                                     SEAN
                         Don't bullshit me, Vinnie. Didn't 
                         your brother give you the notes? 
                         Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you 
                         then they won't feel safe enough to 
                         be honest with you -- then there's 
                         no point to them being in therapy. 
                         It's like saying -- "Fine, come here 
                         and don't tell me a thing but go 
                         home feeling like you're doing 
                         something about your problems -- and 
                         give me my fifty bucks before you 
                         leave will ya'!"

               He looks around the room for approval. No one is listening.

                                     SEAN
                         If you don't help them trust you -- 
                         then there's no way you'll ever get 
                         them to sleep with you. And that 
                         should be the goal of any good 
                         therapist. Insecure women, you know... 
                         nail 'em when they're vulnerable, 
                         that's always been my motto.

               The students look up, somewhat stunned.

                                     SEAN
                         See, I got Vinnie's attention.

               Laughter. Sean starts to resume his lecture, when he notices 
               LAMBEAU standing in the back of the room. There is an awkward 
               moment.

                                     SEAN

                         Well, it seems we're in the presence 
                         of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau 
                         is a Field's Medal winner. 
                         Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.

               The students stare blankly.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello.

                                     SEAN

                         But it's only given out every four 
                         years.

                         get through Fernald by Monday.

               The class starts to pack up and file out. Lambeau approaches 
               Sean who steps down from the lectern.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Good to see you.

                         Is there someplace we can talk?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar on their first date. They watch a street 
               MAGICIAN doing tricks with a rabbit. The guy's tricks are 
               pretty good, but his on-stage persona could use some work. 
               He is incessantly repeating the phrase "this is the rabbit, 
               the rabbit really does the tricks." Will gives Skylar a look 
               and they move on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOY STORE -- LATER

               Will and Skylar walk into the small shop.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't know, it was just kind of 
                         the boring suburban thing. Private 
                         school, Harvard, and now Med. School.

                         I actually figured out that at the 
                         end of it, my brain will be worth a 
                         quarter of a million dollars. I 
                         shouldn't have told you that...

                                     WILL
                         I bet your parents were happy to 
                         pay.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I was happy to pay. I inherited the 
                         money.

                                     WILL
                         Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Stanford. I'm leaving in June after 
                         I graduate.

                                     WILL
                         So you just want to use me and go?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, I'm gonna experiment on you 
                         for my anatomy class, then go.

                                     WILL
                         In that case, fine.
                              (beat)
                         Want to see my magic trick?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Sure.

               Will, pulls out a bulging HANDFUL OF CARAMELS.

                                     WILL
                         Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels 
                         disappear.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay...

               Will goes into all manner of hocus-pocus theatrics. Then 
               shakes his hand wildly. The trick doesn't pan out and the 
               caramels go flying all over the store. Skylar laughs.

                                     WILL
                         It works better when I have my rabbit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

               Lambeau and Sean share a table at this exclusive restaurant.

               Sean seems slightly out of place in his wrinkled sport coat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I didn't see you at the reunion.

                         Well, there's this part of the movie 
                         that's about how there's always this 
                         tension on a first date where both 
                         people are thinking about what's 
                         going to happen with the whole 'good 
                         night kiss' thing.

               Will smiles.

                                     WILL
                         I really don't 'date' that much.

                                     SKYLAR

                         at least thought about it.

                         Yes you have. You were thinking you 
                         were gonna get a good night kiss.

               She laughs.

                         No... I was hoping to get a kiss.

                         Then why don't we just get it out of 
                         the way.

               He looks at her.

                                     WILL
                         Now?

               Both of them have cheeseburger in their mouths.

                         Yeah.

               They kiss, mouths full of burger. It's nice. A beat.

                         That had to be the worst good night 
                         kiss...

               Will laughs.

               She laughs.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He was alive over a hundred years 
                         ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not 
                         feathers...

               Sean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny 
                         hut in India. No formal education, 
                         no access to other works. But he 
                         came across an old math book and 
                         from this basic text he was able to 
                         extrapolate theories that had baffled 
                         mathematicians for years.

                                     SEAN
                         And he mailed it to Hardy--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right, Sean. He mailed it to 
                         a professor at Cambridge who 
                         immediately recognized the brilliance 
                         in his work and brought Ramanujan to 
                         England.

                                     SEAN
                         Where he contracted pneumonia and 
                         died at a young age--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         They worked together for the remainder 
                         of their lives, producing some of 
                         the most exciting math theory ever 
                         done.  Ramanujan's genius was 
                         unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like 
                         that. But he's very defensive and I 
                         need someone who can get through to 
                         him.

                                     SEAN
                         Why me?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I need someone with your kind of 
                         background.

                                     SEAN
                         My kind of background?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're from the same neighborhood. 
                         South Boston.

                                     SEAN
                         He's from Southie? How many people 
                         did you try before you came to me?

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (looks squarely at 
                              Sean)
                         Five.

               Sean gives a slight, knowing smile.

                                     SEAN
                         Who? Barry, Henry, Rick...

               Lambeau nods.

                                     SEAN
                         Not Rick? You didn't send him to 
                         Rick?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Just meet with the boy once a week.

                                     SEAN
                         Can we do it at my office?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That would be fine.

               The waiter comes with the CHECK. Each man reaches for it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, please.

                                     SEAN
                         I got it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's on the college.

               Sean relents.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- MORNING

               Establishing shot of the red-brick campus. Planes land at 
               nearby Logan airport. Will walks up the steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean's office is comfortable. Books are stacked against the 
               wall. There is a PAINTING on the wall behind Sean. Sean is 
               seated behind a desk. Lambeau sits in a chair in the back of 
               the room, next to Tom. A long beat passes, they wait.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Any vulnerability he senses, he'll 
                         exploit.

                                     SEAN
                         I'll be okay.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's a poker game with this young 
                         man.  Don't let him see what you've 
                         got.

               Sean nods. Will walks in. Everyone stands to greet Will.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello, Will. Any trouble finding the 
                         place?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, 
                         Will Hunting.

               Sean and Will nod. An awkward moment as the four men stand.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, let's get started.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, let's let the healing begin.

               Lambeau is slightly embarrassed. Sean smiles at Will's joke.

                                     SEAN
                         Would you excuse us?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Tom.

                                     SEAN
                         You too, Gerry.

               Lambeau looks at Sean, surprised. Sean's stare is unwavering.

               After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will 
               alone. Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second. He 
               seems more interested in the room. There is a long silence 
               as Sean watches Will.

                                     SEAN
                         Hello, Will. I'm Sean Maguire.

               A smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and 
               sits.

               He lights a cigarette. Sean continues to watch him. Finally-

                                     SEAN
                         Where are you from in Southie?

                                     WILL
                         Did you buy all these books retail, 
                         or do you send away for like a "shrink 
                         kit" that comes with all these volumes 
                         included?

                                     SEAN
                         Have you read all these books, Will?

                                     WILL
                         Probably not.

                                     SEAN
                              (indicating a shelf)
                         How about the ones on that shelf?

               Will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I read those.

                                     SEAN
                         What did you think?

                                     WILL
                         I'm not here for a fuckin' book 
                         report.  They're your books, why 
                         don't you read 'em?

                                     SEAN
                         I did.

                                     WILL
                         That must have taken you a long time.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah, it did take me a long time.

               Sean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident 
               manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair 
               and goes to the shelf.

                                     WILL
                              (looking at book)
                         "A History of the United States, 
                         Volume I." If you want to read a 
                         real history book, read Howard Zinn's 
                         "A People's History of the United 
                         States." That book will knock you on 
                         your ass.

                                     SEAN
                         How about Noam Chomsky's 
                         "Manufacturing Consent?"

                                     WILL
                         You people baffle me. You spend all 
                         this money on beautiful, fancy books-- 
                         and they're the wrong fuckin' books.

                                     SEAN
                         You think so?

                                     WILL
                         Whatever blows your hair back.

               Will returns to his chair. Pause.

                                     SEAN
                              (indicating cigarette)
                         Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much.
                         Stunt your growth.

                                     WILL
                         You're right. It really gets in the 
                         way of my jazzercizing.

               Sean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He 
               remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his 
               face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence.

                                     WILL
                         Do you lift?

                                     SEAN
                         Yes, I do.

                                     WILL
                         Nautilus?

                                     SEAN
                         Free weights.

                                     WILL
                         Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?

                                     SEAN
                         285. 

                                     WILL
                         Oh.

               Will gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's 
               painting. It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous 
               storm -- by no means a masterpiece. Will studies it.

                                     WILL
                         You paint this?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah. Do you paint?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         Crayons?

                                     WILL
                         This is a real piece of shit.

                                     SEAN
                         Tell me what you really think.

                                     WILL
                         Poor color composition, lousy use of 
                         space. But that shit doesn't really 
                         concern me.

                                     SEAN
                         What does?

                                     WILL
                         The color here, see how dark it is? 
                         It's interesting.

                                     SEAN
                         What is?

                                     WILL
                         I think you're one step away from 
                         cutting your ear off.

                                     SEAN
                         Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?

                                     WILL
                         You ever heard the saying, "any port 
                         in a storm?"

                         Sure, how 'bout "still waters run 
                         deep"-

                                     WILL
                         --Well, maybe that means you.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe what mea--

                                     WILL
                         Maybe you were in the middle of a 
                         storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the 
                         waves were crashing over the bow, 
                         the Goddamned mast was about to snap, 
                         and you were crying for the harbor. 
                         So you did what you had to do, to 
                         get out.  Maybe you became a 
                         psychologist.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe you should be a patient and 
                         sit down.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe you married the wrong woman.

                                     SEAN
                         Watch your mouth.

                                     WILL
                         That's it isn't it? You married the 
                         wrong woman. She leave you? Was she 
                         bangin' someone else?

               Sean is walking slowly towards Will.

                                     WILL
                         How are the seas now, D--

               In a flash, Sean has Will by the throat. Will is helpless.

                                     SEAN
                         If you ever disrespect my wife 
                         again... I will end you.

                                     WILL
                         Time's up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               Will walks out of Sean's office past Lambeau and Tom who are 
               sitting in the hallway.

                                     WILL
                         At ease, gentlemen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean stands behind his desk in his office, still very much 
               on edge. Lambeau walks in.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Five minutes, Sean. Are you okay?

               A pause, Sean is staring at his painting.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll understand if you don't want to 
                         meet with him again.

                         Thursday, four o'clock. Make sure 
                         the kid is here.

               EXT. WONDERLAND RACETRACK -- DAY

               Will and Skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run. 
               They ad lib teasing one another about England, Ireland, and 
               America.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You grew up around here?

                                     WILL
                         Not far from here, South Boston.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How was that?

                                     WILL
                         Pretty boring, I guess.

               She smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I bet you have a great family.

                                     WILL
                         You know, nothing special.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You have a lot of brothers and 
                         sisters?

                                     WILL
                         Do I have a lot of brothers and 
                         sisters?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah.

                                     WILL
                         Well, Irish Catholic. What do you 
                         think?

                                     SKYLAR
                         How many?

                                     WILL
                         You wouldn't believe me if I told 
                         you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What, five?

               Will shakes his head.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Seven?

               Will shakes his head. Smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come on.

                                     WILL
                         I have twelve big brothers.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Not a chance.

                                     WILL
                         Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Bullshit.

                                     WILL
                         I swear to God.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Your house must have been a zoo.

                                     WILL
                         It was great. There was always someone 
                         to play with, give you advice.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Do you know all their names?

                                     WILL
                         'Course I do, they're my brothers.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well...

                                     WILL
                         Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, 
                         Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, 
                         Johnny, and Brian.

                              (laughing)
                         Do you keep in touch with them?

                                     WILL
                         All the time. We all live in Southie. 
                         I live with three of them now.

               Skylar smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I want to meet them.

                                     WILL
                         We'll do that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               As we pan across Sean's small apartment, we find it strewn 
               with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes. Although, if 
               it weren't for the clutter, the place would feel pretty bare. 
               A framed SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover featuring a screaming Larry 
               Bird and entitled "CELTIC PRIDE" hangs on the wall. Sean 
               sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of 
               BUSHMILL'S IRISH WHISKEY. He is deep in thought.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will strolls into the office. Sean is waiting there behind 
               his desk. He seems different. More calm. Will and Sean stare 
               at each other for a long moment.

                                     WILL
                         You again. How the paintin' coming?

               Sean stands up.

                                     SEAN
                         Come with me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOSTON COMMON -- MINUTES LATER

               Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park.

               They look out over a small pond, in which a group of 
               schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats.

                                     WILL
                         So what's with this place? You have 
                         a swan fetish? Is this something 
                         you'd like to talk about?

                                     SEAN
                         I was thinking about what you said 
                         to me the other day, about my 
                         painting. I stayed up half the night 
                         thinking about it and then something 
                         occurred to me and I fell into a 
                         deep peaceful sleep and haven't 
                         thought about you since. You know 
                         what occurred to me?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         You're just a boy. You don't have 
                         the faintest idea what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     WILL
                         Why thank you.

                                     SEAN
                         You've never been out of Boston.

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         So if I asked you about art you could 
                         give me the skinny on every art book 
                         ever written... Michelangelo? You 
                         know a lot about him I bet. Life's 
                         work, criticisms, political 
                         aspirations. But you couldn't tell 
                         me what it smells like in the Sistine 
                         Chapel. You've never stood there and 
                         looked up at that beautiful ceiling. 
                         And if I asked you about women I'm 
                         sure you could give me a syllabus of 
                         your personal favorites, and maybe 
                         you've been laid a few times too.
                         But you couldn't tell me how it feels 
                         to wake up next to a woman and be 
                         truly happy. If I asked you about 
                         war you could refer me to a bevy of 
                         fictional and non-fictional material, 
                         but you've never been in one. You've 
                         never held your best friend's head 
                         in your lap and watched him draw his 
                         last breath, looking to you for help. 
                         And if I asked you about love I'd 
                         get a sonnet, but you've never looked 
                         at a woman and been truly vulnerable. 
                         Known that someone could kill you 
                         with a look. That someone could rescue 
                         you from grief. That God had put an 
                         angel on Earth just for you.  And 
                         you wouldn't know how it felt to be 
                         her angel. To have the love be there 
                         for her forever. Through anything, 
                         through cancer. You wouldn't know 
                         about sleeping sitting up in a 
                         hospital room for two months holding 
                         her hand and not leaving because the 
                         doctors could see in your eyes that 
                         the term "visiting hours" didn't 
                         apply to you. And you wouldn't know 
                         about real loss, because that only 
                         occurs when you lose something you 
                         love more than yourself, and you've 
                         never dared to love anything that 
                         much. I look at you and I don't see 
                         an intelligent confident man, I don't 
                         see a peer, and I don't see my equal. 
                         I see a boy. Nobody could possibly 
                         understand you, right Will? Yet you 
                         presume to know so much about me 
                         because of a painting you saw.  You 
                         must know everything about me.  You're 
                         an orphan, right?

               Will nods quietly.

                                     SEAN
                         Do you think I would presume to know 
                         the first thing about who you are 
                         because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I 
                         don't buy the argument that you don't 
                         want to be here, because I think you 
                         like all the attention you're getting. 
                         Personally, I don't care. There's 
                         nothing you can tell me that I can't 
                         read somewhere else.  Unless we talk 
                         about your life. But you won't do 
                         that. Maybe you're afraid of what 
                         you might say.

               Sean stands,

                                     SEAN
                         It's up to you.

               And walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie doing demo at the site. They throw 
               cinderblocks out a window into a pile. They are filthy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- NIGHT

               Rain pounds South Boston. Chuckie sits with the Cadillac 
               fiddling, humming to the radio. Morgan and Billy sit in the 
               back, sharing a case of beer. Will is at a pay phone.

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     SKYLAR
                         Hello?

               Will hangs up and runs back to the car, soaked.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Who'd you call?

                                     WILL
                         No one. I didn't have the number.

                                     MORGAN
                         What are you, retarded? You went all 
                         the way out there in the rain and 
                         you didn't have the number?

                                     WILL
                         No, it was your mother's 900 number. 
                         I just ran out of quarters.

               Laughter. Chuckie pulls away from the curb.

                                     MORGAN
                         Why don't we get off mothers, I just 
                         got off yours.

               There is a long moment of silence in response to Morgan's 
               attempt at levity. Then laughter.

                                     BILLY
                         You're a pretty funny guy. Here, 
                         have a nickel.

               Billy WHIPS his EMPTY BEER CAN off of Morgan's head.

                                     MORGAN
                         Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what 
                         happens.

                                     BILLY
                         All right, then.

                                     MORGAN
                         Watch what happens.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from Sean completely silent and takes out a 
               pack of cigarettes.

                                     SEAN
                         No smoking.

               Will puts the cigarettes away. Sean stares at Will and 
               occasionally at the clock. Sean continues to check the clock 
               on the wall. It is the only clock in the room and it is BEHIND 
               Will. Their hour is almost up.

               CLOSE ON: WILL'S EYES INTERCUT WITH THE CLOCK.

               He is counting seconds. As the second hand crosses the twelve, 
               Will stands up and walks out, leaving Sean alone.

               INT. HALLWAY -- LATER

               Lambeau and Sean walk down the hallway after the session.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What do you mean "he didn't talk?" 
                         You sat there for an hour?

                                     SEAN
                         No, he just sat there and counted 
                         the seconds until the session was 
                         over. It was pretty impressive, 
                         actually.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Why would he do that?

                                     SEAN
                         To show me he doesn't have to talk 
                         to me if he doesn't want to.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring 
                         contest between two kids from the 
                         "old neighborhood?"

                                     SEAN
                         I won't talk first.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- EVENING

               Chuckie drops Will off at his apartment, watches him [Will] 
               walk up the steps.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               Chuckie pulls up to the curb and walks up the steps to Will's 
               front door. After a beat, Will emerges. They get back in 
               [the car].

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie at work. Chuckie shows Will how to be a 
               man.

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- NIGHT

               The bar is a bit more crowded than usual. Will and Chuckie 
               walk back to their table, carrying beers. They pass a table 
               of GIRLS, local regulars getting just as bombed as the guys. 
               These girls are a little overdone. Too much make-up, too 
               much hairspray, and too much body for such tight outfits. 
               One of the girls, KRYSTYN, smiles at Will who seems subdued.

                                     KRYSTYN
                         Hi, Will.

                                     WILL
                         How you doin', Krystyn.

               They pass the table of girls. Chuckie looks at one, ruefully.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I didn't get on Cathy last night.

                                     WILL
                         Why not?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I don't know.

               Chuckie turns back to one of the girls, calling out:

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Cathy! Why didn't you give me none 
                         of your twat last night?

               A girl at the table, CATHY, holds up her PINKY FINGER and 
               smiles -- revealing a mouthful of MISSING TEETH.

                                     CATHY
                         Fuck you and your Irish curse, 
                         Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         She's missin' teeth, Will.

               Will nods, not really into it tonight.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Plus, it's like, five to two Morgan 
                         ends up marryin' her. There's only 
                         so many times you can bang your 
                         friend's future wife...

               They get to the table. Will's heart just isn't in it.

                                     WILL
                         I'm takin' off.

                                     ALL
                         We're goin' late night.

                                     WILL
                         I'm tired.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will and Lambeau work together at the board. They communicate 
               non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem. After a 
               particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look 
               and laugh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will and Sean sit in silence. A long moment passes. Sean 
               casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. Will restlessly 
               looks around the room and then back to Sean. An odd half 
               smile crosses Sean's face. After a moment:

                                     WILL
                         You know, I was on this plane once. 
                         And I'm sittin' there and the captain 
                         comes on and is like "we'll be 
                         cruising at 35,000 feet," and does 
                         his thing, then he puts the mike 
                         down but forgets to turn it off. 
                         Then he says "man, all I want right 
                         now is a blow-job and a cup of 
                         coffee."  So the stewardess goes 
                         runnin' up towards the cock-pit to 
                         tell him the mike's still on, and 
                         this guy in the back of the plane 
                         goes "don't forget the coffee!"

                                     SEAN
                              (smiles)
                         You've never been on a plane.

                                     WILL
                         I know, but the joke's better if I 
                         tell it in the first person.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         I have been laid you know.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah? You got a lady now?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I went on a date last week.

                                     SEAN
                         How'd it go?

                                     WILL
                         Fine.

                                     SEAN
                         Well, are you going out again?

                                     WILL
                         I don't know.

                                     SEAN
                         Why not?

                                     WILL
                         Haven't called her.

                                     SEAN
                         Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.

                                     WILL
                         I know what I'm doing. She's different 
                         from the other girls I met. We have 
                         a really good time. She's smart, 
                         beautiful, fun...

                                     SEAN
                         So Christ, call her up.

                                     WILL
                         Why? So I can realize she's not so 
                         smart. That she's boring. You don't 
                         get it. Right now she's perfect, I 
                         don't want to ruin that.

                                     SEAN
                         And right now you're perfect too. 
                         Maybe you don't want to ruin that.

               Will says nothing.

                                     SEAN
                         Well, I think that's a great 
                         philosophy Will, that way you can go 
                         through your entire life without 
                         ever having to really know anybody.

               Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife used to turn the alarm clock 
                         off in her sleep. I was late for 
                         work all the time because in the 
                         middle of the night she'd roll over 
                         and turn the damn thing off. 
                         Eventually I got a second clock and 
                         put it under my side of the bed, but 
                         it got to where she was gettin' to 
                         that one too. She was afraid of the 
                         dark, so the closet light was on all 
                         night. Thing kept me up half the 
                         night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep, 
                         out of sheer exhaustion and not wake 
                         up when I was supposed to cause she'd 
                         have already gotten to my alarms.

               Will smiles, Sean takes a beat.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's been dead two years, Will. 
                         And when I think about her, those 
                         are the things I think about most. 
                         Little idiosyncrasies that only I 
                         knew about.  Those made her my wife. 
                         And she had the goods on me too. 
                         Little things I do out of habit. 
                         People call these things imperfections 
                         Will. It's just who we are. And we 
                         get to choose who we're going to let 
                         into out weird little worlds. You're 
                         not perfect. And let me save you the 
                         suspense, this girl you met isn't 
                         either. The question is, whether or 
                         not you're perfect for each other.  
                         You can know everything in the world, 
                         but the only way you're findin' that 
                         one out is by giving it a shot. You 
                         sure won't get the answer from an 
                         old fucker like me. And even if I 
                         did know, I wouldn't tell you.

               Will smiles. A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Why not? You told me every other 
                         fuckin' thing. You talk more than 
                         any shrink I ever met.

               Sean laughs.

                                     SEAN
                         I teach this shit, I didn't say I 
                         knew how to do it.

                                     WILL
                         You ever think about gettin' 
                         remarried?

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's dead.

                                     WILL
                         Hence, the word remarried.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's dead.

                                     WILL
                         Well I think that's a wonderful 
                         philosophy, Sean. That way you can 
                         go through the rest of your life 
                         without having to really know anyone.

               A beat. Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Time's up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

               Will is waiting outside the door for someone to come out -- 
               so he can go in.

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

               The door to Skylar's dorm is partially open. Will stands 
               outside while Skylar remains on the threshold.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Where have you been?

                                     WILL
                         I'm sorry, I been real busy.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You were busy? You know, I really 
                         was waiting for you to call me.

                                     WILL
                         Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another 
                         crack at it. Let me take you out.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You should have called. I have an "O-
                         chem" lab due tomorrow and it's 
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         It's not an excuse dummy. I want to 
                         go out with you. But look:

               She holds up her Lab. Will glances at it.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Tomorrow?

                                     WILL
                         Promise?

                                     SKYLAR
                         If you bring the caramels.

               Will smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- LATER

               Will sits in an outdoor cafe, thinking. After a beat, he 
               leans over to two students working at a nearby table, borrows 
               a pen and paper and starts writing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

               Will is a solitary figure strolling across the lawn. He stops 
               at Skylar's dorm and knocks on the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

               She emerges. He hands her the paper he was working on. It is 
               her O-chem lab.

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How the hell did you do that?

                                     WILL
                         Didn't your mother ever tell you not 
                         to look a gift horse in the mouth?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I'm supposed to understand this.

                                     WILL
                         You're not going into surgery tomorrow 
                         are you?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No.

                                     WILL
                         Then let's go have some fun.

               With a smile, she relents.

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean and Will in session.

                                     SEAN
                         Really? How'd the date go?

                                     WILL
                         Do you still counsel veterans?
                              (beat)
                         I read your book last night.

                                     SEAN
                         No, I don't.

                                     WILL
                         Why not?

                                     SEAN
                         I gave that up when my wife got sick.

                                     WILL
                         Is that why you didn't write anything 
                         else?

                                     SEAN
                              (smiles)
                         I didn't write anything else 'cause 
                         nobody, including most of my 
                         colleagues bothered to read the first 
                         one.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I've read you colleagues. Your 
                         book was good, Sean.
                              (beat)
                         All those guys were in your platoon?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     WILL
                         What happened to that guy from 
                         Kentucky?

                                     SEAN
                         Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I 
                         kind of lost touch with him after 
                         Nancy got sick.

                                     WILL
                         Do you ever wonder what your life 
                         would be like if you never met your 
                         wife?

                                     SEAN
                         What? Do I wonder if I'd be better 
                         off if I never met my wife?

               Will starts to clarify his question.

                                     SEAN
                         No, that's okay. It's an important 
                         question. 'Cause you'll have your 
                         bad times, which wake you up to the 
                         good stuff you weren't paying 
                         attention to.  And you can fail, as 
                         long as you're trying hard. But 
                         there's nothing worse than regret.

                                     WILL
                         You don't regret meetin' your wife?

                                     SEAN
                         Why? Because of the pain I feel now? 
                         I have regrets Will, but I don't 
                         regret a singel day I spent with 
                         her.

                                     WILL
                         When did you know she was the one?

                         October 21, 1975. Game six of the 
                         World Series. Biggest game in Red 
                         Sox history, Me and my friends slept 
                         out on the sidewalk all night to get 
                         tickets. We were sitting in a bar 
                         waiting for the game to start and in 
                         walks this girl.  What a game that 
                         was. Tie game in the bottom of the 
                         tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, 
                         hit a long fly ball down the left 
                         field line. Thirty-five thousand 
                         fans on their feet, screamin' at the 
                         ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' 
                         up the baseline, wavin' at the ball 
                         like a madman. It hits the foul pole, 
                         home run. Thirty-five thousand people 
                         went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.

                                     WILL
                         Where were you?

                                     SEAN
                         I was havin' a drink with my future 
                         wife.

                                     WILL
                         You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to 
                         have a drink with a woman you had 
                         never met?

                                     SEAN
                         That's right.

                                     WILL
                         So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't 
                         won a World Series since nineteen 
                         eighteen, you slept out for tickets, 
                         games gonna start in twenty minutes, 
                         in walks a girl you never seen before, 
                         and you give your ticket away?

                                     SEAN
                         You should have seen this girl. She 
                         lit up the room.

                                     WILL
                         I don't care if Helen of Troy walked 
                         into that bar! That's game six of 
                         the World Series!

               Sean smiles.

                                     WILL
                         And what kind of friends are these? 
                         They let you get away with that?

                                     SEAN
                         I just slid my ticket across the 
                         table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta 
                         go see about a girl."

                                     WILL
                         "I gotta go see about a girl"? What 
                         did they say?

                                     SEAN
                         They could see that I meant it.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.

                                     SEAN
                         No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I 
                         had gone to see that game I'd be in 
                         here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a 
                         bar twenty years ago. And how I always 
                         regretted not goin' over there and 
                         talkin' to her. I don't regret the 
                         eighteen years we were married. I 
                         don't regret givin' up counseling 
                         for six years when she got sick. I 
                         don't regret being by her side for 
                         the last two years when things got 
                         real bad. And I sure as Hell don't 
                         regret missing that damn game.

               A beat. Will is impressed.

                                     WILL
                         Would have been nice to catch that 
                         game though.

                                     SEAN
                              (breaking)
                         Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was 
                         gonna hit the home run.

               They laugh.

               INT LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               The office is more crowded than usual. TOM and THREE of 
               LAMBEAU'S COLLEAGUES including the esteemed ALEXANDER PEKEC 
               are in the room. Will sits at a work-station which projects 
               a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard. Lambeau stands 
               beside the projected image at the board arguing with Pekec, 
               a foreign mathematician. The image is of a Ramses graph binary 
               tree.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Alexander, I know your theory. The 
                         boy is updating, he's strategy 
                         stealing...

                                     PEKEC
                         With a Ramses graph on the binary 
                         tree--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --But what he's doing, he's attaching 
                         an edge to the adjacent vertex. He 
                         can always failsafe to either side--

                                     PEKEC
                         Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!

               Pekec starts writing lines beside Will's proof on the board.

                                     PEKEC
                         But I can always garbage out
                              (writes frantically)
                         All the way to "N" to the minus one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, there's a limit.

                                     PEKEC
                         The limit is not found!
                              (turns to Will)
                         The limit is not found.

                                     WILL
                         But I can always go to the other 
                         side.

                                     PEKEC
                         There is no proof--

               Lambeau can no longer contain himself.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is 
                         three to the K times--

                                     PEKEC
                         --But--

                                     WILL
                         Look, I wrote it down.

               They turn to Will who places his proof on the projector. The 
               image is cast over their faces. It reads:

               As Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him:

                                     WILL
                         It's just simpler this way.

               Lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Alexander, your theory is changed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Will and Skylar in her room, post coital. They are wrapped 
               in a sheet. Will is absent-mindedly playing the memory game 
               SIMON.

               The pattern grows increasingly complex. After a beat:

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why do we always stay here?

                                     WILL
                         'Cause it's nicer than my place.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I've never seen your place.

                                     WILL
                         Exactly.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What about your friends? Or your 
                         brothers? When do I get to meet them?

                                     WILL
                         They don't come over here that much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I think I can make it to South Boston.

                                     WILL
                         Aah, it's kind of a hike.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is it me you're hiding from them or 
                         the other way around?

                                     WILL
                         All right, all right. We'll go.

                                     SKYLAR
                         When?

                                     WILL
                         Sometime. I don't know. Next week.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What if I said I wouldn't sleep with 
                         you again until you let me meet your 
                         friends?

                                     WILL
                         I'd say...
                              (reaches for phone)
                         It's only four in the mornin', they're 
                         prob'ly up.

               She laughs. Stops him.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You men are shameful. If you're not 
                         thinking of your wiener then you're 
                         acting on its behalf.

                                     WILL
                         Then on behalf of my wiener, I'd 
                         like to ask for an advance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Skylar and Will sit together along with Will's gang. The 
               boys are considerably drunk, but it makes for good 
               entertainment.

               Everyone here is having fun including Sylar.

                                     MORGAN
                         Will, I can't believe you brought 
                         Skylar here when we're all wrecked. 
                         What's she gonna think about us?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity 
                         that we'd be out drinkin'.

                                     BILLY
                         I've been shit faced for like two 
                         weeks.

                                     MORGAN
                         Oh great, tell her that! Now she 
                         really thinks we're problem drinkers!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle 
                         Marty? Will knows him. That guy 
                         fuckin' drinks like you've never 
                         seen! One night he was drivin' back 
                         to his house on I-93 -- Statie pulls 
                         him over.

                                     ALL
                         Oh shit.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Guy's tryin' to walk the line -- but 
                         he can't even fuckin' stand up, and 
                         so my uncle's gonna spend a night in 
                         jail.  Just then there's this fuckin' 
                         BOOM like fifty yards down the road. 
                         Some guy's car hit a tree.

                                     MORGAN
                         Some other guy?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, he was probably drunker than 
                         my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the 
                         cop goes "Stay here" And he goes 
                         runnin' down the highway to deal 
                         with the other crash. So, my Uncle 
                         Marty's standin' on the side of the 
                         road for a little while, and he's so 
                         fuckin' lit, that he forgets what 
                         he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck 
                         it." He gets in his car and drives 
                         home.

                                     MORGAN
                         Holy shit.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So in the morning, there's a knock 
                         on the door it's the Statie. So my 
                         Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" 
                         And the Statie's like "I pulled you 
                         over and you took off."  And my 
                         Uncle's like "I never seen you before 
                         in my life, I been home all night 
                         with my kids." And Statie's like 
                         "Let me get in your garage!" So he's 
                         like "All right, fine." He takes 
                         around the garage and opens the door --
                         and the Statie's cruiser is in my 
                         Uncle's garage.

                                     ALL
                         No way! You're kiddin'!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, he was so hammered that he drove 
                         the police cruiser home. Fuckin' 
                         lights and everything!

                                     MORGAN
                         Did your Uncle get arrested?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed 
                         he didn't do anything. The fuckin' 
                         guy had been drivin' around in my 
                         Uncle's car all night lookin' for 
                         the house.

               Everyone is laughing. Skylar speaks above the din.

                                     SKYLAR
                         There was this Irish guy, walking 
                         down the beach one day.

               She has everyone's attention. Will is nervous.

                                     SKYLAR
                         And he comes across a bottle, and 
                         this Genie pops out. The genie turns 
                         to the Irishman and says -- "You've 
                         released me from my prison, so I'll 
                         grant you three wishes." The Irish 
                         guy thinks for a minute and says 
                         "What I really want is a pint of 
                         Guiness that never empties."  And -- 
                         POOF! A bottle appears. He slams it 
                         down, and -- lo and behold -- it 
                         fills back up again.

               C/U of Will. Hoping the joke pans out.

                         Well, the Irish guy can't believe 
                         it. He drinks it again, and again -- 
                         BOOM!  It fills back up. So, while 
                         the Irish guy is marveling at his 
                         good fortune, The Genie is getting 
                         impatient, because it's hot and he 
                         wants to get on with his freedom. He 
                         says "Let's go, you have two more 
                         wishes." The Irish guy slams his 
                         drink again, it fills back up, he's 
                         still amazed. The Genie can't take 
                         it anymore. He says "Buddy, I'm 
                         boiling out here. What are your other 
                         two wishes?"
                              (beat)
                         The Irish guy looks at his drink, 
                         looks at the Genie and says... "I 
                         guess I'll have two more of these."

               The gang erupts with laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         It's a good thing no one's Irish 
                         here.

                                     MORGAN
                         I'm Irish.

               Chuckie, Will look at Morgan, baffled.

               EXT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER

               Everyone is walking out, saying good-bye. Chuckie goes over 
               to Will and Skylar.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I'm glad you came by, changed my 
                         opinion of Harvard people.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.

               Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know what the fuck you're 
                         doin'.  You're givin' us a ride.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do I look like, Al Cowlins?
                              (seriously)
                         You want to take my car, drop her 
                         off?

                                     WILL
                         I was countin' on it.

                                     MORGAN
                         Chuck, let's go.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' 
                         the car.

               Morgan mumbles something and staggers off. Billy follows 
               with an indifferent shrug.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks, Chuck.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Don't get too slap-happy, you're 
                         takin' me home first.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta 
                         the way.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Just 'cause you don't have to sleep 
                         in the one room palace, don't start 
                         thinkin' you're bad.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (to Will)
                         I thought you said you'd show me 
                         your place.

                                     WILL
                         Not tonight.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, not tonight. Not any other 
                         night.

               He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped 
               like a bad habit.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I wanted to meet your brothers...

               Chuckie gives Will a curious look.

                                     WILL
                         They're all sleepin' now.
                              (a beat, to Chuckie)
                         Let me get those keys.

               INT. FACULTY CLUB -- NIGHT

               A cocktail party is underway. Professors mingle with

               representatives from high tech companies. Lambeau stands 
               holding a drink and surrounded by several RECRUITERS. 
               Apparently he's the star of the show.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         What I want to know, Gerry, is when 
                         we get to meet this wonder-boy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         We're still working together, the 
                         boy's a little rough.

                                     RECRUITER #2
                         We've got our share of eccentric 
                         geniuses at Tri-tech. We know how to 
                         deal with that.

                                     RECRUITER #3
                         I think we all do.

               Laughter.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         If you're not exaggerating, Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty-
                         four when I told you I'd win the 
                         Field's medal within two years?

               More laughter.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         In that case the boy could run 
                         shipping for us, routing--

                                     RECRUITER #2
                         You say he doesn't have a diploma, 
                         but we'll

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         I don't need to see a driver's 
                         license.  I can think of three 
                         departments right now that he could 
                         head up for us.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         At ease, gentlemen. We're looking 
                         carefully at all our options.

                                     RECRUITER #3
                         All right, Gerry. Close to the vest.
                              (gives him his card)
                         Good luck with these vultures.

               He walks off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TIMMY'S TAP -- DAY

               Timmy's Tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the L Street 
               Bar. Sean is at the bar, telling a joke to TIMMY (45) the 
               owner of the place, and several other REGULARS.

                                     SEAN
                         So she goes runnin' up the aisle and 
                         I figure "fuck it" and I yell out 
                         "don't forget the coffee!

               The men erupt in laughter. MARTY, one of the regulars pipe 
               up.

                                     MARTY
                         Bullshit! You didn't say that!

               Timmy and Sean exchange a look.

                                     TIMMY
                         Jesus Christ, Marty. It's a joke.

               Lambeau enters, a bit overdressed in his sport coat and tie.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Not at all.

                                     SEAN
                         Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend 
                         of mine. We went to college together.

                                     TIMMY
                         Good to meet you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Pleasure to meet you.

                                     SEAN
                         Could we get a couple of sandwiches?
                              (beat, smiles)
                         Put it on my tab.

               Sean heads towards a table.

                                     TIMMY
                         You ever plan on payin' your tab?

                                     SEAN
                              (pulls out lottery 
                              ticket)
                         I got the winning numbers right here.

                                     TIMMY
                         What's the jackpot?

                                     SEAN
                         Twelve million.

                                     TIMMY
                         I don't think that'll cover it.

               Lambeau follows [Sean]. They sit.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're here quite a bit, then.

                                     SEAN
                         I live right around the corner.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You moved?

                                     SEAN
                         I been here a couple years.

               There is an awkward moment.

                                     SEAN
                         You wanted to talk about Will?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Seems like it's going well.

                                     SEAN
                         I think so.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, have you talked to him at all 
                         about his future?

                                     SEAN
                         We haven't really gotten into it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Maybe you should. My phone's been 
                         ringing off the hook with job offers.

                                     SEAN
                         Jobs doing what?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks.
                         The kind of place where a mind like 
                         Will's is given free reign.

                                     SEAN
                         That's great, Gerry, that there's 
                         interest -- But I'm not sure he's 
                         ready for that.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, I really don't think you 
                         understand--

                                     SEAN
                         What don't I understand?

               Timmy comes over with the sandwiches.

                                     SEAN
                         Thanks, Timmy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us?
                         We're trying to settle a bet.

                                     TIMMY
                         Uh-oh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you heard of Jonas Salk?

                                     TIMMY
                         Yeah, cured polio.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You've heard of Albert Einstein?

               Timmy smiles. Gives him a look.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard 
                         of him?

                                     TIMMY
                         No.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay thank you, Timmy.

                                     TIMMY
                         So who won the bet?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I did.

               A beat. Timmy leaves.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This isn't about me. I'm nothing 
                         compared to this young man.
                              (beat)
                         Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of 
                         Professors who were renowned for 
                         their study of the universe. But it 
                         was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk, 
                         doing physics in his spare time, who 
                         changed the world, Sean. Can you 
                         imagine if Einstein had given that 
                         up? Or gotten drunk with his buddies 
                         in Vienna every night? All of us 
                         would have lost something. And I'm 
                         quite sure Timmy never would have 
                         heard of him.

                                     SEAN
                         Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He 
                         just hasn't got the direction. We 
                         can give that to him.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         He married his cousin.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Who?

                                     SEAN
                         Einstein. Had two marriages, both 
                         trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his 
                         kids, one of whom, I think, ended up 
                         in an asylum- possible Unabomber 
                         addition--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You see, Sean? That's exactly not 
                         the point. No one remembers that. 
                         They--

                                     SEAN
                         I do.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, you're the only one.

               Beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This boy can make contributions to 
                         the world. We can help him do that.

                                     SEAN
                         Just... take it easy, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look, I don't know what else I can 
                         say.  I'm not sitting at home every 
                         night, twisting my mustache and 
                         hatching a plan to ruin the boy's 
                         life. But it's important to start 
                         early. I was doing advanced 
                         mathematics at eighteen and it still 
                         took me twenty-three years to do 
                         something worthy of a Field's medal.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe he doesn't care about that.

               A beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, this is important. And it's 
                         above personal rivalry--

                                     SEAN
                         Now wait a minute, Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, no you hear me out, Sean. This 
                         young man is a true prodigy--

                                     SEAN
                         Personal rivalry? I'm not getting 
                         back at you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look, you took one road and I took 
                         another. That's fine.

                                     SEAN
                         Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think 
                         it's fine with you. Give him time to 
                         figure out what he wants.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It 
                         worked wonders for you.

               A beat. Lambeau gets up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, I came here today out of 
                         courtesy.  I wanted to keep you in 
                         the loop. As we speak the boy is in 
                         a meeting I set up for him over at 
                         Tri-tech.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, OFFICE -- SAME

               Three well dressed TRI-TECH EXECUTIVES sit around a conference 
               table, which is littered with promotional brochures. The 
               executives exchange a confused look. One of them speaks.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                              (tentative)
                         Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure 
                         what you mean, we've already offered 
                         you a position..

               Cut to reveal: Chuckie sitting across from the executives, 
               hair combed down, wearing his Sunday best.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Since this is obviously not my first 
                         time in such altercations, let me 
                         say this:

               Chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating 
               "cash." The executives are baffled.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Look, we can do this the easy way or 
                         the hard way.

               The executives are completely blank.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         At the current time I am looking at 
                         a number of different fields from 
                         which to disseminate which offer is 
                         most pursuant aid to my benefit.
                              (a beat)
                         What do you want? What do I want? 
                         What does anybody want? Leniency.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I'm not sure--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         --These circumstances are mitigated.
                         Right now. They're mitigated.

               Chuckie puts his hands up, as if getting a vibe from the 
               room.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Okay...

               Chuckie points to the third executive.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         He knows what I'm talking about.

               The third executive is baffled.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         A retainer. Nobody in this town works 
                         without a retainer. You think you 
                         can find someone who does, you have 
                         my blessin'. But I think we all know 
                         that person isn't going to represent 
                         you as well as I can.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Will, our offer starts you at eighty-
                         four thousand a year, plus benefits.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Retainer...

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         You want us to give you cash right 
                         now?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Allegedly, what I am saying is your 
                         situation will be concurrently 
                         improved if I had two hundred sheets 
                         in my pocket right now.

               The executives exchange looks and go for their wallets.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I don't think I... Larry?

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I have about seventy-three...

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Will you take a check?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Come now... what do you think I am, 
                         a juvenile? You don't got any money 
                         on you right now. You think I'm gonna 
                         take a check?

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         It's fine, John, I can cover the 
                         rest.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         That's right, you know.
                              (turns to #1)
                         He knows.

               Chuckie stands up and takes the money.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (to exec #1)
                         You're suspect. I don't know what 
                         your reputation is, but after the 
                         shit you tried to pull today, you 
                         can bet I'll be looking into it. Any 
                         conversations you want to have with 
                         me heretofore, you can have with my 
                         attorney. Gentlemen, keep your ears 
                         to the grindstone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AU BON PAIN COURTYARD, HARVARD SQUARE -- DAY

               Will and Skylar sit in the open courtyard of this Harvard 
               Square eatery. Skylar is working on another O-chem lab. Will 
               sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work.

                                     WILL
                         How's it goin'?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Fine.

                                     WILL
                         Want me to take a look?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No.

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go 
                         to the battin' cages.

                                     SKYLAR
                         It's important that I learn this.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it important to you? If I 
                         inherited all that money, the only 
                         thing important to me would be workin' 
                         on my swing.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Clearly.

                                     WILL
                         You're rich. What do you have to 
                         worry about?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Rich? I have an inheritance. It's 
                         two hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars.  That's exactly what it'll 
                         cost me, minus about five hundred 
                         bucks, to go all the way through med 
                         school. This is what I'm doing with 
                         that money. I could have done anything 
                         I wanted. I could have expanded my 
                         wardrobe, substantially.

                                     WILL
                         Instead you're going to bust your 
                         ass for five years so you can be 
                         broke?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No, so I can be a doctor.

               A beat. Will nods. She looks down, then up.

                                     SKYLAR
                         All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me 
                         ask you a question? Do you have a 
                         photographic memory?

                                     WILL
                         I guess. I don't know. How do you 
                         remember your phone number?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Have you ever studied Organic 
                         Chemistry?

                                     WILL
                         Some, a little.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Just for fun?

                                     WILL
                         I guess so.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Nobody does organic chemistry for 
                         "fun."  It's unnecessary. Especially 
                         for someone like you.

                                     WILL
                         Like me?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah. Someone like you who divides 
                         his time, fairly evenly, between the 
                         batting cages and bars.

               Will laughs.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How did you do that? I can't... I 
                         mean even the smartest people I know, 
                         and we do have a few at Harvard, 
                         have to study- a lot. It's hard.
                              (beat)
                         Listen, Will, if you don't want to 
                         tell me--

                                     WILL
                         Do you play the piano?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come one Will. I just want to know.

                                     WILL
                         I'm trying to explain it to you. So 
                         you play the piano. When you look at 
                         the keys, you see music, you see 
                         Mozart.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.

                                     WILL
                         Well all right, Beethoven. He looked 
                         at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' 
                         guy was deaf when he composed the 
                         Ode to Joy. They had to turn him 
                         around to take a bow because he 
                         couldn't hear the crowd going crazy 
                         behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all 
                         of that music in his head.

                                     SKYLAR
                         So, do you play the piano?

                                     WILL
                         Not a lick. I look at a piano and I 
                         see black and white keys, three pedals 
                         and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, 
                         they looked at it and it just made 
                         sense to them. They saw a piano and 
                         they could play. I couldn't paint 
                         you a picture, I probably can't hit 
                         the ball out of Fenway Park and I 
                         can't play the piano--

                                     SKYLAR
                         But you can do my O-chem lab in under 
                         an hour, you can--

                                     WILL
                         When it came to stuff like that I 
                         could always just play.

               Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will, the Robot-pimp. 
               So much so that Skylar has to kiss him, then push him away.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I can't believe it's taken me four 
                         years to meet you and I'm going to 
                         California in two months, Will.
                              (beat)
                         Have you ever been to California? I 
                         bet you'd like it.

               Will freezes. A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Maybe not.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHUCKIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Chuckie sits on his couch, watching cartoons in his boxers 
               and a tee-shirt, eating cereal. The doorbell rings. He sits.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Get it, ma!

               She doesn't. He gets up. Opens door. It's Skylar.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (surprised)
                         Hey.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Hi.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How you doin'?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Good.

               An awkward beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How'd you know where to find me?

                                     SKYLAR
                              (smiles)
                         You were the only Sullivan in the 
                         phone book.

               Chuckie smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will and I dropped you off here, 
                         remember?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh, right.

                                     SKYLAR
                         This is your house, right?

               Chuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted 
               by a nagging shriek from his mom.

                                     CHUCKIE'S MOM (O.S.)
                         Get in here, Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (calling back)
                         Pipe down, Ma!

                                     SKYLAR
                         I guess so.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What? No. This is my mother's house. 
                         I don't live with my mother. I just 
                         stop by, help out. I'm good like 
                         that.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is this a bad time?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         She'll live.
                              (beat)
                         If she starts yelling again I might 
                         have to run in real quick and beat 
                         her with the stick again but...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Let's take a walk.

               EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY

               Chuckie, still in his boxers walks with Skylar who is talking.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See, now this doesn't feel right.
                              (beat)
                         When I made the decision to come 
                         over here it felt right. I had all 
                         these rationalizations... I just 
                         don't understand why Will never tells 
                         me anything, he won't let me get 
                         close to him, he tells me these weird 
                         lies--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You caught that, huh?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I just wanted to find out what was 
                         going on... But now that I'm here it 
                         seems strange, doesn't it?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well, I don't have no trousers on...

               She laughs. A beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I know why you're here. Will don't 
                         talk much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't care what his family's like 
                         or if he doesn't have any brothers, 
                         but he doesn't have to lie to me.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I really don't know what to say. 
                         Look, I lie to women all the time. 
                         That's just my way.
                              (beat)
                         Last week Morgan brought these girls 
                         down from Roslindale. I told them I 
                         was a cosmonaut. They believed me. 
                         But Will's not usually like that--

                                     MAN ON PORCH
                         Put some clothes on, Sullivan!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Take it easy father!

               She laughs.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All I can say is; I known Will a 
                         long time -- And I seen him with 
                         every girl he's ever been with. But 
                         I've never seen him like this before, 
                         ever with anyone, like how he is 
                         with you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that true?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, it is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Tom and Will are sitting waiting for Lambeau.

                                     TOM
                         !!! !

                                     WILL
                         !!! !

               Lambeau enters going over a thick proof Will has completed.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is correct. I see you used 
                         Mclullen here--

                                     WILL
                         I don't know what it's called.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --This can't be right.
                              (examining proof)
                         This is going to be very embarrassing.
                         Have you ever considered--

                                     WILL
                         I'm pretty sure it's right.

               Will gets up to leave.

                                     WILL
                              (turning back)
                         Can I ask you a favor, can we do 
                         this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I 
                         leave work to come here and the 
                         fuckin' commute is killin' me--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's fine, but did you ever think--

                                     WILL
                         It's right.
                              (a beat, heading out)
                         Take it home with you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, what happened at the Tri-tech 
                         meeting?

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. 
                         So I sent my chief negotiator.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, on your own time, you can do 
                         what you like. When I set up a 
                         meeting, with my associates, and you 
                         don't show up it reflects poorly on 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         Then don't set up any more meetings.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll cancel every meeting right now.
                         I'll give you a job myself. I just 
                         wanted you to see what was out there.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe I don't want to spend my life 
                         sittin' around and explaining shit 
                         to people.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The least you can do is show me a 
                         little appreciation.

                                     WILL
                              (indicates proof)
                         You know how fuckin' easy this is to 
                         me? This is a joke!
                              (crumples proof)
                         And I'm sorry you can't do this. I 
                         really am. 'Cause if you could I 
                         wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble 
                         around and fuck it up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sure, then you'd have more time to 
                         sit around and get drunk. Think of 
                         how many fights you could have been 
                         in by now.

               Will turns around reveling that he's lit the PROOF ON FIRE. 
               Will drops it on the floor. Lambeau drops to his knees and 
               puts it out. He looks up at Will.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're right, Will. I can't do that 
                         proof and you can. And when it comes 
                         to this there are only twenty people 
                         in the world that can tell the 
                         difference between you and me. But 
                         I'm one of them.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I'm sorry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So am I.
                              (beat)
                         Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I 
                         wish I never met you. Because then I 
                         could sleep at night. I wouldn't 
                         have to walk around with the knowledge 
                         that someone like you was out there. 
                         And I wouldn't have to watch you 
                         throw it all away.

               Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the 
               wrinkled proof. He picks it up, smooths it out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar lie in bed. Skylar watches Will sleep. She 
               gets up and goes to the fridge. Returning to the bed:

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will? Are you awake?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come with me to California.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I want you to come with me.

                                     WILL
                         How do you know that?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I know. I just do.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, but how do you know?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't know. I just feel it.

                                     WILL
                         And you're sure about that?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah, I'm sure.

                                     WILL
                         'Cause that's a serious thing you're 
                         sayin'. I mean, we might be in 
                         California next week and you could 
                         find out somethin' about me that you 
                         don't like. And you might feel like 
                         "hey this is a big mistake."
                              (getting upset)
                         But you can't take it back, 'cause 
                         you know it's real serious and you 
                         can't take somethin' like that back. 
                         Now I'm in California, 'cause you 
                         asked me to come. But you don't really 
                         want me there. And I'm stuck in 
                         California with someone who really 
                         doesn't want me there and just wishes 
                         they had a take-back.

                                     SKYLAR
                         "Take-back?" What is that? I don't 
                         want a take-back. I want you to come 
                         to California with me.

                                     WILL
                         I can't go out to California.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why not?

                                     WILL
                         One, because I have a job here and 
                         two because I live here--

                                     SKYLAR
                              (beat)
                         Look, Will if you're not in love 
                         with me, you can say that.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with 
                         you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Then what are you afraid of?

                                     WILL
                         What do you mean "What am I afraid 
                         of?"

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why won't you come with me? What are 
                         you so scared of?

                                     WILL
                         What am I scared of?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, what aren't you scared of?  
                         You live in your safe little world 
                         where nobody challenges you and you're 
                         scared shitless to do anything else--

                                     WILL
                         Don't tell me about my world. You're 
                         the one that's afraid. You just want 
                         to have your little fling with the 
                         guy from the other side of town and 
                         marry--

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that what you think--

                                     WILL
                         some prick from Stanford that your 
                         parents will approve of. Then you'll 
                         sit around with the rest of the upper 
                         crust kids and talk about how you 
                         went slummin' too.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I inherited that money when I was 
                         thirteen, when my father died.

                                     WILL
                         At least you have a mother.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Fuck you! You think I want this? 
                         That money's a burden to me. Every 
                         day I wake up and I wish I could 
                         give that back.  I'd give everything 
                         I have back to spend one more day 
                         with my father. But that's life. And 
                         I deal with it. So don't put that 
                         shit on me. You're the one that's 
                         afraid.

                                     WILL
                         What the fuck am I afraid of?!

                                     SKYLAR
                         You're afraid of me. You're afraid 
                         that I won't love you back. And guess 
                         what?  I'm afraid too. But at least 
                         I have the balls to it give it a 
                         shot. At least I'm honest with you.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not honest?

                                     SKYLAR
                         What about your twelve brothers?

                                     WILL
                         Oh, is that what this is about? You 
                         want to hear that I don't really 
                         have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' 
                         orphan? Is that what you want to 
                         hear?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?

                                     WILL
                         No, you don't want to hear that.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes, I do, Will.

                                     WILL
                         You don't want to hear that I got 
                         cigarettes put out on me when I was 
                         a little kid. That this isn't surgery.

               Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso.

                                     WILL
                         You don't want to hear that. Don't 
                         tell me you want to hear that shit!!

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes I do. Did you ever think that 
                         maybe I could help you? That maybe 
                         that's the point, that we're a team?

                                     WILL
                         What, you want to come in here and 
                         save me? Is that what you want to 
                         do? Do I have a sign that says "save 
                         me" on my back?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't want to "save" you. I just 
                         want to be with you. I love you. I 
                         love you!

               Will, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her.

                                     WILL
                         Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' 
                         bullshit me!

                                     SKYLAR
                              (standing up to him)
                         You know what I want to hear?  I 
                         want to hear that you don't love me. 
                         If you tell me that, then I'll leave 
                         you alone. I won't ask any questions 
                         and I won't be in your life.

               A beat. Will looks Skylar dead in the eye. Lowers his hand.

                                     WILL
                         I don't love you.

               He walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Will leaves pulling on his clothes.

               INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from two N.S.A. AGENTS, OLIVER DYTRESS and 
               ROBERT TAVANO. These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and 
               looking sharp in twin navy blue suits.

                                     WILL
                         So why do you think I should work 
                         for the National Security Agency?

                                     DYTRESS
                         Well, you'd be working on the cutting 
                         edge. You'd be exposed to the kind 
                         of technology you couldn't see 
                         anywhere else because we've classified 
                         it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, 
                         Advanced algorithms--

                                     WILL
                         Codebreaking.

                                     DYTRESS
                         That's one aspect of what we do.

                                     WILL
                         Come on, that's what you do. You 
                         handle more than eighty percent of 
                         the intelligence workload. You're 
                         seven times the size of the C.I.A.

                                     DYTRESS
                         That's exactly right, Will. So the 
                         question as I see it isn't "why should 
                         you work for N.S.A." it's "why 
                         shouldn't you?"

                                     WILL
                         Why shouldn't I work for the National 
                         Security Agency? That's a tough one.

               Will bites his tongue, trying to make this work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy 
               cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both 
               boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear 
               the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE 
               emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in 
                         my mom's room again I'm gonna give 
                         you a fuckin' beatin'!

               After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced.

                                     MORGAN
                              (innocently)
                         What's up guys?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Why don't you beat off at your house?

                                     MORGAN
                         I don't have a VCR at my house.

               Will pays no attention to this exchange

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I never cared about that.

               An awkward beat.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                         No take-backs.

               Will says nothing.

                         Will?

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Take care.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Goodbye.

               Will hangs up. Hold on him for an agonizing beat.

                         I can... I'm almost there.

               Skylar stands at the gate, carry-ons in hand. Her flight is 
               boarding. She looks for Will over the crowd.

               Will picks up a FRAME from Sean's desk. It is CARLTON FISK'S 
               BASEBALL CARD. Will has to smile. Lambeau looks up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What are you smiling at?

                         It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.

               Will can see that Lambeau wants more.

               Will, holding the card, reflects for a beat and puts it down.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean 
                         told me. It's a long story.

               A beat.

                         can do at home.

               Will gets up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, the N.S.A. has been calling me 
                         just about every hour. They're very 
                         excited about how the meeting went.

               Lambeau is excited. Will clearly is not.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         So you might be working for Uncle 
                         Sam.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry says the meeting went well.

                                     WILL
                         I guess.

                                     SEAN
                         What did you think?

                                     WILL
                         What did I think?

               A beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this.

                                     WILL
                         Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody 
                         puts a code on my desk, something 
                         nobody else can break. So I take a 
                         shot at it and maybe I break it. And 
                         I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I 
                         did my job well.  But maybe that 
                         code was the location of some rebel 
                         army in North Africa or the Middle 
                         East. Once they have that location, 
                         they bomb the village where the rebels 
                         were hiding and fifteen hundred people 
                         I never had a problem with get killed. 
                         (rapid fire) Now the politicians are 
                         sayin' "send in the Marines to secure 
                         the area" 'cause they don't give a 
                         shit. It won't be their kid over 
                         there, gettin' shot. Just like it 
                         wasn't them when their number got 
                         called, 'cause they were pullin' a 
                         tour in the National Guard. It'll be 
                         some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel 
                         in the ass.  And he comes home to 
                         find that the plant he used to work 
                         at got exported to the country he 
                         just got back from. And the guy who 
                         put the shrapnel in his ass got his 
                         old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen 
                         cents a day and no bathroom breaks. 
                         Meanwhile my buddy from Southie 
                         realizes the only reason he was over 
                         there was so we could install a 
                         government that would sell us oil at 
                         a good price. And of course the oil 
                         companies used the skirmish to scare 
                         up oil prices so they could turn a 
                         quick buck. A cute, little ancillary 
                         benefit for them but it ain't helping 
                         my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And 
                         naturally they're takin' their sweet 
                         time bringin' the oil back and maybe 
                         even took the liberty of hiring an 
                         alcoholic skipper who likes to drink 
                         seven and sevens and play slalom 
                         with the icebergs and it ain't too 
                         long 'til he hits one, spills the 
                         oil, and kills all the sea-life in 
                         the North Atlantic. So my buddy's 
                         out of work and he can't afford to 
                         drive so he's got to walk to the job 
                         interviews which sucks 'cause the 
                         shrapnel in his ass is givin' him 
                         chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile 
                         he's starvin' 'cause every time he 
                         tries to get a bite to eat the only 
                         blue-plate special they're servin' 
                         is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker 
                         State.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out 
                         for somethin' better. I figure I'll 
                         eliminate the middle man. Why not 
                         just shoot my buddy, take his job 
                         and give it to his sworn enemy, hike 
                         up gas prices, bomb a village, club 
                         a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and 
                         join the National Guard? Christ, I 
                         could be elected President.

                         Define that.

                                     SEAN
                         Someone who challenges you in every 
                         way.  Who takes you places, opens 
                         things up for you. A soul-mate.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

               Sean waits.

                                     WILL
                         Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost, 
                         O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant--

                                     SEAN
                         They're all dead.

                                     WILL
                         Not to me, they're not.

                                     SEAN
                         But you can't give back to them, 
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Not without a heater and some serious 
                         smelling salts, no...

                                     SEAN
                         That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll 
                         never have that kind of relationship 
                         in a world where you're afraid to 
                         take the first step because all you're 
                         seeing are the negative things that 
                         might happen ten miles down the road.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, what? You're going to take the 
                         professor's side on this?

                                     SEAN
                         Don't give me your line of shit.

                                     WILL
                         I didn't want the job.

                                     SEAN
                         It's not about that job. I'm not 
                         saying you should work for the 
                         government. But, you could do anything 
                         you want. And there are people who 
                         work their whole lives layin' brick 
                         so their kids have a chance at the 
                         kind of opportunity you have. What 
                         do you want to do?

                                     WILL
                         I didn't ask for this.

                                     SEAN
                         Nobody gets what they ask for, Will.
                         That's a cop-out.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it a cop-out? I don't see 
                         anythin' wrong with layin' brick, 
                         that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. 
                         Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's 
                         gonna get to work the next day 'cause 
                         of me. There's honor in that.

                                     SEAN
                         You're right, Will. Any man who takes 
                         a forty minute train ride so those 
                         college kids can come in in the 
                         morning and their floors will be 
                         clean and their trash cans will be 
                         empty is an honorable man.

               A beat. Will says nothing.

                                     SEAN
                         And when they get drunk and puke in 
                         the sink, they don't have to see it 
                         the next morning because of you. 
                         That's real work, Will. And there is 
                         honor in that.  Which I'm sure is 
                         why you took the job.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         I just want to know why you decided 
                         to sneak around at night, writing on 
                         chalkboards and lying about it.
                              (beat)
                         'Cause there's no honor in that.

               Will is silent.

                                     SEAN
                         Something you want to say?

               Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

                                     SEAN
                         Why don't you come back when you 
                         have an answer for me.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SEAN
                         If you won't answer my questions, 
                         you're wasting my time.

                                     WILL
                         What?

               Will loses it, slams the door shut.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you!

               Sean has finally gotten to Will.

                                     WILL
                         Who the fuck are you to lecture me 
                         about life? You fuckin' burnout! 
                         Where's your "soul-mate?!"

               Sean lets this play out. Possible "shepard" change.

                                     WILL
                         Dead! She dies and you just cash in 
                         your chips. That's a fuckin' cop-
                         out!

                                     SEAN
                         I been there. I played my hand.

                                     WILL
                         That's right. And you fuckin' lost!  
                         And some people would have the sack 
                         to lose a big hand like that and 
                         still come back and ante up again!

                                     SEAN
                         Look at me. What do you want to do?

               A beat. Will looks up.

                                     SEAN
                         You and your bullshit. You got an 
                         answer for everybody. But I asked 
                         you a straight question and you can't 
                         give me a straight answer. Because 
                         you don't know.

               Sean goes to the door and opens it. Will walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie take crowbars to a wall. This is what they 
               do for a living. As they routinely hammer away, Will becomes 
               more involved in his battle with the wall. Plaster and lathing 
               fly as Will vents his rage. Chuckie, noticing, stops working 
               and takes a step back, watching Will. Will is oblivious.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Lambeau and Tom are in his office. Will is nowhere to be 
               seen.

               Lambeau is on the phone.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What I mean, Sean, is that I'm sitting 
                         in your office and the boy isn't 
                         here.
                              (beat)
                         Well, it's ten past three.
                              (beat)
                         An hour and ten minutes late.
                              (beat)
                         Well, if he doesn't show up and I 
                         have to file a report saying he wasn't 
                         here and he goes back to jail, it 
                         won't be on my conscience, Sean.
                              (beat)
                         Fine.

               He hangs up. Tom picks up a FORM up off the desk.

                                     TOM
                         What should I do?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The boy was here. He came in, sat 
                         down and we worked together.

               A blank look.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He came in, sat down, and we worked 
                         together.

                                     TOM
                         Okay.

               Tom understands, begins filling out the form.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HANRAHAN'S PACKAGE STORE -- LATER

               Will walks out carrying a brown bag. He is filthy, having 
               just knocked off work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- PARKING LOT

               Chuckie is sitting on the hood of his Cadillac, watching 
               Will across the street. Chuckie is covered in grime as well. 
               Will starts walking towards Chuckie. As he draws closer, he 
               heaves a can of Budweiser a good thirty yards, to Chuckie 
               who handles it routinely.

               Will takes a seat next to Chuckie and they crack open their 
               beers. Other workers file out of the site. They drink.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How's the woman?

                                     WILL
                         Gone.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         She went to Medical school in 
                         California.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Sorry, brother.
                              (beat)
                         I don't know what to tell ya. You 
                         know all the girls I been with. You 
                         been with 'em too, except for Cheryl 
                         McGovern which was a big mistake on 
                         your part brother...

                                     WILL
                         Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of 
                         us has herpes.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Some shows are worth the price of 
                         admission, partner.

               This gets a small laugh from Will.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         My fuckin' back is killin' me.

               A passing SHEET METAL WORKER overhears this.

                                     SHEET METAL WORKER
                         That's why you should'a gone to 
                         college.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal 
                         pussy.
                              (beat)
                         So, when are you done with those 
                         meetin's?

                                     WILL
                         Week after I'm twenty-one.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Are they hookin' you up with a job?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, sit in a room and do long 
                         division for the next fifty years.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yah, but it's better than this shit. 
                         At least you'd make some nice bank.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         It's a way outta here.

                                     WILL
                         What do I want a way outta here for?  
                         I want to live here the rest of my 
                         life. I want to be your next door 
                         neighbor. I want to take out kids to 
                         little league together up Foley Field.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Look, you're my best friend, so don't 
                         take this the wrong way, but in 20 
                         years, if you're livin' next door to 
                         me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin'
                         Patriots' games and still workin' 
                         construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. 
                         And that's not a threat, that's a 
                         fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.

                                     WILL
                         Chuckie, what are you talkin'...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Listen, you got somethin' that none 
                         of us have.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it always this? I owe it to 
                         myself? What if I don't want to?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow 
                         I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty 
                         and I'll still be doin' this. And 
                         that's all right 'cause I'm gonna 
                         make a run at it.  But you, you're 
                         sittin' on a winning lottery ticket 
                         and you're too much of a pussy to 
                         cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause 
                         I'd do anything to have what you 
                         got! And so would any of these guys.  
                         It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if 
                         you're still here in twenty years.

                                     WILL
                         You don't know that.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Let me tell you what I do know. Every 
                         day I come by to pick you up, and we 
                         go out drinkin' or whatever and we 
                         have a few laughs. But you know what 
                         the best part of my day is? The ten 
                         seconds before I knock on the door 
                         'cause I let myself think I might 
                         get there, and you'd be gone. I'd 
                         knock on the door and you wouldn't 
                         be there. You just left.

               A beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Now, I don't know much. But I know 
                         that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Lambeau stands across from Sean, seething.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is a disaster! I brought you in 
                         here to help me with this boy, not 
                         to run him out--

                                     SEAN
                         Now wait a minute--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --And confuse him--

                                     SEAN
                         --Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         And here I am for the second week in 
                         a row with my professional reputation 
                         at stake--

                                     SEAN
                         Hold on!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Ready to falsify documents because 
                         you've given him license to walk 
                         away from this.

                                     SEAN
                         I know what I'm doing and I know why 
                         I'm here!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look Sean, I don't care if you have 
                         a rapport with the boy -- I don't 
                         care if you have a few laughs -- 
                         even at my expense! But don't you 
                         dare undermine what I'm trying to do 
                         here.

                                     SEAN
                         "Undermine?"

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He has a gift and with that gift 
                         comes responsibility. And you don't 
                         understand that he's at a fragile 
                         point--

                                     SEAN
                         He is at a fragile point. He's got 
                         problems--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What problems does he have, Sean, 
                         that he is better off as a janitor 
                         or in jail or hanging around with--

                                     SEAN
                         Why do you think he does that, Gerry?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He can handle the work, he can handle 
                         the pressure and he's obviously 
                         handled you.

                                     SEAN
                         Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor?
                         Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because 
                         the first thing that happened to him 
                         was that he was abandoned by the 
                         people who were supposed to love him 
                         the most!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, come on, Sean--

                                     SEAN
                         And why does he hang out with his 
                         friends? Because any one of those 
                         kids would come in here and take a 
                         bat to your head if he asked them 
                         to. It's called loyalty!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, that's nice--

                                     SEAN
                         And who do you think he's handling?  
                         He pushes people away before they 
                         have a chance to leave him. And for 
                         20 years he's been alone because of 
                         that. And if you try to push him 
                         into this, it's going to be the same 
                         thing all over again. And I'm not 
                         going to let that happen to him!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now don't do that. Don't you do that!
                         Don't infect him with the idea that 
                         it's okay to quit. That it's okay to 
                         be a failure, because it's not okay! 
                         If you're angry at me for being 
                         successful, for being what you could 
                         have been--

                                     SEAN
                         --I'm not angry at you--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. 
                         And I'm not going to apologize for 
                         any success that I've had.

                                     SEAN
                         --I don't have any anger at you--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes you do. You're angry at me for 
                         doing what you could have done. Ask 
                         yourself if you want Will to feel 
                         that way for the rest of his life, 
                         to feel like a failure.

                                     SEAN
                         That's it. That's why I don't come 
                         to the goddamn reunions!  Because I 
                         can't stand the look in your eye 
                         when you see me! You think I'm a 
                         failure! I know who I am. I'm proud 
                         of who I am. And all of you, you 
                         think I'm some kind of pity case! 
                         You with your sycophant students 
                         following you around. And your Goddamn 
                         Medal!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is that what this is about, Sean? 
                         The Field's Medal? Do you want me to 
                         go home and get it for you? Then 
                         will you let the boy--

                                     SEAN
                         I don't want your trophy and I don't 
                         give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew 
                         you when!! You and Jack and Tom 
                         Sanders. I knew you when you were 
                         homesick and pimply-faced and didn't 
                         know what side of the bed to piss 
                         on!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right!  You were smarter than 
                         us then and you're smarter than us 
                         now! So don't blame me for how your 
                         life turned out. It's not my fault.

                                     SEAN
                         I don't blame you! It's not about 
                         that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause 
                         he's a good kid! And I won't see 
                         this happen to him- won't see you 
                         make him feel like a failure too!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He won't be a failure!

                                     SEAN
                         If you push him into something, if 
                         you ride him--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am 
                         today because I was pushed. And 
                         because I learned to push myself!

                                     SEAN
                         He's not you!

               A beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean turns 
               to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway.

                                     WILL
                         I can come back.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, that's fine, Will. I was just 
                         leaving.

               There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and 
               leaves.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I'm here.
                              (beat)
                         So, is that my problem? I'm afraid 
                         of being abandoned? That was easy.

                                     SEAN
                         Look, a lot of that stuff goes back 
                         a long way. And it's between me and 
                         him and it has nothing to do with 
                         you.

                                     WILL
                         Do you want to talk about it?

               Sean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk.

                                     WILL
                         What's that?

                                     SEAN
                         Oh, this is your file. I have to 
                         send it back to the Judge with my

               Sean smiles.

                                     WILL
                         So what's it say?

               INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

               From a child's P.O.V. we see a man, partially obscured by a 
               doorframe. The man turns toward the P.O.V.

                              (after a pause)
                         My dad used to make us walk down to 
                         the park and collect the sticks he 
                         was going to beat us with. Actually 
                         the worst of the beatings were between 
                         me and my brother. We would practice 
                         on each other trying to find sticks 
                         that would break.

                                     WILL
                         He used to just put a belt, a stick 
                         and a wrench on the kitchen table 
                         and say "choose."

               INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

               A large, callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick.

                         I used to go with the wrench.

                         Cause fuck him, that's why.

               A long quiet moment.

                         Is that why me and Skylar broke up?

                         I didn't know you had. Do you want 
                         to talk about that?
                              (beat)
                         I don't know a lot, Will. But let me 
                         tell you one thing. All this history,

               Will, who had been looking away, loos at Sean.

               Sean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child. Will 
               sobs like a baby. After a moment, he wraps his arms around 
               Sean and holds him, even tighter. We pull back from this 
               image. Two lonely souls being father and son together.

               Will rides the Red Line, above ground. He looks out over the 
               landscape. Small back yards, laundry hangs from wire lines.

               Chainlink fences, overgrown with weeds.

               Will walking through South Boston. He cuts through a park. A 
               senior citizen is spearing trach for the city.

               Will at home. Not reading. Looks up at the ceiling.

               Will walks up to a nondescript building, he walks through 
               the glass doors, into the lobby.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The guard reaches for the phone.

                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

                         Save it for your mother, funny guy. 
                         We heard it before.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh, Morgan.

               They both get up, in one another's face. This is a play fight.

               "You gonna start?" "You gonna pay my hospital bills?"

                                     WILL
                         Sorry to miss this.

               Will comes back from the bathroom.

                              (to Chuckie)
                         You and Morgan throw?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, I had to talk him down.

                                     WILL
                         Why didn't you yoke him?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, 
                         dude.  I'd rather fight a big kid, 
                         they never fight, everyone's scared 
                         of 'em. You know how many people try 
                         to whip Morgan's ass every week? 
                         Fuckin' kid won't back down.

                                     MORGAN
                              (from across the table)
                         What'd you say about me?

                         Shut the fuck up.

               Billy walks in the door and give Chuckie a look. Chuckie 
               turns to Will.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (To Will)
                         Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.

                                     MORGAN
                         You thought we forgot, didn't you? I 
                         know I'm gettin' my licks in.

               Laughter as the boys converge on Will. He goes willingly out 
               the door.

               EXT. L STREET -- CONTINUOUS

               As they come out the door, rather than beating Will 
               mercilessly, they stop. Morgan goes into his own, personal 
               rendition of "Danny Boy." No one joins in.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Shut up, Morgan.
                              (to Will)
                         Here's your present.

               Chuckie indicates an old CHEVY NOVA, parked illegally in 
               front of the bar.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, I figured now that you got 
                         your big job over in Cambridge, you 
                         needed some way to get over there 
                         and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you 
                         every day...

               Laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

                                     MORGAN
                         No I didn't...

               Will approaches the car to take a closer look.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         But you're twenty-one now, so--

                         Yeah, now that you can drink legally, 
                         we thought the best thing to get you 
                         was a car.

               More laughter. Will inspects the Nova.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.
                              (a beat)
                         This is the ugliest fuckin' car I 
                         ever seen in my life.

               Laughter, a beat.

                         How the fuck did you guys do this?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Me and Bill scraped together the 
                         parts, worked on it. Morgan was out 
                         panhandlin' every day.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose 
                         fuckin' router you think sanded out 
                         all that bondo?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Guy's been up my ass for two years 
                         about a fuckin' job. I had to let 
                         him help with the car.

                                     WILL
                         So, you finally got a job Morgan?

                                     MORGAN
                         Had one, now I'm fucked again.

                                     WILL
                              (to Chuckie)
                         So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai 
                         engine under there? Can I make it 
                         back to my house?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Fuck you. I re-built the engine 
                         myself.  That thing could make it to 
                         Hawaii if you wanted it to.

               Chuckie gives Will a look.

                         Happy 21, Will.

               Will sits across from Sean.

                         Which one did you take, Will?

                                     WILL
                         Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs 
                         Professor Lambeau set me up with. I 
                         haven't told him yet, but I talked 
                         to my new boss over there and he 
                         seemed like a nice guy.

                                     SEAN
                         That's what you want?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I think so.

                                     SEAN
                         Good for you. Congratulations.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks you.
                              (a beat)
                         So, that's it? We're done?

                                     SEAN
                         We're done. You did your time. You're 
                         a free man.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         I just want you to know, Sean...

                                     SEAN
                         You're Welcome, Will.

                                     WILL
                         I'll keep in touch.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I 
                         don't know where I'll be.

               Will smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         I just... figured it's time I put my 
                         money back on the table, see what 
                         kind of cards I get.

               Will smiles. Sean hands him a piece of paper.

                                     SEAN
                         I'll be checking in with my machine 
                         at the college. If you ever need 
                         anything, just call.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Do what's in your heart, son. You'll 
                         be fine.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks you, Sean.

               They embrace.

                                     SEAN
                         No. Thank you.

                              (re: embrace)
                         Does this violate the patient/doctor 
                         relationship?

                                     SEAN
                         Only if you grab my ass.

               They laugh.

                                     WILL
                         See ya.

                              (surprised)
                         Will.

                         You know, you're no longer required 
                         to come here.

                                     WILL
                         I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.

                         Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He 
                         says you start working for them next 
                         week.

                         I just want you to know... It's been 
                         a pleasure.

                                     WILL
                         Bullshit.

               They laugh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This job... Do it if it's what you 
                         really want.

                                     WILL
                         I appreciate that.

               A moment. Will starts to go, Lambeau watches him for a beat, 
               Will turns back around.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, Gerry.

                         need some help, or you get stuck 
                         again, don't be afraid to give me a

                         Thank you, Will. I'll do that.

               Will smiles, turns and walks away.

                         So I hear you're taking some time.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd 
                         travel some. Maybe write a little 
                         bit.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Where're you going?

                                     SEAN
                         I don't know. India maybe.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Why there?

                                     SEAN
                         Never been.

               Lambeau nods.

                         Do you know when you'll be back?

                              from his desk)
                         I got this mailer the other day. 
                         Class of Sixty-five is having this 
                         event in six months.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I got one of those too.

                                     SEAN
                         You should come. I'll buy you a drink.

               Lambeau smiles.

                         Sean...

               A beat.

                         The drinks at those things are free.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Hell, I know that.

               Both men laugh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         How about one now?

                                     SEAN
                         Sounds good.

               They start to walk out.

                                     SEAN
                         It's on you though, until eight 
                         o'clock tonight when I win my money.

               Sean pulls out his lottery ticket. They start out down the 
               hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Sean, do you have any idea what the 
                         odds are against winning the lottery?

                                     SEAN
                         I don't know... Gotta be at least 
                         four to one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         About thirty million to one.

                                     SEAN
                         You're pretty quick with those 
                         numbers.  How about the odds of me 
                         buying the first round?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         About thirty million to one.

               Begin final sequence.

               A wide, establishing shot of Sean's apartment complex as the 
               sun is setting. The lights are on in one unit. A tighter 
               shot reveals Sean, in his apartment, packing his belongings 
               in cardboard boxes.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT, STREET -- SAME

               The camera cranes down from Sean's window and onto the street, 
               where we pan to reveal Will, sitting in his car and looking 
               up at Sean as he packs his things. Will's car is packed full 
               of clothes and books.

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- SAME

               Chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the Cadillac.

               Morgan and Billy ride in the back, leaving the shotgun seat 
               open for Will.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Will holds an envelope which he slips in Sean's mailbox. He 
               puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at Sean in his 
               apartment who is still unaware that Will is there.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie pulls up in front of Will's house. He honks the horn, 
               waits a beat, then gets out and heads toward the house.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Will drives away from Sean's house. Sean hears the car pull 
               out and looks out the window. Sean sees Will's car pulling 
               away.

               Curious, he investigates.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie walks up Will's front steps.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Sean walks out to the sidewalk and looks around. Seeing the 
               mailbox flag has been raised, he walks over to it.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie knocks on Will's front door. There is no answer. He 
               waits a beat, looks in the window. An incredulous smile slowly 
               starts to form.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Sean opens the card Will left for him. It reads:

                         that job, just tell him, "Sorry, I 
                         had to go see about a girl."

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the 
               broad smile. He knows Will is gone. He shrugs in explanation 
               to the guys. Morgan takes Will's seat as they pull away from 
               the curb.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               We pan up from the letter to Sean. A broad smile comes over 
               him.

               This is a look we haven't seen. Sean is truly happy.

               EXT. MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE -- SUNSET

               Will is on the road, driving away. As we pull back and credits 
               roll, the car disappears into the horizon.

                                         THE END

1	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
	SHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV - 

	Moving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can
	see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
	As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
	and PHRASES as though from a public address system.

2	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN

	in cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is
	BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading.

3	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY

	Thousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there.

4	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY

				BEN
		- and today it is right that we
		should ask ourselves the one most
		important question: What is the
		purpose of these years, the purpose
		for all this demanding work,
		the purpose for the sacrifices
		made those who love us?  Were
		there NOT a purpose, then all of
		these past years of struggle, of
		fierce competition and of uncom-
		promising ambition would be mean-
		ingless.  But, of course, there
		is a purpose and I must tell it
		to you.  I ask you to remember
		this purpose always and I pledge
		that I shall endeavor to carry it
		with me forever.

5	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

	staring at him impassively.

6	INTERCUT BETWEEN SHOTS

	of impassive students, seated, watching; of Ben standing
	alone on the huge amphitheatre stage; of CLOSEUPS of Ben
	speaking; of loudspeakers; of wind-blown papers on the
	podium.

7	EXT. PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
			(continuing)
		The purpose, my fellow graduates - 
		the purpose is -

	He stops, trying to think of the word.

8	CLOSEUP - BEN

	He begins to sweat.

9	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE

	watching.

10	SHOT - PODIUM of AMPHITHEATRE

	Ben's hands searching through the pages of his speech.
	The pages begin to blow away in the wind.

11	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

	staring.

12	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
		- there is a reason, my friends,
		and the reason is - 

13	CLOSEUP - BEN

	He is in a panic.  He looks up from his papers at the audience.

14	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	The audience is gone.

15	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
		- the reason is - the purpose is -

	SOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at
	us through the air.

16	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	Huge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE

		Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
		to begin our descent into Los Angeles -

	SOUND of a SONIC BOOM.

								CUT TO:

17	INT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT

	His eyes open suddenly.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE
		The sound you have just heard is the
		landing gear locking into place.  The
		Los Angeles weather is clear and the
		temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do
		not expect any traffic delay and will
		make our four hour and eighteen minute
		flight plan smack on the nose.  We
		enjoyed having you on board and look
		forward to seeing you again in the near
		future.

18	SHOT

	PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with
	snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the
	ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them.

19	REVERSE ANGLE

	PULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers
	staring straight ahead, their headsets on.  Ben turns and
	looks out the window.

20	EXT. LOS ANGELES - FROM THE AIR - NIGHT

	Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every
	direction.

	SOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH.

	START OF MAIN TITLES

	UNDER titles:

				STEWARDESS' VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your
		seat belts in preparation for the landing
		and observe the no smoking sign.  After
		we land, you will notice an increase in
		the sound level as the thrust of the engines
		is reversed to help reduce forward speed.

21	INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK - NIGHT

	Ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Your attention, please!  American Airlines
		Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop
		to New York is now leaving from Gate
		Number 40.  All aboard, please.

28	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	His eyes are open and he is trying to remember something.
	There are the SOUNDS of many people TALKING and LAUGHING
	in other rooms.  A RADIO nearby PLAYS MUSIC.  After a
	while, there is the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING.  The SOUNDS
	of the people TALKING are lower.  MRS. TERHUNE'S voice
	can be heard among them.

				MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE

		-- associate editor of the college
		newspaper in his junior year - 
		managing editor in his senior
		year -

	The SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
	the VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
	VOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
	remainder of the sequence.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
	being SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
	falls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
	SNAPPED OFF.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What's the matter?

	Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		The guests are all downstairs,
		Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

				BEN
		Look, Dad - could you explain to
		them that I have to be alone for
		a while?

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		These are all our good friends,
		Ben.  Most of them have known you
		since - well - practically since
		you were born.

	Ben has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
	as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What is it, Ben?

	The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

				BEN
		I'm just - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- worried?

				BEN
		Well - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		About what?

				Ben
		I guess - about my future.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		What about it?

				BEN
		I don't know.  I want it to be -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		To be what?

				BEN
			(quietly)
		Different.

	As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
	MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Is anything wrong?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		No!  No - we're just on our way
		downstairs!

	Mr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
	picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Carlsons' are here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to Mrs. Braddock)
		They are?
			(to Ben)
		Come on.

	Mr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They came all the way from
		Tarzana.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		It's a wonderful thing to have
		so many devoted friends.

	They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

29	INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

	PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
	Braddocks are moving down.

				MR. CARLSON
		Hey - there's our award winning
		scholar.

				MRS. CARLSON
		We're all very proud of you,
		Ben.

				BEN
		Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

				MR. CARLSON
		Is that the new car out there?
		The little red Wop job?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		That's Ben's graduation present.

				MR. CARLSON
			(putting his arm
			across Ben's shoulder)
		Won't have much trouble picking
		them up in that, will you?

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. CARLSON
		The girls.  The chicks.  The -
		the teeny boppers.

				MRS. CARLSON
		I think Ben has gotten beyond
		the teeny bopper stage - haven't
		you, Ben?

	Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
	and return the wink politely.

				BEN
		Yes, ma'am.

	They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

				BEN
		Excuse me - I think I'd just
		like to check something on
		the car for a minute -

	Ben moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
	steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Here's the track star himself.
		How are you, track star?

				BEN
		Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

	Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
	hall.

				MR. LOOMIS
		I want to get a drink and then
		I want to hear all about that
		thing you won.  That Hopperman
		award.

				BEN
		Helpingham.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Helpingham!  Right!  Now you
		wait right here.

	Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
	moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
	the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
	lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

				LADY 1
		Ben - we're all so proud of
		you.

				LADY 2
		Proud, proud, proud, proud,
		proud.

				LADY 3
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I was going to go upstairs for a
		minute -

				LADY 3
		No - I meant with your future.

				LADY 2
		With your life.

				BEN
		Well - that's a little hard to say -

	MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben!

				Ben
			(to the ladies)
		Excuse me.
			(he turns around)
		Mr. McQuire

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(overwhelmed with pride)
		Ben.

				BEN
		Mr. McQuire.

	Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
	toward the back of the house and out through the back door.

30	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
	TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben - I just want to say one word to
		you - just one word -

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Are you listening?

				BEN
		Yes I am.

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(gravely)
		Plastics.

	They look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Exactly how do you mean?

				MR. MCQUIRE
		There is a great future in plastics.
		Think about it.  Will you think
		about it?

				BEN
		Yes, I will.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

	Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
	people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

				WOMAN #1
		Here he is now.  Here's Ben.

				BEN
		Excuse me just a minute -

	Ben goes into the house through the back door.

31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his
	way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he
	goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room.

	SOUND of a door SLAMMING.

32	INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the
	PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a
	window, the SOUND of the WIND.

32A	SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location)

	Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door
	OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh.  I guess this isn't the
		bathroom, is it?

				BEN
		It's down the hall.

	They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you, Benjamin?

				BEN
		Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is
		down at the end of the hall.

	Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
	of the bed.

				BEN
		Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
		mean to be rude but -

	Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
	lights it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is there an ashtray in here?

				BEN
		No.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh - I forgot.  The track star
		doesn't smoke.

	She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
	the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
	to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
	wastebasket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it a girl?

				BEN
		Is what a girl?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Whatever it is you're upset
		about.

				BEN
		Oh - no.  I'm just sort of
		disturbed about things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In general.

				BEN
		That's right.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to ask you
		something.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you take me home?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband took the car.  Will
		you drive me home?

	Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
	a set of car keys.

				BEN
		Here - you take it.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him.

				BEN
		Do you know how to work a
		foreign shift?

	Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.

				BEN
		You don't?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.
			(there is a pause)

				BEN
		Let's go.

	She throws the keys to him.  He catches them.

								CUT TO:

33	EXT. BRADDOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING THROUGH THE OPEN FRONT DOOR.  Mr. Braddock is
	talking to the Terhunes at the door.  Ben and Mrs.
	Robinson come down the hall.

				BEN
		Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride
		home.  I'll be right back.

	Mr. Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder.  Mrs. Robinson
	is walking ahead through the front door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(as she passes the
			CAMERA)
		Wonderful party.

								CUT TO:

34	OMITTED

35	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway.  They sit
	for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	She doesn't move.  Ben gets out and goes around to her side
	and opens the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you come in, please?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want you to come in till I get
		the lights on.

				BEN
		What for?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't feel safe until
		I get the lights on.

	They move to the door.  She takes out her key and opens
	the door.

36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you mind walking ahead of
		me to the sun porch.  I feel
		funny about coming into a dark
		house.

				BEN
		But it's light in there now.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please.

	Ben turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?  Bourbon?

				BEN
		Look - I drove you home.  I was
		glad to do it.  But I have some
		things on my mind.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		All right then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?

	He looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
		way, but I don't want to be
		alone in this house.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please wait till my husband
		gets home.

				BEN
		When is he coming back?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't know.

	She pours herself a drink.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drink?

				BEN
		No.

	She hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

				BEN
		Are you always this much afraid
		of being alone?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, why can't you just lock
		the doors and go to bed?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'm very nuerotic.

	She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I ask you a question?

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you think of me?

				BEN
		What do you mean?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You've known me nearly all of
		your life.  You must have
		formed some opinion.

				BEN
		Well - I've always thought
		that you were a very - nice -
		person.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know I was an alcoholic?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know that?

				BEN
		Look - I think I should be
		going -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
		mind my saying so - this
		conversation is getting a
		little strange.  Now I'm sure
		that Mr. Robinson will be here
		any minute and -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband will be back quite
		late.

	They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He should be gone for several
		hours.

	She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
	retreats around the other side of the chair.

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Pardon?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What's wrong?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
		I mean you didn't expect -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean - you didn't really
		think that I would do something
		like that.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Like what?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I don't know.

				BEN
		For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
		here we are, you've got me into
		your house.  You give me a
		drink.  You put on music, now
		you start opening up your
		personal life to me and tell
		me your husband won't be home
		for hours.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		So?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
		to seduce me.

	There is a pause.  She looks at him.

				BEN
			(weaker)
		Aren't you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.
		I feel rather flattered that
		you -

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
		me for what I just said?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's all right.

				BEN
		It's not all right, it's the
		worst thing I've ever said
		to anyone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down.

				BEN
		Please forgive me.  Because I
		like you.  I don't think of you
		that way.  But I'm mixed up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now finish your drink.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
		that I said that to you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'll forget it right now.
		Finish your drink.

				BEN
		What is wrong with me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you ever seen Elaine's
		portrait?

				BEN
		Her portrait?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We had it done last Christmas.
		Would you like to see it?

				BEN
		Very much.

	We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
	into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
	the doorway to Elaine's room.

37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

				BEN
		Elaine certainly is an
		attractive girl, isn't she?

	In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

				BEN
			(looking at the
			portrait)
		I don't remember her as having
		brown eyes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you unzip my dress?

	He steps back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I think I'll go to bed.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, goodnight.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Won't you unzip my dress?

				BEN
		I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you still think I'm trying
		to seduce you -

				BEN
		No, I don't.  But I just feel
		a little funny.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - you've known me all
		your life.

				BEN
		I know that.  But I'm -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Come on.

	She turns her back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's hard for me to reach.

	Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	Ben walks toward the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What are you so scared of?

				BEN
		I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then why do you keep running
		away?

				BEN
		Because you're going to bed.  I
		don't think I should be up here.

	Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Haven't you ever seen anybody
		in a slip before?

				BEN
		Yes, I have -

	He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

				BEN
		But I just - Look - what if Mr.
		Robinson walked in right now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What if he did?

				BEN
		Well, it would look pretty
		funny, wouldn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you think he trusts us
		together?

				BEN
		Of course he does.  But he
		might get the wrong idea.
		Anyone might.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't see why.  I'm twice as
		old as you are.  How could
		anyone think -

				BEN
		But they would!  Don't you see?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm not trying to
		seduce you.  I wish you'd -

				BEN
		I know that.  But please, Mrs.
		Robinson.  This is difficult
		for me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why is it?

				BEN
		Because I am confused about
		things.  I can't tell what
		I'm imagining.  I can't tell
		what's real.  I can't -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you like me to seduce you?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is that what you're trying to
		tell me?

				BEN
		I'm going home now.  I apologize
		for what I said.  I hope you can
		forget it.  But I'm going home
		right now.

	Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
	CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
	stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
	the stairs and starts down.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		BENJAMIN?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring up my purse before
		you go?

				BEN
		I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

	Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall.  Her back is to us.
	She is holding her dress in front of her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I really don't want to put this
		on again.  Won't you bring it
		up?

				BEN
		Where is it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On that chair in the hall.

	She walks out of the shot.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BEN
		Well here's the purse.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Could you bring it up?

				BEN
		Well I'll hand it to you.

	Ben starts back up the stairs.

				BEN
		Come to the railing and I'll
		hand it up.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin - I am getting pretty
		tired of all this suspicion.
		Now if you won't do me a simple
		favor I don't know what.

	Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

				BEN
		I'm putting it on the top step.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		For God's sake, Benjamin, will
		you stop acting that way and
		bring me the purse?

	Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
	down the hall.

				BEN
		I'm putting it here by the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring it in to me?

				BEN
		I'd rather not.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		All right.  Put it in the room
		where we were.

				BEN
		Right.

38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
	bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
	back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
	movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
	turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
	door to the bedroom behind her.

				BEN
		Oh God.

	She smiles.

				BEN
		Let me out.

	She turns the lock on the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't be nervous.

				BEN
		Get away from that door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want to say something first.

				BEN
		Jesus Christ!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I want you to know
		I'm available to you.  If you
		won't sleep with me this time -

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you won't sleep with me this
		time, Benjamin, I want you to
		know you can call me up any
		time you want and we'll make
		some kind of arrangement.

				BEN
		Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand what I said?

				BEN
		Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I find you very attractive
		and any time -

	There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
	Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
	struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
	the hall and down the stairs.

39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT

	Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of
	FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets
	the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
	SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Is that Ben's car in front?

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		Yes, sir!

	FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters.

				BEN
		I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson
		home.  She wanted me to drive
		her home so I - I drove her home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Swell.  I appreciate it.

				BEN
		She's upstairs.  She wanted me
		to wait down here till you got
		home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Standing guard over the old
		castle, are you?

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

	Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Here.  It looks like you need
		a refill.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I've got to go.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is anything wrong?  You look
		a little shaken up.

				BEN
		No.  No - I'm just - I'm just
		a little worried about my
		future.  I'm a little upset
		about my future.

	Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Come on.  Let's have a nightcap
		together.

	Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
	Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
	and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
	turns and brings him the drink.

				BEN
		Thank you very much, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - how old are you now?

				BEN
		Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one
		next week.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(taking out a
			cigarette)
		That's a hell of a good age
		to be.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I wish I was that age again.
		Because, Ben -

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. ROBINSON
		You'll never be young again.

				BEN
		I know.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, can I say something to
		you?

				BEN
		What?

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have we known each
		other now?

	Ben shakes his head.

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have you and I known
		each other?  How long have
		your Dad and I been partners?

				BEN
		Quite a while.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I've watched you grow up, Ben.

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		In many ways I feel as though
		you were my own son.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		So I hope you won't mind my
		giving you a friendly piece
		of advice.

				BEN
		I'd like to hear it.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I think - I think you
		ought to be taking it a little
		easier right now than you seem
		to.

	Ben nods.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Sow a few wild oats.  Take things
		as they come.  Have a good time
		with the girls and so forth.

	Mrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the
	dress she wore earlier.  Ben starts to get up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't get up.

	Ben sits.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I was just telling Ben here he
		ought to sow a few wild oats.
		Have a good time while he can.
		You think that's sound advice?

	Mrs. Robinson nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I do.

				BEN
		I've got to go.

	He stands.  Mr. Robinson stands up with him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You have yourself a few flings
		this summer.  I bet you're
		quite a ladies' man.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?  You look like the kind
		of guy that has to fight them
		off.
			(to Mrs. Robinson)
		Doesn't he look to you like
		the kind of guy who has to
		fight them off?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, he does.

	They start out of the sunroom.

40	INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT

				MR. ROBINSON
		Oh say - Elaine gets down from
		Berkeley on Saturday.

				BEN
		Oh yes.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I want you to give her a
		call.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Great.

	Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.

41	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house.  Ben comes toward
	the car.  Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light
	behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you for taking me home.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll see you soon, I hope.

	Ben continues to walk toward us.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen - your
		attention, please - for this after-
		noon's feature attraction.

								CUT TO:

42	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
	the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
	and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
	LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
	fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
	door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
	side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
	as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
	ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
	Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
	Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
	too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
	old for them.

	Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
	house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
	end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Hey, over there -- I mean you!
		Your attention please!

	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
	house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
	in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Are you ready in there, feature
		attraction?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Could I speak to you for a second,
		Dad?

	But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
	and is readdressing his audience.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- what was I saying?

				MRS. ARNOLD
		Feature attraction.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see
		you're paying attention.  A
		feature attraction that will be
		one of the most astounding
		events ever to take place in
		this particular backyard.

	They all laugh and some applaud.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Now I'm going to ask for a big
		round of applause to bring this
		boy out here - wait a minute -
		let me amend that - to bring
		this young man out here - because
		today he is twenty-one-years-
		old -

				MR. ARNOLD
			(his hands like
			a megaphone)
		Let's get on with the show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Just hang on a minute because
		I have a few words to say -

				MR. ARNOLD
		You always do.

	They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
	he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
	comeback.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - could we just talk about
		this for a second?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Twenty-one-years-old, ladies
		and gentlemen; four of those
		years spent accomplishing some
		rather extraordinary things at
		one of our nation's leading
		seats of learning -

				MR. ARNOLD
		Bring him out!

				PETER AND LOUISE
		On with the show!  On with the
		show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to the window)
		I can't hold them much longer,
		Ben.  You better get out here.

				BEN'S VOICE
		I'd like to discuss this.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to his audience)
		This boy - I'm sorry - this
		young man - is soon to continue
		his education as a Frank Halping-
		ham Award Scholar - but before
		he does -

	Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- before he does -
			(to the window)
		You're disappointing them, Ben.
		You're disappointing them.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - can you listen -

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(meaning it)
		I'll give you ten seconds.
			(back to the
			people)
		He is going to give us a
		practical demonstration of
		what I feel safe in saying is
		a pretty exciting birthday
		present - and it better work
		or I'm out over two hundred
		bucks - so let's hear it for -

	Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
	It slams against the wall inside.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- Benjamin Braddock!

44	INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY

	At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
	dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
	on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
	mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
	He holds a spear gun in his hand.

	The people applaud.

45	EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV

	The people in the backyard.  His father stands just
	outside the screen door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Folks - this remarkable young
		man is going to perform for you
		some spectacular and amazing
		feats of daring in water that is
		over six feet deep -

	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
	down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
	the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
	apparatus in it.

	SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
	SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
	applauding and chattering noiselessly.

	We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
	is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
	delivering his now soundless pitch.

	We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
	pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
	motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
	joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
	begin to motion us toward them.

	We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
	us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
	of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
	under.  He has a big smile.

	We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
	figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
	of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
	the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
	fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
	encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
	smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
	under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)

	Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at
	the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking
	down into it.

	PULL UP AND UP AND UP

	Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,
	swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing,
	sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools.
	SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
	of the WIND.

	Hold for a few seconds, then:

	SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

								DISSOLVE TO:

47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
	the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds
	the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite
		know how to put this -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Look - I was thinking about that
		time after the party -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		- and I was wondering if I could
		buy you a drink or something -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		Uh - The Taft Hotel.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Did you get a room?

				BEN
		No.  Now I know it's pretty
		late and if you'd rather -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Give me an hour.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'll be there in an hour.

	SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
	uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
	carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
	leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
	lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
	doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
	out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
	to each other and helping each other out of the door and
	down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
	and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
	Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
	PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
	him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
	moves back against the other door, holding it open and
	allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
	pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
	lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
	them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
	and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

	The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
	him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
	where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
	and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
	looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
	the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
	keys dangling suggestively.

				ROOM CLERK
		Can I help you, sir!

				BEN
		What?  Oh - no - I'm just -

	He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
	people.

				ROOM CLERK
		Are you here for an affair,
		sir?

	Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
	helplessly at the clerk.

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		The Singleman party, sir?

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.

				ROOM CLERK
		It's in the main ballroom.

				BEN
		Ahh - thank you.

	Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
	He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
	to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

	What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
	He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

	What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
	him.

	Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
	as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
	affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

48	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	As Ben steps inside.

				VOICE
		Hello.

	Ben turns.  Four people stand in a row.  Official greeters,
	they are:  A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY
	LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they
	are smiling with great determination.

				BEN
		Hello.

	It is the older lady who has said hello.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		You must be one of the Porters.

	She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm not -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'd like you to know my sister,
		Miss DeWitte -

	MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has
	been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.

				MISS DeWITTE
		How do you do?

				BEN
		How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

	Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's
	hand.

				BEN
			(apologetically)
		Oh - sorry -

				JEFFREY SINGLEMAN
		Fine, thank you.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		That's Jeffrey, of course.

	Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand.

				BEN
		Of course.

				MR. SINGLEMAN
		I didn't get your name, sir.

				BEN
		Benjamin Braddock, sir.

	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been
	holding.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Braddock - Braddock?

				BEN
		Yes, but I'm afraid -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'll find your table in a moment.
		Braddock.  Not Braniff?  We have
		a Braniff.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm just looking
		for a friend.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'm afraid I don't understand.

				BEN
			(backing off)
		I'm not with your party - I'm
		sorry.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Hey - I don't get it.

	Ben is backing out.

				MISS DeWITTE
		I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr.
		Braniff.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Angela - please!

	Ben backs out of the ballroom.

49	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben crosses the lobby, passing PEOPLE going in and out of
	the hotel.  He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room:

50	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the
	windows that look out over the hotel grounds.  It is quite
	dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen
	people seated around.

	The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room
	and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table
	by the window.

	PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

								CUT TO:

51	ANGLE ON BEN

	sitting smoking.

								CUT TO:

52	NEW ANGLE ON BEN

	sitting.

								CUT TO:

53	NEW ANGLE ON BEN

	sitting drinking.

								CUT TO:

54	ANGLE ON BEN

	In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson.
	She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts
	toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does
	not see her approach.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh.  Hello.  Hello.

	He rises quickly.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I sit down?

				BEN
		Of course.

	He pulls out a chair, for her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	They sit down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you?

				BEN
		Very well.  Thank you.

	Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down
	at the center of the table.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I have a drink?

				BEN
		A drink?  Of course.

	Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.
	The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs.
	Robinson apologetically.

				BEN
		He didn't see me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Waiter!

	For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The
	waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter
	moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back.
	The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I will have a martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Yes, madam.

	The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to be so nervous,
		you know.

				BEN
		Nervous.  Well, I am a bit
		nervous.  I mean it's - it's
		pretty hard to be suave when
		you're -

	He shakes his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you get us a room?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you gotten us a room yet?

				BEN
		I haven't.  No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to?

				BEN
		Well - I don't.  I mean I could.
		Or we could just talk.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want me to get it?

				BEN
		You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to get it now?

				BEN
		Now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I don't know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you get it.

				BEN
		Why don't I get it?  Well -
		I will then.
			(he stands up)
		If you'll excuse me.

	Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

55	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.

				ROOM CLERK
		Yes sir?

				BEN
		A room.  I'd like a room,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		A single room or a double
		room?

				BEN
		A single.  Just for myself,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		Will you sign the register,
		please?

	He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his
	name on the card and then stares at it for a moment,
	crumples it up and fills out a second card.

				ROOM CLERK
		Is anything wrong, sir?

				BEN
		What?  No.  Nothing.

				ROOM CLERK
			(taking a key from
			behind the counter)
		Do you have any luggage, Mister --
			(looks at registration
			card)
		Gladstone?

				BEN
		Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is it?

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is your luggage?

				BEN
		Well it's in the car.  It's
		out in the car.

				ROOM CLERK
		Very good, sir.  I'll have a
		porter bring it in.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				ROOM CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		I mean I'd - I'd rather not
		go to the trouble of bringing
		it all in.  I just have a
		toothbrush.  I can get it my-
		self.  If that's all right.

				ROOM CLERK
		Of course.

	Ben reaches for the key.

				ROOM CLERK
		I'll have a porter show you the
		room.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as
		soon find it myself.  I just have
		the toothbrush to carry up and
		I think I can manage it myself.

				ROOM CLERK
		Whatever you say, sir.

	He hands Ben the key.

				BEN
		Thank you.

56	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays
	absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips
	her martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Mrs. Robinson.

	She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table
	with a telephone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

	The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to
	the table and hands her the receiver.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	The waiter nods and leaves.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(into phone)
		Hello.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		It's Benjamin.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Benjamin Braddock.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin -- where are you?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you look through the glass.

	Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the
	glass into the lobby.

57	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES

	Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty
	feet away.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you see me now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I can.

58	INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH

	Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the
	glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in
	the Veranda Room.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

				BEN
		I got a single room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's fine.

				BEN
		But there's one thing.  The desk clerk
		seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
		I mean - I don't know what their policy
		is - but -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well - do you want to go up first?

				BEN
		Yes - I think that would be good.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll be up in five minutes.

				BEN
		Well - goodbye then -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Isn't there something you want to
		tell me?

				BEN
		To tell you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I want you to know how much
		I appreciate this - really -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The number.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The room number, Benjamin.  I think
		you ought to tell me that.

				BEN
		Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.
		It's 512.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you
		later, Mrs. Robinson.

	He hangs up.

59	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - SHOT - BEN

	He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby.

60	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts
	to pat his breast pocket.

				BEN
		I've got it.

	The desk clerk looks up.

				BEN
		I say I've got it.

				CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		The toothbrush.  I got it all right.

				CLERK
		Very good, sir.

				BEN
		Yes.  Well - goodnight.

				CLERK
		Goodnight, sir.

	Ben walks out of shot.

60A	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and
	opens door.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against
	it for a few moments looking at the room.  The only light
	is that coming in the window.  Ben turns on the light switch
	on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light
	from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch
	off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on
	the light.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area
	through the window.  Ben closes the blinds.

61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and
	opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her
	purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the
	mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room,
	finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

	He clears his throat and then he kisses her.

				BEN
		Well.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll get undressed now.  Is that all
		right?

				BEN
		Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just
		stand here?  I mean - I don't know
		what you want me to do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you watch?

				BEN
		Oh - sure.  Thank you.

	She takes off her jacket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you bring me a hanger?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		A hanger.

	Ben opens the closet door.

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  Wood?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Wood or wire?  They have both.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Either one will be fine.

				BEN
		Okay.

	He brings her a hanger.  She puts her jacket on it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you help me with this,
		please?

	She turns her back.

				BEN
		Certainly.

	He undoes the zipper at her neck.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.

	She turns and looks at him.  He backs away.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would this be easier for you
		in the dark?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I can't do
		this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You what?

				BEN
		This is all terribly wrong.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -
		I think you're the most attractive
		of all my parents' friends.
		I just don't think we could
		possibly --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you afraid of me?

				BEN
		No - but look - maybe we could
		do something else together,
		Mrs. Robinson - would you like
		to go to a movie.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, is this your first time?

				BEN
		Is this - what?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It is, isn't it?  It is your
		first time.

				BEN
		That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
		That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You can admit that, can't you?

				BEN
		Are you kidding?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's nothing to be ashamed of -

				BEN
		Wait a minute!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On your first time -

				BEN
		Who said it was my first time.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That you're afraid -

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		 - of bring - inadequate -  I mean
		just because you happen to be
		inadequate in one way - 

				BEN
		INADEQUATE!

	LONG pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(starting to dress)

				BEN
		Don't move.

	He slams the bathroom door shut.  The light in the room
	disappears.

	FADE IN

62	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool
	and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the
	pool.  Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds
	a beer can in one hand.

	SOUNDS:  teenagers YELLING and swimming in nearby pools;
	a radio PLAYING rock and roll; a television set TUNED to
	a ball game.

65	CLOSE SHOT - BEN

	SOUND of the back door CLOSING.  Ben opens his eyes and
	moves his head slightly.

66	WHAT HE SEES

	Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire.  Mrs.
	Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some
	ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.

67	SHOT - BEN

	He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool.  He
	climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a
	chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and
	goes through.

68	INT. SPECIAL SET - TAFT HOTEL ROOM

	Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.  He
	is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.

	PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson
	who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace-
	let and watch.  He moves to a chair and sits.

	He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next
	to the chair.  Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in
	front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt.

	He takes the cigarette out of his mouth.

69	INT. SPECIAL SET - BRADDOCK DEN AND DINING ROOM - NIGHT
	SHOT - NEW ANGLE

	We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock
	den, in which Ben is sitting.  In the dining room, Mr.
	and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking
	through the doorways toward Ben.  Ben stands, crosses back
	to the door to the den and shuts it.

70	INT. BRADDOCK DEN - NIGHT - REVERSE

	On Ben's back as he returns to the chair and sits.  A
	television set, facing the chair, is on.  Ben picks up a
	can of beer and drinks from it.  An animated cartoon is
	playing on the television set.  Ben watches it.

	CLOSEUP Ben watching.  PULL BACK and we are in the Taft
	Hotel Room.  Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against
	the headboard, watching the television set which is on a
	stand facing the bed.

	SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern.

	PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light
	from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot,
	half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television
	set and goes out of frame.  Ben continues to stare at the set.

	SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up.

	Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way.

	SOUND of BRACELETS being put on.

	Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

	SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped
	closed.  Mrs. Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying
	her purse, passes through again and, without looking at
	Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and
	exits.

76	INT. BENS' ROOM - CLOSEUP - BEN - DAY

	SOUND of DOOR closing.  Follow Ben as he gets up and moves
	to the windows of what is now his BEDROOM in the Braddock
	house.  He opens the closed blinds over the window.  The
	sun is bright outside.  His bathing suit is on the window
	sill.  He takes the suit and puts it on.  He moves to
	the bedroom door, opens it and goes out.

77	OMITTED

78	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	We see Mrs. Braddock in the kitchen.  Ben comes through
	the back door, moves to the pool and dives in.  The raft
	floats in the center of the pool.

79	SHOT - UNDERWATER

	Ben swims toward us the length of the pool.

80	SHOT - AT THE WATERLINE

	Ben surfaces and, in one movememt, pulls himself up on
	the raft and - 

								CUT TO:

	- lands on top of Mrs. Robinson on the bed.  He stays
	on top of her for a moment.

	Ben turns toward us and looks.

		Well - I would say that I'm
		just drifting.

								CUT TO:

83	SHOT - BEN ON RAFT

				BEN
		- here - in the pool.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Why?

				BEN
		Well - it's very comfortable -
		just to drift here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Have you thought about graduate
		school?

				BEN
		No.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Would you  mind telling me then -
		what were those four years of
		college for?  What was the point
		of all that hard work?

				BEN
		You got me.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(trying unsuccessfully
			to control himself)
		Now listen, Ben.  I think it's
		a very good thing that a young
		man - after he's done some very
		good work - should have a chance
		to relax and enjoy himself, and
		lie around, and drink beer and
		so on.  But after a few weeks
		I believe that person would
		want to take some stock in him-
		self and his situation and start
		to think about getting off his
		ass.

	Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Robinson's are here.

	Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out
	the sun.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with
		yourself these days?

				BEN
		Oh - not too much.  Taking it
		easy.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's what I'd do if I could.
		Nothing wrong with that.  Hey
		Ben, Elaine's coming down from
		Berkeley soon.  I want you to
		call her up this time.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Because I just think you two
		would hit it off real well
		together.

	Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them.  (A long pause)

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Say hello to Mrs. Robinson,
		Benjamin.

		Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

							DISSOLVE TO:

85	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben, halfway dressed to go out, in slacks, shirt and tie,
	sits in a chair.  The door opens and Mrs. Braddock enters.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Can I talk to you a minute?

				BEN
		Sure.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you
		something but you don't have to
		tell me if you don't want.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well I'm going to ask you what
		you do when you go off at night.

				BEN
		When I go off?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		You don't have to tell me if
		you don't want.

				BEN
		No, I do.  I want to tell you.

	There is a pause.

				BEN
		I drive around.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What else?

				BEN
		Nothing else.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well you don't drive around from
		midnight until noon the next
		day, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh, no.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Then what do you do?  Do you
		meet someone?

				BEN
		Meet someone?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well this is your business,
		Benjamin.
			(she starts toward
			the door)
		If you -

				BEN
		No wait.  Wait.

	She stops.

				BEN
		I don't meet anyone, mother, but
		why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin, I'm not going to pry
		into your affairs, but I'd
		rather you didn't say anything
		at all than be dishonest.
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, wait.

	She looks at him.

				BEN
		You think I'm being dishonest?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well why do you - why do you
		think that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Because I know you don't drive
		around for twelve hours.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
		tell you what I do?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Not if you don't want to.

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But I don't want you to make
		up something.

				BEN
		I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
		proud of what I do.  I usually
		get kind of drunk.  I usually
		drive over to Los Angeles and
		go to some bars and get kind of
		drunk.  Then I take a hotel
		room.  So I won't have to drive
		home on the freeway.  I mean it
		kind of scares me to drive home
		after - 

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		You believe me, don't you?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		No.

				BEN
		You don't?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		But I want you to.  Please. Please
		will you believe me.

91	INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - SHOT - BEN

	Mrs. Robinson's hands are undoing his necktie.  Ben is
	dressed as in previous scene, plus a jacket.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.
			(he pushes her
			hand away)
		Sit down a minute.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.

				BEN
		Will you please sit down a
		minute.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches
	down to take off a shoe.

				BEN
		Will you leave that shoe on for
		a minute.  Please.

	She straightens up.

				BEN
		Now - do you think we could say
		a few words to each other first
		this time?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you want.

				BEN
		Good.  I mean are we dead or
		something?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I just don't think we have
		much to say to each other.

				BEN
		All we ever do is come up here
		and throw off the clothes and
		leap into bed together.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you tired of it?

				BEN
		I'm not.  No.  But do you think
		we could liven it up with a
		few words now and then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well what do you want to talk
		about?

				BEN
		Anything.  Anything at all.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to tell me about
		some of your college experiences?

				BEN
		Oh my God.

			MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best
		we can do let's just get the god-
		damn clothes off and --

	She reaches for her shoe.

				BEN
		Leave it on!  Now we are going to
		do this thing.  We are going to
		have a conversation.  Think of
		another topic.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How about art.

				BEN
		Art.  That's a good subject.
		You start it off.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You start it off.  I don't know
		anything about it.

				BEN
		Oh.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you?

				BEN
		Yes I do.  I know quite a bit
		about it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go ahead then.

				BEN
		Art.  Well what do you want to
		know about it.

	She shrugs.

				BEN
		Are you interested more in modern
		art or more in classical art.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Neither.

				BEN
		You're not interested in art?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Then why do you want to talk
		about it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

	Ben nods and looks at the rug.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I take off my clothes now?

				BEN
		No.  Think of another topic.
		Tell me what you did today.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you really want me to?

				BEN
		Yes I do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.

	Ben starts shaking his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to hear it or not?

				BEN
		Yes.  But you might try and spice
		it up with a little originality.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.  I ate breakfast and
		went shopping.  During the after-
		noon I read a novel.

				BEN
		What one.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		What novel did you read.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't remember.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then I fixed supper for my husband
		and waited until -

				BEN
		There!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
		There's something we could have
		a conversation about.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Him?

				BEN
		I mean everything.  I don't know
		anything about how you - how you
		work this.  I don't know how you
		get out of the house at night.  I
		don't know the risk involved.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There isn't any.

				BEN
		There's no risk?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		How do you get out of the house?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I walk out.

				BEN
		You walk right out the door.

	She nods.

				BEN
		What do you say to him?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He's asleep.

				BEN
		Always?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, this isn't a very
		interesting topic.

				BEN
		Please.  Now tell me.  How do
		you know he won't wake up
		sometime and follow you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because he takes sleeping pills.
		He takes three sleeping pills
		every night at ten o'clock.

				BEN
		But what about the noise from
		the car.  What if -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The driveway's on my side of
		the house.

				BEN
			(smiling)
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Calm down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Now let's keep going here.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I undress and talk at the
		same time?

				BEN
		Right.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Now.  You say the driveway's on
		your side of the house.  So I
		guess you don't sleep in the
		same room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We don't.

				BEN
		So you don't - I mean I don't
		like to seem like I'm prying
		but I guess you don't sleep
		together or anything.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No we don't.

				BEN
		Well how long has this been going
		on.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at the
			ceiling for a moment)
		About five years.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		You have not slept with your
		husband for five years?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Now and then.  He geats drunk a
		few times a year.

				BEN
		How many times a year.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
		his birthday.

				BEN
		Man, is this interesting.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		So you don't love him.  You
		wouldn't say you -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We've talked enough, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't
		say you loved him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not exactly.

				BEN
		But you don't hate him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
		Unhook my blouse.

				BEN
			(unhooking her blouse)
		Well how do you feel about him,
		then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

				BEN
		Well that's kind of a bad
		situation then, isn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		I mean it doesn't sound like it
		could be much worse.  If you
		hated him at least you'd hate
		him.

	She nods and takes off her blouse.

				BEN
		Well you loved him once, I
		assume.  When you first knew
		him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I never did, Benjamin.  Now
		let's -

				BEN
		Well, wait a minute.  You married
		him.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you do that?

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(taking off her
			stockings)
		See if you can guess.

				BEN
		Well I can't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Think real hard, Benjamin.

				BEN
		I can't see why you did, unless
		...you didn't have to marry him
		or anything, did you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't tell Elaine.

				BEN
		Oh no.  You had to marry him
		because you got pregnant?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you shocked?

				BEN
		Well I never thought of you and
		Mr. Robinson as the kind of
		people who...

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now let's get to bed.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
		So how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean do you feel like telling
		me what were the circumstances?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not particularly.

				BEN
		Was he a law student at the time?

	She nods.

				BEN
		And you were a student also.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		At college.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		What was your major?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why are you asking me all this?

				BEN
		Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
		Now what was your major subject
		at college?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Art.

				BEN
		Art?

	She nods.

				BEN
		But I thought you - I guess you
		kind of lost interest in it over
		the years then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Kind of.

				BEN
		Well how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How do you think.

				BEN
		I mean did he take you up to
		his room with him?  Did you go
		to a hotel?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, what does it possibly
		matter?

				BEN
		I'm curious.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'd go to his car.

				BEN
		Oh no.  In the car you did it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't think we were the first.

	Ben thinks for a moment.

				BEN
		What kind of car was it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Do you remember the make of the
		car?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh my God.

				BEN
		Really.  I want to know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It was a Ford, Benjamin.

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
		Ford!  That's great!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's enough.

				BEN
		So old Elaine Robinson got started
		in a Ford.

	There is a pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't talk about Elaine.

				BEN
		Don't talk about Elaine?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't want you to.

	She walks to the bed.

				BEN
		Well why don't you?

	She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
	jacket.

				BEN
		I wish you'd tell me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There's nothing to tell.

				BEN
		Well why is she a big taboo
		subject all of a sudden?

	Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

				BEN
		Well - I guess I'll have to ask
		her out on a date and find out
		what's --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, don't you ever take
		that girl out.

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand that?

				BEN
		Well look.  I have no intention
		of taking her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		I was just kidding around.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		But why shouldn't I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I have my reasons.

				BEN
		Then let's hear them.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
		Robinson.  Because I think I
		know what they are.

	She pulls the covers down.

				BEN
		I'm not good enough for her to
		associate with, am I?  I'm not
		good enough to even talk about
		her, am I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Let's drop it.

				BEN
		We're not dropping it.  Now
		that's the reason, isn't it?
		I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
		I?  I'm not fit to -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		I'm good enough for you but I'm
		too slimy to associate with
		your daughter.  That's it, isn't
		it?  ISN'T IT?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		You go to hell.  You go straight
		to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
		think I'm proud of myself?  Do
		you think I'm proud of this?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I wouldn't know.

				BEN
		Well, I'm not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You're not.

				BEN
		No sir.  I am not proud that I
		spend my time with a broken-
		down alcoholic!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I see.

				BEN
		And if you think I come here
		for any reason besides pure
		boredom, then you're all wrong.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Because - Mrs. Robinson this
		is the sickest, most perverted
		thing that ever happened to
		me.  And you do what you want
		but I'm getting the hell out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you?

				BEN
		You're goddamn right I am.

	He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
	the bed and watches him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's how you feel about me.

	He nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That I'm a sick and disgusting
		person.

				BEN
		Now don't start this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Don't start acting hurt.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you expect me to be a
		little hurt?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
		and tell me I'm not good enough
		for your daughter.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did I say that?

				BEN
		Of course you did.

	She shakes her head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to apologize
		to you if that's the impression
		you got.

				BEN
		Well two minutes ago you told
		me I wasn't good enough for
		your daughter.  Now you say
		you're sorry I got that
		impression.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I didn't mean it.  I don't think
		you'd be right for each other.
		But I would never say you
		weren't as good a person as
		she is.

				BEN
		You wouldn't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Of course I wouldn't.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

				BEN
		What are you doing?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well it's pretty obvious you
		don't want me around any more.

				BEN
		Well look - I was kind of upset
		there.  I'm sorry I said those
		things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If that's how you feel -

				BEN
		But it's not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(smiling at him)
		That's all right.  I think I
		can understand why I'm disgusting
		to you.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I
		wouldn't keep coming here if
		I didn't like you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But if it's sickening for you -

				BEN
		It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
		forward to it.  It's the one
		thing I have to look forward
		to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to say that.

				BEN
		Well I wouldn't.  I would never
		say it if it wasn't true.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I stay then?

				BEN
		Yes. Please.  I want you to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Well don't thank me, because I
		want you to.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But you won't ever take out
		Elaine, will you?  I want you
		to promise me that.

	There is another long pause.

				BEN
		Look.  Why the hell did you
		bring this up.  It never
		occured to me to take her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then give me your word you won't.

				BEN
		This is absurd.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Promise me, Benjamin.

				BEN
		All right, for christ's sake.
		I promise I will never take
		out Elaine Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.
			(pause)
		Benjamin -

				BEN
		Let's not talk about it.  Let's
		not talk at all.

	At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each
	other, they begin to take off their clothes.

								FADE OUT

	FADE IN

92	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

	Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking
	at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
	are there.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Elaine's back from school.  I
		think it might be a nice gesture
		if you asked her out.

	Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
	eating and reading.

								CUT TO:

93	INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the
	doorway.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't you think that she's a
		terribly attractive girl?
		Because I think she's one of
		the prettiest girls I've
		ever seen.

	Ben gives a small whimper.

								CUT TO:

94	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
	Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
	is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
	down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
	in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
	Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to
	swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
	their heads above the surface.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		It's pretty embarrassing.  I
		really don't know what to tell
		Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward
		and strained for me every time
		he suggests that you call up
		Elaine.

				BEN
		Next time he suggests it,
		I'll tell him I have no
		intention of ever calling
		her up in my life.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess she's not good enough
		for you, is that it?

				BEN
		Look - Elaine Robinson and I
		do not get along.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		How do you know?  You haven't
		seen her since high school.  I
		guess your evenings, whatever
		you do with them, are just too
		valuable.

				BEN
		That has nothing to do with it -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
		that you're just too busy every
		evening - doing God knows what -

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't go on like this.  Now if
		Benjamin absolutely refuses to
		take her out -

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		- then I'll simply invite all the
		Robinsons' over for dinner on
		Thursday.

95	SHOT - BEN

	He slides off the raft and goes underwater.

96	SHOT - BEN UNDERWATER

	His hair streaming up, his eyes open.

97	INT. SPECIAL SET BRADDOCK DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a
	table for two are seated, jammed in against each other,
	the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
	back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
	facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
	the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
	eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
	Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
	continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
	Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

							CUT TO:

98	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the
	pool.

	Mr. and Mrs. Braddock cling exhausted to the raft and
	try to smile at each other.

	SOUND:  Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes.

	The door opens.  Mr. Robinson stands there with a huge

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Braddock - it's about

		Come on in.  I'm afraid the
		young lady isn't quite ready
		yet -

	Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.  Mrs. Robinson is
	sitting there.

				BEN
		Hello.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What would you say to a short one?
		Bourbon still your drink?

				BEN
		Yes.

	Mr. Robinson hands him drink.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I'll see if she's ready.

		Hello.

101	CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON

							LAP DISSOLVE TO:

102	EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

	SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE in Ben's car.  From the back.  Ben
	leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in
	and out of the traffic.  Ben is wearing dark glasses.

				ELAINE
		You're living at home now.  Is
		that right?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		Do you know what you're going
		to do?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Are you going to graduate school?

				BEN
		No.

	He leans on the HORN.  The car directly ahead of him
	does not move to the right.  Ben jerks his car over to the
	right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn
	down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the
	driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him.
	Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.

				ELAINE
		Do you always drive like this?

				BEN
		Yes.

								CUT TO:

103	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	A drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed WAITERS.
	Ben and Elaine are seated at a table.

				BEN
		Do you want some dinner?

				ELAINE
		I'd love some.

	A waiter moves forward toward them.

				BEN
		Bring a menu.

				WAITER #2
		Dinner for two, sir?

				BEN
		No.  Just for her.

	The waiter moves away.

				ELAINE
		Aren't you eating?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Why not?

				BEN
		If it's all right with you,
		I'm not hungry.

	The waiter returns with a menu.

				ELAINE
		I've changed my mind.  Thank
		you.

104	EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - SHOTS

	Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.

105	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the
	entrance.  Without turning around, he waits for Elaine
	who has difficulty following him.  As she gets to him,
	he starts forward again.  He starts up the stairs.
	Elaine is just behind him.

								CUT TO:

106	INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled.  A tuxedoed HOOD leads
	them through the tables to a table directly under the stage
	on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her
	dress.  There is one chair facing the stage, the other with
	its back to and up against the stage.  Ben sits down in
	the chair facing the stage.  Elaine stands for a moment,
	unsure.

				BEN
		Sit down.

	Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage.
	She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
	Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and
	puts them on.  The two chairs are slightly angled toward
	each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without
	looking directly at Elaine.

				BEN
		Why don't you watch the show?

	The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - do you dislike me
		for some reason?

				BEN
		No - why should I?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

107	SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER

	She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.  She is
	twirling the tassels.

				BEN
		You're missing a great effect
		here.

	Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns
	back.

				BEN
		How do you like that?

	Elaine doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Could you do it?

				ELAINE
		No.

	The stripper sees Elaine look.  The stripper smiles toward
	Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she
	walks.  Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.

	The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair.  The
	spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's
	face.  As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield
	her eyes.

	The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it
	and holds it up in the air.  The music stops and a
	DRUM ROLL starts.  The stripper bends over Elaine's head
	and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in
	front of Elaine's face.

108	SHOT - BEN

	He leans forward slightly to watch the action.  The
	swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.

	The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster.  The tassels
	swing more frantically.

109	SHOT - ELAINE

	She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.

110	SHOT - BEN

	With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.

111	SHOT - ELAINE

	Through Ben's glasses.  Elaine's face seen darkly but
	fully for the first time.  The tassels swing in front
	of it.  Tears start out of her eyes.

112	SHOT - BEN

	He reaches up to remove the glasses.

113	SHOT - ELAINE

	As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh
	spill from the spotlight.  The tears are running down
	her face.  Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight
	at Ben.

114	SHOT - BEN

	With his glasses off, he watches her.  He reaches forward
	and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.

				STRIPPER
		Hey!

	Some of the customers start to boo.  Ben rises, takes
	Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.

								CUT TO:

115	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	The entrance to the strip joint.  Elaine runs to the
	bottom of the steps.  The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside
	is crowded with people moving back and forth.  Ben follows
	her.  She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk.  Ben
	catches her and holds her arm.

				BEN
		Elaine - I'm sorry.

	Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls
	her arm away.

				ELAINE
		Will you take me home now?

				BEN
		I'm sorry I took you in there.

				ELAINE
		I think I'd better go home now
		please.

				BEN
		But, Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Where is the car?

				BEN
		I just want to tell you something.

	Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying
	to get her to look at him.  She keeps looking away.

				ELAINE
		I want to go home.

				BEN
		But could I just tell you this
		one thing?

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		This whole idea - this date
		and everything.  It was my
		parents' idea.  They forced me
		into it.

				ELAINE
		Oh - that's very nice of
		you to tell me.

				BEN
		No.  What I mean is - that's
		why I've been acting this way.
		I'm not like this.  I hate
		myself like this.

	She starts to cry.  People on the sidewalk are looking at
	them.  She turns away from them.  Ben moves away from
	them.  Ben moves around in front of her.

				BEN
		Listen - could you stop crying,
		please?

				ELAINE
		No, I couldn't.

				BEN
		But could you try?

				ELAINE
		No.

	She brings both hands up to her face.  Ben looks at her
	for a few moments in agony.  Then, very determined, he
	takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from
	her face.  She looks up startled.  She starts to give a
	little cry but before she can he is kissing her.  She closes
	her eyes.

	He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side
	of her face.  He opens his hands against her face, freeing
	her hands.  Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang
	on.  After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly
	to one side.

				BEN
		Elaine -

	He starts to pull her head back.

				ELAINE
		Not here.  Not here.

116	EXT. DRIVE IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in
	restaurant.  There are trays hooked onto windows along
	side of both of them.  They are eating and drinking
	furiously.

				BEN
		I've had this feeling - ever
		since I've graduated - this -
		kind of compulsion that I have
		to be rude all the time.  Do
		you know what I mean?

				ELAINE
		Yes, I do.

	He looks at her.

				BEN
		It's like I've been playing
		some kind of - game - but the
		rules don't make any sense to
		me -

	She is watching him carefully.

				BEN
		- they're being made up by all
		the wrong people - no - I mean
		no one makes them up, they seem
		to have made themselves up.

	A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the
	slot on their right.  Its RADIO is tuned into a rock
	and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY.  Ben leans
	across Elaine and speaks through the window to the
	kid behind the wheel.

				BEN
		Say - I wonder if I could request
		you to turn that down a little?

	The kid turns the radio up.  Ben and Elaine roll their
	windows up.

117	SERIES OF SHOTS

	From outside of car.  Ben is talking with great animation
	- Elaine is watching him.  They are both eating as Ben
	talks, telling Elaine a story.  Their windows are rolled

	sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's
	hand touching her shoulder.  It is very quiet.

				ELAINE
		Well - maybe I'd better go in.

	He nods.  They continue to sit there for another long
	moment.

				ELAINE
		Would you like to come in?  I
		could make some coffee.

				BEN
		No, I mean - I wouldn't want to
		wake anyone up.

				ELAINE
		We won't.  Let's go inside.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				ELAINE
		Is anything wrong?

				BEN
		No - I was just thinking -
		look - it's still early -

	There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off
	the road.

				ELAINE
		What is the matter?

				BEN
		Nothing.  I'm just wondering if

120	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the

122	EXT. TAFT HOTEL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off

	speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He
	turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his
	head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head.

				BEN
		Elaine - I like you.  I like you

	She nods.

				BEN
		Do you?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		You're the first - you're the

	She takes his hand.

				BEN
		I mean my whole life is such a

	He turns off the engine.

	She nods.

				ELAINE
		Was she married or something?

	It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package.
	From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
	Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is
	playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the
	Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door
	of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out,
	dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps,
	reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side
	and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drive down the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I have a date

		Listen to me very carefully,

	Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down

		Mrs. Robinson -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I can makes things quite unpleasant.

				BEN
		How?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In order to keep Elaine away

				BEN
		I don't believe you.

		Go home now.

				BEN
		I just don't believe you would do that.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Try me.

	There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.  Then
	he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on
	his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package.

	TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive-
	way toward the Robinson house.  Ben gets to the front
	door.

				BEN

		Elaine!

126	INT. ROBINSON HALLS, STAIRS, DOOR TO ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben runs in.

				BEN
		Elaine?

				ELAINE'S VOICE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		I'm coming up.

				ELAINE'S VOICE
		I'm not dressed yet.

	Ben runs up the stairs.  He still carries the package.
	Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door
	to her bedroom.  She is wearing a skirt and slip and
	carrying one shoe.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed -

	Ben pushes her back into her room.

127	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

				ELAINE
		What's the matter?

				BEN
		You've got to go over the back
		fence and I'll meet you on the

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - what's happening?

				BEN
		Hurry up.  Put your shoes on.

	Ben turns and looks.

128	SHOT - OVER BEN'S SHOULDER

	Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house.

				BEN
		NO.

	He turns around.

129	NEW ANGLE

	Elaine is standing in the doorway watching him.  She
	still holds the shoe in her hand.

				BEN
		Why aren't you ready?

				ELAINE
		Because I want to know what's
		happening.

	SOUND of Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS in the hall below.

				BEN
		There isn't time!

130	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door.  They stand
	in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though
	they are hiding from someone.  Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS
	can be heard coming up the stairs.

				BEN
		Elaine - I have to tell you
		something.

	He holds her against the wall in the corner.

				ELAINE
		What is it?

				BEN
		That woman -

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		That woman.  The older woman.

				ELAINE
		You mean the one who -

				BEN
		Yes.  The married woman - it
		wasn't just some woman -

	Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the
	hall.

				ELAINE
		What are you telling me?

	The FOOTSTEPS stop.

131	ANGLE - CLOSE ON ELAINE

	Back in the corner.  Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the
	crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder.  Elaine looks from
	Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her
	mother's eyes staring.

				ELAINE
		Please - will somebody tell me -

	She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again.
	Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the
	door.  Elaine looks away.

				ELAINE
		Oh - no.

	Ben backs up.

				BEN
		Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Oh my God -

	Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben
	as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

				BEN
		Please.

	Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room
	then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out
	of her eyes.

				BEN
		No - don't cry -

				ELAINE
		GET OUT!

				BEN
		Don't cry.
			(holds the package
			out to her)

				ELAINE
		Get out of here.

	She moves toward him as though to hit him.  He backs into
	the hall.  Elaine SLAMS the door shut.

				ELAINE
			(holding the door)
		Get out!

132	INT. ROBINSON HALL - DAY

	Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(calmly)
		Goodbye, Benjamin.

133	SHOT - BENJAMIN

	He looks at her in horror.  He starts to back down the
	hall toward the stairs, holding the package against
	his chest.

134	INT. SPECIAL SET - ROBINSON HALL - DAY - SHOT - PULLING
	BACK FROM MRS. ROBINSON

	She is standing there, perfectly calm.  She gets further

	Ben dressed differently, stands by the window overlooking
	the backyard.  Over his shoulder, we can see Mr. Braddock

138	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - DAY

	Ben is standing behind a tree watching the

	starts it.  The car drives down the driveway and down the
	street.

139	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his

	dozen times.  He stops and looks up.

140	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

	It is early morning.  We see a swinging door pushed open
	to reveal:  Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing
	at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can
	see an orange tree.  Mr. Braddock is pouring orange juice
	from a MINUTE MAID container.  Ben stands inside door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Say that again.

				BEN
		I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

	MR. BRADDOCK STARTS TO SMILE.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Well - well - well -

	He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand
	to shake it.  Mrs. Braddock appears in the doorway.  Ben
	is shaking his father's hand.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What's happening?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben says he and Elaine are getting
		married.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		I don't believe it.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		That what he says.  Right?

				BEN
		I'm going up to Berkeley today.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Come on, let's call the Robinsons.
		We've got something to celebrate.

				BEN
		No.  I think you'll want to wait
		on that.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They don't know?

				BEN
		No - they don't.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well - when did you decide all
		this?

				BEN
		About an hour ago.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Wait a minute.  You talked to
		Elaine this morning?

				BEN
		No.  She doesn't know about it.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		She doesn't know that you're
		coming up to Berkeley?

				BEN
		No.  Actually - she doesn't
		know about us getting married
		yet.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		When did you two talk this over?

				BEN
		We haven't.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben - this whole idea sounds
		pretty half-baked.

				BEN
		No - it's not.  It's completely
		baked.  It's a decision I've made.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But what makes you think she
		wants to marry you?

	Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns.

				BEN
		She doesn't.  To be perfectly
		honest, she doesn't like me.

	The Receptionist's hand moves to the receiver of a phone on

		Well - I'm just sort of traveling

	hold it.

	She stops and slowly turns to look in his direction.  Her
	companions also stop.  Ben changes his direction and
	makes a circle to his left as though he has just changed
	his mind.  He looks at her.  He does not stop walking.
	He makes a slow circle around her as he speaks.

		I was wondering where you were

				ELAINE
		I'm meeting someone.

				BEN
		Ah.  Where?

	She doesn't answer.

		Where are you meeting this person?

		No.

				BEN
		Where did he say he was going

		Well, I have this very pleasant

		But you're not enrolled.

				BEN
		No.  I just sit in.  They don't

		Here he comes.

		What?

		I've got a real feeling that

	Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding
	briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH.

				CARL
			(waving)
		Elaine!

				BEN
		He certainly is a good walker.

	Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his
	mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and
	takes Elaine's hands.

				CARL
		Am I late?  I'm sorry.

				BEN
		We thought you said by the

	Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
	Ben smiles.

				ELAINE
		This is Benjamin Braddock.
		Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode

				CARL
		Glad to meet you, Ben.

	Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand.

		Great meeting you, Carl.

	Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder.
	The three of them look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Swell seeing you.  Have a good

	Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl
	and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben
	stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the
	cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back
	at:

177	SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE

	Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand
	gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.

178	SHOT - BEN

	As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears.
	The agony is such that he has to steady himself with
	his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the
	cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They
	look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device
	with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins
	to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

	He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place.
	He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can,
	crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses
	to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and
	takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and
	sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It
	is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the
	bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron.
	He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires
	to straighten it out with the iron.

	There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron
	back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can,
	then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper
	on his lap.

		Come in.

	There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens
	it.  Elaine is standing in the hall.

				ELAINE
		I want to ask you a question.

		No.  I want to know why you're

		Is it because I'm here?

		Well, I want you to leave.

		How could you do that, Benjamin?

	Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm.

				ELAINE
		Do you just hate everything?
		How could you possibly rape
		my...

				BEN
		What?

				ELAINE
		I don't understand -

				BEN
		Did you say rape her?

				ELAINE
		- how you - how anyone - could
		do a thing like that.

				BEN
		What did she say?

				ELAINE
			(holding his arm)
		Let me go.

				BEN
		You've got to tell me what she
		said.

	He touches her hair.

				ELAINE
		Why?

				BEN
		Because it isn't true.

				ELAINE
		I don't feel well.

	Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed.  He kneels
	along side her.

				BEN
		Tell me.

	Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.

				ELAINE
		She said she was having a drink
		in the hotel with a friend.
		You waited for her in the parking
		lot and told her she was too
		drunk to drive home and that
		you would get her a room for
		the night.

				BEN
		Then what?

				ELAINE
		Then you took her upstairs and
		you raped her.

				BEN
		Elaine - that is not what happened.

	She puts her hands on his shoulder.

				ELAINE
		Please let me go.

				BEN
		All right - but listen to me.
		What happened was there was
		this party at my parents.  I
		drove your mother home - then
		we went upstairs to see your
		portrait -

	Elaine tightens her arms around his neck.

				ELAINE
		Don't tell me -

				BEN
		- and when we got up in the
		room she starts taking her her
		clothes off - and -

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - this is my mother!

				BEN
		- suddenly there she was without
		any clothes on - I mean really
		naked -

	Ben is almost lying on top of her.  Elaine screams - a
	long, loud scream.  Ben looks at her.  He leaps off
	the bed and runs to the sink.  He fills a glass with
	water and brings it to Elaine.  He starts toward the
	door.

	SOUND OF FOOTESTEPS on the stairway and in the hall.
	Ben goes to the closet, opens the door, takes a jacket
	from a hanger and puts it on.

	SOUND:  A KNOCK on the door.

				MR. McCLEERY'S VOICE
		What's going on in there?

	Elaine sits up and drinks the water.  Ben looks at
	her then goes to the door and opens it.

				BEN
		Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Who screamed?

				BEN
		It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Screaming isn't all right.  Not
		in my house it isn't.

				BEN
		It was just a visitor.  But it's
		all right now.

	Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see
	into the room.  Ben edges through the door into the
	hallway.

184	INT. ROOMING HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

				MR. McCLEERY
		What did you do to her?

				BEN
		Look - she's all right.  She's
		upset and she screamed.  But
		she's okay now.

				A BOY
		Shall I get the cops?

				BEN
		What?

				A BOY
		I'll get the cops.

	He starts for the stairs.

				BEN
		Hey - wait a minute.  Now damn
		it - look.

	He opens the door a little way.  They all try to see in.

				BEN
		See - she's just having some
		water.  Now there's no need
		for the cops or anything.

				MR. McCLEERY
		All right, boys - I think you
		can get back to your rooms.  I
		don't think we'll have any more
		of this agitation.  Will we,
		Braddock?

				BEN
		No, sir.

	The boys start back to their rooms.  Mr. McCleery and Ben
	stand and look at each other for a few seconds.

				MR. McCLEERY
		I want you out of here.

	Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts
	down the stairs.

				BEN
		Mr. McCleery?

				MR. McCLEERY
		You heard me.  Out of here.

				BEN
		What for?

				MR. McCLEERY
			(going down the
			stairs)
		Because I don't like you.

	Mr. McCleery disappears down the stairs.  Ben turns and
	goes back into the room.

185	INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Elaine is standing at the sink.  She is putting water on
	her face.  Ben goes to the closet and takes out his suit-
	case and carries it to the bed.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry I screamed.

	Ben opens the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin, when you came up here,
		what did you think was going to
		happen between us?

				BEN
		Elaine - right now I don't feel
		like talking much.  I'm sorry
		about everything but I think I'll
		just do this now.

	He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Can I just sit here while you're
		packing?

				BEN
		If you want.

	Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to
	the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them
	in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets
	down on his knees and looks under the bureau.

				ELAINE
		What are you looking for?

				BEN
		My belt.

				ELAINE
		Don't you have it on?

				BEN
		No.  I have two.  The other one
		is the one I'm looking for.
			(he reaches under
			the bureau)
		What's this?
			(he brings out a
			marble)
		It's from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		The marble?

				BEN
		The belt I'm looking for was
		from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		Oh.

	Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it.

				ELAINE
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I don't know.

	He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear
	and carries them to the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Are you going home?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Well - where are you going?

	He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out
	some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the
	suitcase.

				BEN
		Elaine - you're going to have to
		stop asking me that.

	He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to
	the bureau and puts it back in the drawer, takes some
	ties from the drawer and crosses to the suitcase.  Elaine
	gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

				BEN
		I don't understand.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to go anywhere
		until you have a definite plan.

				BEN
		But Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Goodbye.

	She walks out, shutting the door behind her.  He crosses
	to the window.

185A	EXT. ROOMING HOUSE STREET - DAY

		Will you kiss me!

	He goes to her and they kiss.

				BEN
		Will you marry me?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		You won't?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

				BEN
		But you might.

				ELAINE
		I might.

				BEN
		Is that so?  You might marry me?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		When?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

				BEN
		How about tomorrow?  I don't mean
		to be pushy but -

				ELAINE
		I don't know.  I don't know what's
		happening.

				BEN
		You mean you're confused?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well - look - don't be confused.
		We're getting married.

				ELAINE
		I don't see how we can.

				BEN
		We just can.

				ELAINE
		I have to go back now.

	She goes to the door.

				BEN
		Elaine - are you serious about this?

				ELAINE
		I'll think about it.

				BEN
		You really will?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

	She opens the door and steps into the hall.  He goes to the

				BEN
		Why don't I just drag you

				ELAINE
		No, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, what did he say?  I'm curious.

				ELAINE
		He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

				BEN
		Oh no.  He said that.

	She goes through the doorway into Wendell Hall.  Ben remains

	the door opens and Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben,
	kisses him, then runs back inside.  Ben turns and starts
	away from the door.  The door opens again.  Ben turns back

	pause.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(clearing his throat)
		Do you want - do you want to try
		and tell me why you did it?

				BEN
		Mr. Robinson?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you have a special grudge
		against me?  Do you feel a particularly
		strong resentment for me?

				BEN
		No, it's not --

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is there something I've said that's
		caused this contempt?  Or is it just
		the things I stand for that you
		despise?

				BEN
		It was nothing to do with you, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to
		do with me.

	Ben takes a step forward.

				BEN
		Now look - please -

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, I think we're two civilized
		human beings.  Do you think it's
		necessary to threaten each other?

				BEN
		I am not threatening you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you want to unclench your fists,
		please?  Thank you.  I can see in
		the dark, you know.  I've been here
		quite a while.

				BEN
		I am trying to tell you I have no
		personal feelings about you, Mr.
		Robinson.  I am trying to tell
		you I do not resent you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You don't respect me terribly
		much either, do you?

				BEN
		No, I don't.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, I don't think we have a
		whole lot to say to each other,
		Ben.  I do think you should know
		the consequences of what you've
		done.  I do think you should
		know that my wife and I are
		getting a divorce soon.

				BEN
		But why?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Why?

				BEN
		It shouldn't make any difference
		what happened.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's quite a statement.

				BEN
		Listen to me.  We got - we got
		into bed with each other.  But
		it was nothing.  It was nothing
		at all.  We might - we might just
		as well have been shaking hands.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Shaking hands.  Well, that's not
		saying much for my wife, is it?

				BEN
		You miss the point.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Don't shout at me, Ben.

				BEN
		The point is - I don't love your
		wife.  I love your daughter, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well - I'm sure you think you do,
		Ben, but after a few times in
		bed with Elaine I feel quite sure
		you'd get over that as quickly
		as you -

				BEN
		HUH?

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think I've talked about this
		enough.  I don't know how far
		I can go, Ben.  I don't know if
		I can prosecute or not, but I
		think maybe I can.  In the light
		of what's happened I think maybe
		I can get you behind bars if you
		ever look at my daughter again.
		I have seen Elaine and I have
		spent the afternoon taking steps
		to insure...

	Mr. Robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door.
	Ben takes a step toward him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Stay away from me, Ben!

	Mr. Robinson stands at the door.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I don't want to mince words with
		you.  As far as Elaine's concerned
		you're to get her out of your
		filthy mind right now.  Is that
		perfectly clear ro you?  That's
		all, Ben.  You'll pardon me if
		I don't shake hands with you.

	Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are filth.

	Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are scum.

	Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs.  Mr. McCleery is

		Look - I'll give you ten dollars

		Could I make one phone call first?

	is coming through the window.  Ben stops and looks through
	the inside window.  The minister is just closing the book.
	He says something and Carl and Elaine kiss.

				BEN
		Oh, Jesus - God - no -

	He puts his hands up against the glass and slumps.  The
	minister shakes hands with Carl, then takes Elaine's hand.
	The ORGAN music starts to THUNDER.

				BEN
			(straightening)
		No!

	He moves to the center of the window and begins to POUND
	on the glass.

1	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
	SHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV - 

	Moving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can
	see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
	As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
	and PHRASES as though from a public address system.

2	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN

	in cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is
	BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading.

3	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY

	Thousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there.

4	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY

				BEN
		- and today it is right that we
		should ask ourselves the one most
		important question: What is the
		purpose of these years, the purpose
		for all this demanding work,
		the purpose for the sacrifices
		made those who love us?  Were
		there NOT a purpose, then all of
		these past years of struggle, of
		fierce competition and of uncom-
		promising ambition would be mean-
		ingless.  But, of course, there
		is a purpose and I must tell it
		to you.  I ask you to remember
		this purpose always and I pledge
		that I shall endeavor to carry it
		with me forever.

5	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

	staring at him impassively.

6	INTERCUT BETWEEN SHOTS

	of impassive students, seated, watching; of Ben standing
	alone on the huge amphitheatre stage; of CLOSEUPS of Ben
	speaking; of loudspeakers; of wind-blown papers on the
	podium.

7	EXT. PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
			(continuing)
		The purpose, my fellow graduates -

12	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
		- there is a reason, my friends,
		and the reason is - 

13	CLOSEUP - BEN

	He is in a panic.  He looks up from his papers at the audience.

14	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	The audience is gone.

15	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
		- the reason is - the purpose is -

	SOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at
	us through the air.

16	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	Huge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE

		Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
		to begin our descent into Los Angeles -

	SOUND of a SONIC BOOM.

								CUT TO:

17	INT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT

	His eyes open suddenly.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE
		The sound you have just heard is the
		landing gear locking into place.  The
		Los Angeles weather is clear and the
		temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do
		not expect any traffic delay and will
		make our four hour and eighteen minute
		flight plan smack on the nose.  We
		enjoyed having you on board and look
		forward to seeing you again in the near
		future.

18	SHOT

	PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with
	snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the
	ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them.

19	REVERSE ANGLE

	PULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers
	staring straight ahead, their headsets on.  Ben turns and
	looks out the window.

20	EXT. LOS ANGELES - FROM THE AIR - NIGHT

	Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every
	direction.

	SOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH.

	START OF MAIN TITLES

	UNDER titles:

				STEWARDESS' VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your
		seat belts in preparation for the landing
		and observe the no smoking sign.  After
		we land, you will notice an increase in
		the sound level as the thrust of the engines
		is reversed to help reduce forward speed.

21	INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK - NIGHT

	Ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Your attention, please!  American Airlines
		Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop
		to New York is now leaving from Gate
		Number 40.  All aboard, please.

28	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	His eyes are open and he is trying to remember something.
	There are the SOUNDS of many people TALKING and LAUGHING
	in other rooms.  A RADIO nearby PLAYS MUSIC.  After a
	while, there is the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING.  The SOUNDS
	of the people TALKING are lower.  MRS. TERHUNE'S voice
	can be heard among them.

				MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE

		-- associate editor of the college
		newspaper in his junior year - 
		managing editor in his senior
		year -

	The SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
	the VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
	VOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
	remainder of the sequence.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
	being SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
	falls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
	SNAPPED OFF.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What's the matter?

	Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		The guests are all downstairs,
		Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

				BEN
		Look, Dad - could you explain to
		them that I have to be alone for
		a while?

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		These are all our good friends,
		Ben.  Most of them have known you
		since - well - practically since
		you were born.

	Ben has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
	as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What is it, Ben?

	The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

				BEN
		I'm just - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- worried?

				BEN
		Well - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		About what?

				Ben
		I guess - about my future.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		What about it?

				BEN
		I don't know.  I want it to be -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		To be what?

				BEN
			(quietly)
		Different.

	As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
	MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Is anything wrong?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		No!  No - we're just on our way
		downstairs!

	Mr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
	picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Carlsons' are here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to Mrs. Braddock)
		They are?
			(to Ben)
		Come on.

	Mr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They came all the way from
		Tarzana.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		It's a wonderful thing to have
		so many devoted friends.

	They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

29	INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

	PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
	Braddocks are moving down.

				MR. CARLSON
		Hey - there's our award winning
		scholar.

				MRS. CARLSON
		We're all very proud of you,
		Ben.

				BEN
		Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

				MR. CARLSON
		Is that the new car out there?
		The little red Wop job?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		That's Ben's graduation present.

				MR. CARLSON
			(putting his arm
			across Ben's shoulder)
		Won't have much trouble picking
		them up in that, will you?

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. CARLSON
		The girls.  The chicks.  The -
		the teeny boppers.

				MRS. CARLSON
		I think Ben has gotten beyond
		the teeny bopper stage - haven't
		you, Ben?

	Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
	and return the wink politely.

				BEN
		Yes, ma'am.

	They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

				BEN
		Excuse me - I think I'd just
		like to check something on
		the car for a minute -

	Ben moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
	steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Here's the track star himself.
		How are you, track star?

				BEN
		Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

	Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
	hall.

				MR. LOOMIS
		I want to get a drink and then
		I want to hear all about that
		thing you won.  That Hopperman
		award.

				BEN
		Helpingham.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Helpingham!  Right!  Now you
		wait right here.

	Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
	moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
	the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
	lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

				LADY 1
		Ben - we're all so proud of
		you.

				LADY 2
		Proud, proud, proud, proud,
		proud.

				LADY 3
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I was going to go upstairs for a
		minute -

				LADY 3
		No - I meant with your future.

				LADY 2
		With your life.

				BEN
		Well - that's a little hard to say -

	MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben!

				Ben
			(to the ladies)
		Excuse me.
			(he turns around)
		Mr. McQuire

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(overwhelmed with pride)
		Ben.

				BEN
		Mr. McQuire.

	Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
	toward the back of the house and out through the back door.

30	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
	TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben - I just want to say one word to
		you - just one word -

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Are you listening?

				BEN
		Yes I am.

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(gravely)
		Plastics.

	They look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Exactly how do you mean?

				MR. MCQUIRE
		There is a great future in plastics.
		Think about it.  Will you think
		about it?

				BEN
		Yes, I will.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

	Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
	people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

				WOMAN #1
		Here he is now.  Here's Ben.

				BEN
		Excuse me just a minute -

	Ben goes into the house through the back door.

31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his
	way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he
	goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room.

	SOUND of a door SLAMMING.

32	INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the
	PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a
	window, the SOUND of the WIND.

32A	SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location)

	Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door
	OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh.  I guess this isn't the
		bathroom, is it?

				BEN
		It's down the hall.

	They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you, Benjamin?

				BEN
		Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is
		down at the end of the hall.

	Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
	of the bed.

				BEN
		Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
		mean to be rude but -

	Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
	lights it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is there an ashtray in here?

				BEN
		No.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh - I forgot.  The track star
		doesn't smoke.

	She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
	the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
	to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
	wastebasket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it a girl?

				BEN
		Is what a girl?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Whatever it is you're upset
		about.

				BEN
		Oh - no.  I'm just sort of
		disturbed about things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In general.

				BEN
		That's right.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to ask you
		something.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you take me home?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband took the car.  Will
		you drive me home?

	Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
	a set of car keys.

				BEN
		Here - you take it.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him.

				BEN
		Do you know how to work a
		foreign shift?

	Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.

				BEN
		You don't?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.
			(there is a pause)

				BEN
		Let's go.

	She throws the keys to him.  He catches them.

								CUT TO:

	Mr. Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder.  Mrs. Robinson
	is walking ahead through the front door.

	The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway.  They sit

	and opens the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you come in, please?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want you to come in till I get
		the lights on.

				BEN
		What for?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't feel safe until
		I get the lights on.

	They move to the door.  She takes out her key and opens
	the door.

36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you mind walking ahead of
		me to the sun porch.  I feel
		funny about coming into a dark
		house.

				BEN
		But it's light in there now.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please.

	Ben turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?  Bourbon?

				BEN
		Look - I drove you home.  I was
		glad to do it.  But I have some
		things on my mind.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		All right then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?

	He looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
		way, but I don't want to be
		alone in this house.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please wait till my husband
		gets home.

				BEN
		When is he coming back?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't know.

	She pours herself a drink.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drink?

				BEN
		No.

	She hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

				BEN
		Are you always this much afraid
		of being alone?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, why can't you just lock
		the doors and go to bed?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'm very nuerotic.

	She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I ask you a question?

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you think of me?

				BEN
		What do you mean?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You've known me nearly all of
		your life.  You must have
		formed some opinion.

				BEN
		Well - I've always thought
		that you were a very - nice -
		person.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know I was an alcoholic?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know that?

				BEN
		Look - I think I should be
		going -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
		mind my saying so - this
		conversation is getting a
		little strange.  Now I'm sure
		that Mr. Robinson will be here
		any minute and -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband will be back quite
		late.

	They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He should be gone for several
		hours.

	She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
	retreats around the other side of the chair.

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Pardon?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What's wrong?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
		I mean you didn't expect -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean - you didn't really
		think that I would do something
		like that.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Like what?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I don't know.

				BEN
		For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
		here we are, you've got me into
		your house.  You give me a
		drink.  You put on music, now
		you start opening up your
		personal life to me and tell
		me your husband won't be home
		for hours.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		So?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
		to seduce me.

	There is a pause.  She looks at him.

				BEN
			(weaker)
		Aren't you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.
		I feel rather flattered that
		you -

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
		me for what I just said?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's all right.

				BEN
		It's not all right, it's the
		worst thing I've ever said
		to anyone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down.

				BEN
		Please forgive me.  Because I
		like you.  I don't think of you
		that way.  But I'm mixed up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now finish your drink.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
		that I said that to you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'll forget it right now.
		Finish your drink.

				BEN
		What is wrong with me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you ever seen Elaine's
		portrait?

				BEN
		Her portrait?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We had it done last Christmas.
		Would you like to see it?

				BEN
		Very much.

	We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
	into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
	the doorway to Elaine's room.

37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

				BEN
		Elaine certainly is an
		attractive girl, isn't she?

	In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

				BEN
			(looking at the
			portrait)
		I don't remember her as having
		brown eyes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you unzip my dress?

	He steps back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I think I'll go to bed.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, goodnight.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Won't you unzip my dress?

				BEN
		I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you still think I'm trying
		to seduce you -

				BEN
		No, I don't.  But I just feel
		a little funny.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - you've known me all
		your life.

				BEN
		I know that.  But I'm -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Come on.

	She turns her back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's hard for me to reach.

	Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	Ben walks toward the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What are you so scared of?

				BEN
		I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then why do you keep running
		away?

				BEN
		Because you're going to bed.  I
		don't think I should be up here.

	Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Haven't you ever seen anybody
		in a slip before?

				BEN
		Yes, I have -

	He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

				BEN
		But I just - Look - what if Mr.
		Robinson walked in right now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What if he did?

				BEN
		Well, it would look pretty
		funny, wouldn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you think he trusts us
		together?

				BEN
		Of course he does.  But he
		might get the wrong idea.
		Anyone might.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't see why.  I'm twice as
		old as you are.  How could
		anyone think -

				BEN
		But they would!  Don't you see?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm not trying to
		seduce you.  I wish you'd -

				BEN
		I know that.  But please, Mrs.
		Robinson.  This is difficult
		for me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why is it?

				BEN
		Because I am confused about
		things.  I can't tell what
		I'm imagining.  I can't tell
		what's real.  I can't -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you like me to seduce you?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is that what you're trying to
		tell me?

				BEN
		I'm going home now.  I apologize
		for what I said.  I hope you can
		forget it.  But I'm going home
		right now.

	Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
	CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
	stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
	the stairs and starts down.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		BENJAMIN?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring up my purse before
		you go?

				BEN
		I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

	Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall.  Her back is to us.
	She is holding her dress in front of her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I really don't want to put this
		on again.  Won't you bring it
		up?

				BEN
		Where is it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On that chair in the hall.

	She walks out of the shot.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BEN
		Well here's the purse.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Could you bring it up?

				BEN
		Well I'll hand it to you.

	Ben starts back up the stairs.

				BEN
		Come to the railing and I'll
		hand it up.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin - I am getting pretty
		tired of all this suspicion.
		Now if you won't do me a simple
		favor I don't know what.

	Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

				BEN
		I'm putting it on the top step.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		For God's sake, Benjamin, will
		you stop acting that way and
		bring me the purse?

	Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
	down the hall.

				BEN
		I'm putting it here by the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring it in to me?

				BEN
		I'd rather not.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		All right.  Put it in the room
		where we were.

				BEN
		Right.

38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
	bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
	back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
	movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
	turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
	door to the bedroom behind her.

				BEN
		Oh God.

	She smiles.

				BEN
		Let me out.

	She turns the lock on the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't be nervous.

				BEN
		Get away from that door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want to say something first.

				BEN
		Jesus Christ!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I want you to know
		I'm available to you.  If you
		won't sleep with me this time -

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you won't sleep with me this
		time, Benjamin, I want you to
		know you can call me up any
		time you want and we'll make
		some kind of arrangement.

				BEN
		Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand what I said?

				BEN
		Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I find you very attractive
		and any time -

	There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
	Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
	struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
	the hall and down the stairs.

39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT

	Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of
	FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets
	the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
	SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Is that Ben's car in front?

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		Yes, sir!

	FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters.

				BEN
		I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson
		home.  She wanted me to drive
		her home so I - I drove her home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Swell.  I appreciate it.

				BEN
		She's upstairs.  She wanted me
		to wait down here till you got
		home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Standing guard over the old
		castle, are you?

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

	Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Here.  It looks like you need
		a refill.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I've got to go.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is anything wrong?  You look
		a little shaken up.

				BEN
		No.  No - I'm just - I'm just
		a little worried about my
		future.  I'm a little upset
		about my future.

	Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Come on.  Let's have a nightcap
		together.

	Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
	Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
	and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
	turns and brings him the drink.

				BEN
		Thank you very much, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - how old are you now?

				BEN
		Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one
		next week.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(taking out a
			cigarette)
		That's a hell of a good age
		to be.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I wish I was that age again.
		Because, Ben -

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. ROBINSON
		You'll never be young again.

				BEN
		I know.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, can I say something to
		you?

				BEN
		What?

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have we known each
		other now?

	Ben shakes his head.

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have you and I known
		each other?  How long have
		your Dad and I been partners?

				BEN
		Quite a while.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I've watched you grow up, Ben.

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		In many ways I feel as though
		you were my own son.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		So I hope you won't mind my
		giving you a friendly piece
		of advice.

				BEN
		I'd like to hear it.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I think - I think you
		ought to be taking it a little
		easier right now than you seem
		to.

	Ben nods.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Sow a few wild oats.  Take things
		as they come.  Have a good time
		with the girls and so forth.

	Mrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the
	dress she wore earlier.  Ben starts to get up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't get up.

	Ben sits.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I was just telling Ben here he
		ought to sow a few wild oats.
		Have a good time while he can.
		You think that's sound advice?

	Mrs. Robinson nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I do.

				BEN
		I've got to go.

	He stands.  Mr. Robinson stands up with him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You have yourself a few flings
		this summer.  I bet you're
		quite a ladies' man.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?  You look like the kind
		of guy that has to fight them
		off.
			(to Mrs. Robinson)
		Doesn't he look to you like
		the kind of guy who has to
		fight them off?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, he does.

	They start out of the sunroom.

40	INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT

				MR. ROBINSON
		Oh say - Elaine gets down from
		Berkeley on Saturday.

				BEN
		Oh yes.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I want you to give her a
		call.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Great.

	Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.

41	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house.  Ben comes toward
	the car.  Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light
	behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you for taking me home.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll see you soon, I hope.

	Ben continues to walk toward us.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen - your
		attention, please - for this after-
		noon's feature attraction.

								CUT TO:

42	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
	the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
	and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
	LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
	fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
	door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
	side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
	as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
	ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
	Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
	Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
	too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
	old for them.

	Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
	house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
	end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Hey, over there -- I mean you!
		Your attention please!

	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
	house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
	in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Are you ready in there, feature
		attraction?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Could I speak to you for a second,
		Dad?

	But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
	and is readdressing his audience.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- what was I saying?

				MRS. ARNOLD
		Feature attraction.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see
		you're paying attention.  A
		feature attraction that will be
		one of the most astounding
		events ever to take place in
		this particular backyard.

	They all laugh and some applaud.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Now I'm going to ask for a big
		round of applause to bring this
		boy out here - wait a minute -
		let me amend that - to bring
		this young man out here - because
		today he is twenty-one-years-
		old -

				MR. ARNOLD
			(his hands like
			a megaphone)
		Let's get on with the show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Just hang on a minute because
		I have a few words to say -

				MR. ARNOLD
		You always do.

	They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
	he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
	comeback.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - could we just talk about
		this for a second?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Twenty-one-years-old, ladies
		and gentlemen; four of those
		years spent accomplishing some
		rather extraordinary things at
		one of our nation's leading
		seats of learning -

				MR. ARNOLD
		Bring him out!

				PETER AND LOUISE
		On with the show!  On with the
		show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to the window)
		I can't hold them much longer,
		Ben.  You better get out here.

				BEN'S VOICE
		I'd like to discuss this.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to his audience)
		This boy - I'm sorry - this
		young man - is soon to continue
		his education as a Frank Halping-
		ham Award Scholar - but before
		he does -

	Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- before he does -
			(to the window)
		You're disappointing them, Ben.
		You're disappointing them.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - can you listen -

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(meaning it)
		I'll give you ten seconds.
			(back to the
			people)
		He is going to give us a
		practical demonstration of
		what I feel safe in saying is
		a pretty exciting birthday
		present - and it better work
		or I'm out over two hundred
		bucks - so let's hear it for -

	Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
	It slams against the wall inside.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- Benjamin Braddock!

44	INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY

	At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
	dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
	on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
	mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
	He holds a spear gun in his hand.

	The people applaud.

45	EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV

	The people in the backyard.  His father stands just
	outside the screen door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Folks - this remarkable young
		man is going to perform for you
		some spectacular and amazing
		feats of daring in water that is
		over six feet deep -

	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
	down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
	the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
	apparatus in it.

	SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
	SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
	applauding and chattering noiselessly.

	We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
	is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
	delivering his now soundless pitch.

	We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
	pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
	motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
	joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
	begin to motion us toward them.

	We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
	us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
	of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
	under.  He has a big smile.

	We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
	figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
	of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
	the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
	fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
	encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
	smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
	under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)

	Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at
	the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking
	down into it.

	PULL UP AND UP AND UP

	Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,
	swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing,
	sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools.
	SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
	of the WIND.

	Hold for a few seconds, then:

	SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

								DISSOLVE TO:

47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
	the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds
	the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite
		know how to put this -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Look - I was thinking about that
		time after the party -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		- and I was wondering if I could
		buy you a drink or something -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		Uh - The Taft Hotel.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Did you get a room?

				BEN
		No.  Now I know it's pretty
		late and if you'd rather -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Give me an hour.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'll be there in an hour.

	SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
	uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
	carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
	leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
	lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
	doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
	out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
	to each other and helping each other out of the door and
	down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
	and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
	Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
	PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
	him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
	moves back against the other door, holding it open and
	allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
	pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
	lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
	them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
	and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

	The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
	him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
	where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
	and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
	looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
	the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
	keys dangling suggestively.

				ROOM CLERK
		Can I help you, sir!

				BEN
		What?  Oh - no - I'm just -

	He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
	people.

				ROOM CLERK
		Are you here for an affair,
		sir?

	Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
	helplessly at the clerk.

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		The Singleman party, sir?

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.

				ROOM CLERK
		It's in the main ballroom.

				BEN
		Ahh - thank you.

	Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
	He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
	to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

	What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
	He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

	What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
	him.

	Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
	as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
	affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

48	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	As Ben steps inside.

				VOICE
		Hello.

	Ben turns.  Four people stand in a row.  Official greeters,
	they are:  A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY
	LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they
	are smiling with great determination.

				BEN
		Hello.

	It is the older lady who has said hello.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		You must be one of the Porters.

	She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm not -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'd like you to know my sister,
		Miss DeWitte -

	MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has
	been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.

				MISS DeWITTE
		How do you do?

				BEN
		How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

	Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's
	hand.

				BEN
			(apologetically)
		Oh - sorry -

				JEFFREY SINGLEMAN
		Fine, thank you.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		That's Jeffrey, of course.

	Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand.

				BEN
		Of course.

				MR. SINGLEMAN
		I didn't get your name, sir.

				BEN
		Benjamin Braddock, sir.

	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been
	holding.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Braddock - Braddock?

				BEN
		Yes, but I'm afraid -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'll find your table in a moment.
		Braddock.  Not Braniff?  We have
		a Braniff.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm just looking
		for a friend.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'm afraid I don't understand.

				BEN
			(backing off)
		I'm not with your party - I'm
		sorry.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Hey - I don't get it.

	Ben is backing out.

				MISS DeWITTE
		I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr.
		Braniff.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Angela - please!

	Ben backs out of the ballroom.

49	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben crosses the lobby, passing PEOPLE going in and out of
	the hotel.  He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room:

50	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the
	windows that look out over the hotel grounds.  It is quite
	dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen
	people seated around.

	The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room
	and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table
	by the window.

	PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

	In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson.
	She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts
	toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does
	not see her approach.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh.  Hello.  Hello.

	He rises quickly.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I sit down?

				BEN
		Of course.

	He pulls out a chair, for her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	They sit down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you?

				BEN
		Very well.  Thank you.

	Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down
	at the center of the table.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I have a drink?

				BEN
		A drink?  Of course.

	Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.
	The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs.
	Robinson apologetically.

				BEN
		He didn't see me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Waiter!

	For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The
	waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter
	moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back.
	The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I will have a martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Yes, madam.

	The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to be so nervous,
		you know.

				BEN
		Nervous.  Well, I am a bit
		nervous.  I mean it's - it's
		pretty hard to be suave when
		you're -

	He shakes his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you get us a room?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you gotten us a room yet?

				BEN
		I haven't.  No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to?

				BEN
		Well - I don't.  I mean I could.
		Or we could just talk.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want me to get it?

				BEN
		You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to get it now?

				BEN
		Now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I don't know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you get it.

				BEN
		Why don't I get it?  Well -
		I will then.
			(he stands up)
		If you'll excuse me.

	Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

55	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.

				ROOM CLERK
		Yes sir?

				BEN
		A room.  I'd like a room,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		A single room or a double
		room?

				BEN
		A single.  Just for myself,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		Will you sign the register,
		please?

	He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his
	name on the card and then stares at it for a moment,
	crumples it up and fills out a second card.

				ROOM CLERK
		Is anything wrong, sir?

				BEN
		What?  No.  Nothing.

				ROOM CLERK
			(taking a key from
			behind the counter)
		Do you have any luggage, Mister --
			(looks at registration
			card)
		Gladstone?

				BEN
		Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is it?

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is your luggage?

				BEN
		Well it's in the car.  It's
		out in the car.

				ROOM CLERK
		Very good, sir.  I'll have a
		porter bring it in.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				ROOM CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		I mean I'd - I'd rather not
		go to the trouble of bringing
		it all in.  I just have a
		toothbrush.  I can get it my-
		self.  If that's all right.

				ROOM CLERK
		Of course.

	Ben reaches for the key.

				ROOM CLERK
		I'll have a porter show you the
		room.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as
		soon find it myself.  I just have
		the toothbrush to carry up and
		I think I can manage it myself.

				ROOM CLERK
		Whatever you say, sir.

	He hands Ben the key.

				BEN
		Thank you.

56	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays
	absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips
	her martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Mrs. Robinson.

	She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table
	with a telephone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

	The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to
	the table and hands her the receiver.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	The waiter nods and leaves.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(into phone)
		Hello.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		It's Benjamin.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Benjamin Braddock.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin -- where are you?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you look through the glass.

	Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the
	glass into the lobby.

57	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES

	Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty
	feet away.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you see me now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I can.

58	INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH

	Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the
	glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in
	the Veranda Room.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

				BEN
		I got a single room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's fine.

				BEN
		But there's one thing.  The desk clerk
		seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
		I mean - I don't know what their policy
		is - but -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well - do you want to go up first?

				BEN
		Yes - I think that would be good.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll be up in five minutes.

				BEN
		Well - goodbye then -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Isn't there something you want to
		tell me?

				BEN
		To tell you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I want you to know how much
		I appreciate this - really -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The number.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The room number, Benjamin.  I think
		you ought to tell me that.

				BEN
		Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.
		It's 512.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you
		later, Mrs. Robinson.

	He hangs up.

59	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - SHOT - BEN

	He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby.

60	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts
	to pat his breast pocket.

				BEN
		I've got it.

	The desk clerk looks up.

				BEN
		I say I've got it.

				CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		The toothbrush.  I got it all right.

				CLERK
		Very good, sir.

				BEN
		Yes.  Well - goodnight.

				CLERK
		Goodnight, sir.

	Ben walks out of shot.

60A	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and
	opens door.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against
	it for a few moments looking at the room.  The only light
	is that coming in the window.  Ben turns on the light switch
	on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light
	from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch
	off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on
	the light.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area
	through the window.  Ben closes the blinds.

61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and
	opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her
	purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the
	mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room,
	finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

	He clears his throat and then he kisses her.

				BEN
		Well.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll get undressed now.  Is that all
		right?

				BEN
		Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just
		stand here?  I mean - I don't know
		what you want me to do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you watch?

				BEN
		Oh - sure.  Thank you.

	She takes off her jacket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you bring me a hanger?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		A hanger.

	Ben opens the closet door.

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  Wood?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Wood or wire?  They have both.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Either one will be fine.

				BEN
		Okay.

	He brings her a hanger.  She puts her jacket on it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you help me with this,
		please?

	She turns her back.

				BEN
		Certainly.

	He undoes the zipper at her neck.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.

	She turns and looks at him.  He backs away.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would this be easier for you
		in the dark?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I can't do
		this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You what?

				BEN
		This is all terribly wrong.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -
		I think you're the most attractive
		of all my parents' friends.
		I just don't think we could
		possibly --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you afraid of me?

				BEN
		No - but look - maybe we could
		do something else together,
		Mrs. Robinson - would you like
		to go to a movie.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, is this your first time?

				BEN
		Is this - what?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It is, isn't it?  It is your
		first time.

				BEN
		That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
		That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You can admit that, can't you?

				BEN
		Are you kidding?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's nothing to be ashamed of -

				BEN
		Wait a minute!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On your first time -

				BEN
		Who said it was my first time.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That you're afraid -

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		 - of bring - inadequate -  I mean
		just because you happen to be
		inadequate in one way - 

				BEN
		INADEQUATE!

	LONG pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(starting to dress)

				BEN
		Don't move.

	He slams the bathroom door shut.  The light in the room
	disappears.

62	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool
	and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the
	pool.  Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds
	a beer can in one hand.

66	WHAT HE SEES

	Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire.  Mrs.
	Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some
	ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.

67	SHOT - BEN

	He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool.  He
	climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a
	chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and
	goes through.

68	INT. SPECIAL SET - TAFT HOTEL ROOM

	Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.  He
	is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.

	PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson
	who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace-
	let and watch.  He moves to a chair and sits.

	He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next
	to the chair.  Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in
	front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt.

	He takes the cigarette out of his mouth.

	SHOT - NEW ANGLE

	We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock

	to the door to the den and shuts it.

70	INT. BRADDOCK DEN - NIGHT - REVERSE

	stand facing the bed.

	SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern.

	PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light
	from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot,
	half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television
	set and goes out of frame.  Ben continues to stare at the set.

	SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up.

	Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way.

	SOUND of BRACELETS being put on.

	Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

	SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped

				BEN

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Why?

				BEN
		Well - it's very comfortable -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Have you thought about graduate
		school?

				BEN
		No.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Would you  mind telling me then -
		what were those four years of
		college for?  What was the point
		of all that hard work?

				BEN
		You got me.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(trying unsuccessfully
			to control himself)
		Now listen, Ben.  I think it's
		a very good thing that a young
		man - after he's done some very
		good work - should have a chance
		to relax and enjoy himself, and
		lie around, and drink beer and
		so on.  But after a few weeks
		I believe that person would
		want to take some stock in him-
		self and his situation and start
		to think about getting off his
		ass.

	Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Robinson's are here.

	Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out
	the sun.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with
		yourself these days?

				BEN
		Oh - not too much.  Taking it
		easy.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's what I'd do if I could.
		Nothing wrong with that.  Hey
		Ben, Elaine's coming down from
		Berkeley soon.  I want you to
		call her up this time.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Because I just think you two
		would hit it off real well

		Can I talk to you a minute?

				BEN
		Sure.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you
		something but you don't have to
		tell me if you don't want.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well I'm going to ask you what

				BEN
		When I go off?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		You don't have to tell me if

				BEN
		No, I do.  I want to tell you.

	There is a pause.

				BEN
		I drive around.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What else?

				BEN
		Nothing else.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well you don't drive around from

				BEN
		Oh, no.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Then what do you do?  Do you

				BEN
		Meet someone?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well this is your business,
		Benjamin.
			(she starts toward
			the door)
		If you -

				BEN
		No wait.  Wait.

	She stops.

				BEN
		I don't meet anyone, mother, but
		why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin, I'm not going to pry
		into your affairs, but I'd
		rather you didn't say anything
		at all than be dishonest.
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, wait.

	She looks at him.

				BEN
		You think I'm being dishonest?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well why do you - why do you
		think that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Because I know you don't drive
		around for twelve hours.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
		tell you what I do?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Not if you don't want to.

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But I don't want you to make
		up something.

				BEN
		I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
		proud of what I do.  I usually
		get kind of drunk.  I usually
		drive over to Los Angeles and
		go to some bars and get kind of
		drunk.  Then I take a hotel
		room.  So I won't have to drive
		home on the freeway.  I mean it
		kind of scares me to drive home
		after - 

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		You believe me, don't you?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		No.

				BEN
		You don't?

	She shakes her head.

	Mrs. Robinson's hands are undoing his necktie.  Ben is

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

		Sit down a minute.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.

				BEN
		Will you please sit down a

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches
	down to take off a shoe.

				BEN
		Will you leave that shoe on for
		a minute.  Please.

	She straightens up.

				BEN
		Now - do you think we could say
		a few words to each other first
		this time?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you want.

				BEN
		Good.  I mean are we dead or
		something?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I just don't think we have
		much to say to each other.

				BEN
		All we ever do is come up here
		and throw off the clothes and
		leap into bed together.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you tired of it?

				BEN
		I'm not.  No.  But do you think
		we could liven it up with a
		few words now and then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well what do you want to talk

				BEN
		Anything.  Anything at all.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to tell me about

				BEN
		Oh my God.

		Well?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best

	She reaches for her shoe.

				BEN
		Leave it on!  Now we are going to
		do this thing.  We are going to
		have a conversation.  Think of
		another topic.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How about art.

				BEN
		Art.  That's a good subject.
		You start it off.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You start it off.  I don't know
		anything about it.

				BEN
		Oh.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you?

				BEN
		Yes I do.  I know quite a bit
		about it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go ahead then.

				BEN
		Art.  Well what do you want to
		know about it.

	She shrugs.

				BEN
		Are you interested more in modern
		art or more in classical art.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Neither.

				BEN
		You're not interested in art?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Then why do you want to talk
		about it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

	Ben nods and looks at the rug.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I take off my clothes now?

				BEN
		No.  Think of another topic.
		Tell me what you did today.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you really want me to?

				BEN
		Yes I do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.

	Ben starts shaking his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to hear it or not?

				BEN
		Yes.  But you might try and spice
		it up with a little originality.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.  I ate breakfast and
		went shopping.  During the after-
		noon I read a novel.

				BEN
		What one.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		What novel did you read.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't remember.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then I fixed supper for my husband
		and waited until -

				BEN
		There!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
		There's something we could have
		a conversation about.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Him?

				BEN
		I mean everything.  I don't know
		anything about how you - how you
		work this.  I don't know how you
		get out of the house at night.  I
		don't know the risk involved.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There isn't any.

				BEN
		There's no risk?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		How do you get out of the house?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I walk out.

				BEN
		You walk right out the door.

	She nods.

				BEN
		What do you say to him?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He's asleep.

				BEN
		Always?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, this isn't a very
		interesting topic.

				BEN
		Please.  Now tell me.  How do
		you know he won't wake up
		sometime and follow you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because he takes sleeping pills.
		He takes three sleeping pills
		every night at ten o'clock.

				BEN
		But what about the noise from
		the car.  What if -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The driveway's on my side of
		the house.

				BEN
			(smiling)
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Calm down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Now let's keep going here.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I undress and talk at the
		same time?

				BEN
		Right.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Now.  You say the driveway's on
		your side of the house.  So I
		guess you don't sleep in the
		same room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We don't.

				BEN
		So you don't - I mean I don't
		like to seem like I'm prying
		but I guess you don't sleep
		together or anything.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No we don't.

				BEN
		Well how long has this been going
		on.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at the
			ceiling for a moment)
		About five years.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		You have not slept with your
		husband for five years?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Now and then.  He geats drunk a
		few times a year.

				BEN
		How many times a year.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
		his birthday.

				BEN
		Man, is this interesting.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		So you don't love him.  You
		wouldn't say you -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We've talked enough, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't
		say you loved him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not exactly.

				BEN
		But you don't hate him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
		Unhook my blouse.

				BEN
			(unhooking her blouse)
		Well how do you feel about him,
		then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

				BEN
		Well that's kind of a bad
		situation then, isn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		I mean it doesn't sound like it
		could be much worse.  If you
		hated him at least you'd hate
		him.

	She nods and takes off her blouse.

				BEN
		Well you loved him once, I
		assume.  When you first knew
		him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I never did, Benjamin.  Now
		let's -

				BEN
		Well, wait a minute.  You married
		him.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you do that?

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(taking off her
			stockings)
		See if you can guess.

				BEN
		Well I can't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Think real hard, Benjamin.

				BEN
		I can't see why you did, unless
		...you didn't have to marry him
		or anything, did you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't tell Elaine.

				BEN
		Oh no.  You had to marry him
		because you got pregnant?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you shocked?

				BEN
		Well I never thought of you and
		Mr. Robinson as the kind of
		people who...

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now let's get to bed.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
		So how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean do you feel like telling
		me what were the circumstances?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not particularly.

				BEN
		Was he a law student at the time?

	She nods.

				BEN
		And you were a student also.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		At college.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		What was your major?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why are you asking me all this?

				BEN
		Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
		Now what was your major subject
		at college?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Art.

				BEN
		Art?

	She nods.

				BEN
		But I thought you - I guess you
		kind of lost interest in it over
		the years then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Kind of.

				BEN
		Well how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How do you think.

				BEN
		I mean did he take you up to
		his room with him?  Did you go
		to a hotel?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, what does it possibly
		matter?

				BEN
		I'm curious.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'd go to his car.

				BEN
		Oh no.  In the car you did it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't think we were the first.

	Ben thinks for a moment.

				BEN
		What kind of car was it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Do you remember the make of the
		car?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh my God.

				BEN
		Really.  I want to know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It was a Ford, Benjamin.

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
		Ford!  That's great!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's enough.

				BEN
		So old Elaine Robinson got started
		in a Ford.

	There is a pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't talk about Elaine.

				BEN
		Don't talk about Elaine?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't want you to.

	She walks to the bed.

				BEN
		Well why don't you?

	She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
	jacket.

				BEN
		I wish you'd tell me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There's nothing to tell.

				BEN
		Well why is she a big taboo
		subject all of a sudden?

	Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

				BEN
		Well - I guess I'll have to ask
		her out on a date and find out
		what's --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, don't you ever take
		that girl out.

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand that?

				BEN
		Well look.  I have no intention
		of taking her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		I was just kidding around.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		But why shouldn't I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I have my reasons.

				BEN
		Then let's hear them.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
		Robinson.  Because I think I
		know what they are.

	She pulls the covers down.

				BEN
		I'm not good enough for her to
		associate with, am I?  I'm not
		good enough to even talk about
		her, am I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Let's drop it.

				BEN
		We're not dropping it.  Now
		that's the reason, isn't it?
		I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
		I?  I'm not fit to -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		I'm good enough for you but I'm
		too slimy to associate with
		your daughter.  That's it, isn't
		it?  ISN'T IT?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		You go to hell.  You go straight
		to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
		think I'm proud of myself?  Do
		you think I'm proud of this?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I wouldn't know.

				BEN
		Well, I'm not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You're not.

				BEN
		No sir.  I am not proud that I
		spend my time with a broken-
		down alcoholic!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I see.

				BEN
		And if you think I come here
		for any reason besides pure
		boredom, then you're all wrong.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Because - Mrs. Robinson this
		is the sickest, most perverted
		thing that ever happened to
		me.  And you do what you want
		but I'm getting the hell out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you?

				BEN
		You're goddamn right I am.

	He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
	the bed and watches him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's how you feel about me.

	He nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That I'm a sick and disgusting
		person.

				BEN
		Now don't start this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Don't start acting hurt.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you expect me to be a
		little hurt?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
		and tell me I'm not good enough
		for your daughter.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did I say that?

				BEN
		Of course you did.

	She shakes her head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to apologize
		to you if that's the impression
		you got.

				BEN
		Well two minutes ago you told
		me I wasn't good enough for
		your daughter.  Now you say
		you're sorry I got that
		impression.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I didn't mean it.  I don't think
		you'd be right for each other.
		But I would never say you
		weren't as good a person as
		she is.

				BEN
		You wouldn't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Of course I wouldn't.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

				BEN
		What are you doing?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well it's pretty obvious you
		don't want me around any more.

				BEN
		Well look - I was kind of upset
		there.  I'm sorry I said those
		things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If that's how you feel -

				BEN
		But it's not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(smiling at him)
		That's all right.  I think I
		can understand why I'm disgusting
		to you.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I
		wouldn't keep coming here if
		I didn't like you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But if it's sickening for you -

				BEN
		It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
		forward to it.  It's the one
		thing I have to look forward
		to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to say that.

				BEN
		Well I wouldn't.  I would never
		say it if it wasn't true.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I stay then?

				BEN
		Yes. Please.  I want you to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Well don't thank me, because I
		want you to.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But you won't ever take out
		Elaine, will you?  I want you
		to promise me that.

	There is another long pause.

				BEN
		Look.  Why the hell did you
		bring this up.  It never
		occured to me to take her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then give me your word you won't.

				BEN
		This is absurd.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Promise me, Benjamin.

				BEN
		All right, for christ's sake.
		I promise I will never take
		out Elaine Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.
			(pause)
		Benjamin -

				BEN
		Let's not talk about it.  Let's
		not talk at all.

	At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each
	other, they begin to take off their clothes.

								FADE OUT

	FADE IN

92	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

	Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking
	at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
	are there.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Elaine's back from school.  I
		think it might be a nice gesture
		if you asked her out.

	Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
	eating and reading.

								CUT TO:

93	INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the
	doorway.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't you think that she's a
		terribly attractive girl?
		Because I think she's one of
		the prettiest girls I've
		ever seen.

	Ben gives a small whimper.

								CUT TO:

94	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
	Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
	is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
	down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
	in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
	Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to
	swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
	their heads above the surface.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		It's pretty embarrassing.  I
		really don't know what to tell
		Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward
		and strained for me every time
		he suggests that you call up
		Elaine.

				BEN
		Next time he suggests it,
		I'll tell him I have no
		intention of ever calling
		her up in my life.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess she's not good enough
		for you, is that it?

				BEN
		Look - Elaine Robinson and I
		do not get along.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		How do you know?  You haven't
		seen her since high school.  I
		guess your evenings, whatever
		you do with them, are just too
		valuable.

				BEN
		That has nothing to do with it -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
		that you're just too busy every
		evening - doing God knows what -

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't go on like this.  Now if
		Benjamin absolutely refuses to
		take her out -

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		- then I'll simply invite all the
		Robinsons' over for dinner on
		Thursday.

95	SHOT - BEN

	He slides off the raft and goes underwater.

96	SHOT - BEN UNDERWATER

	His hair streaming up, his eyes open.

							CUT TO:

97	INT. SPECIAL SET BRADDOCK DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a
	table for two are seated, jammed in against each other,
	the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
	back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
	facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
	the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
	eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
	Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
	continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
	Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

							CUT TO:

98	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the
	pool.

				BEN
		I'll go call Elaine now.

	Mr. and Mrs. Braddock cling exhausted to the raft and
	try to smile at each other.

	SOUND:  Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes.

							CUT TO:

99	EXT. & INT. ROBINSON FRONT DOOR, HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

	The door opens.  Mr. Robinson stands there with a huge
	smile.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Braddock - it's about
		time you got around to this.
		Come on in.  I'm afraid the
		young lady isn't quite ready
		yet -

	Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.  Mrs. Robinson is
	sitting there.

				BEN
		Hello.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What would you say to a short one?
		Bourbon still your drink?

				BEN
		Yes.

	Mr. Robinson hands him drink.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I'll see if she's ready.

	Mr. Robinson exits.

100	SHOT - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

		about it, Benjamin.

	Mr. Robinson and ELAINE enter.

				ELAINE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Hello.

101	CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Well - I want you to keep your
		wits about you tonight.  You never
		know what tricks Ben picked up
		back there in the East.

							LAP DISSOLVE TO:

102	EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

	SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE in Ben's car.  From the back.  Ben
	leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in
	and out of the traffic.  Ben is wearing dark glasses.

				ELAINE
		You're living at home now.  Is
		that right?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		Do you know what you're going
		to do?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Are you going to graduate school?

				BEN
		No.

	He leans on the HORN.  The car directly ahead of him
	does not move to the right.  Ben jerks his car over to the
	right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn
	down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the
	driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him.
	Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.

				ELAINE
		Do you always drive like this?

				BEN
		Yes.

								CUT TO:

103	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	A drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed WAITERS.
	Ben and Elaine are seated at a table.

				BEN
		Do you want some dinner?

				ELAINE
		I'd love some.

	A waiter moves forward toward them.

				BEN
		Bring a menu.

				WAITER #2
		Dinner for two, sir?

				BEN
		No.  Just for her.

	The waiter moves away.

				ELAINE
		Aren't you eating?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Why not?

				BEN
		If it's all right with you,
		I'm not hungry.

	The waiter returns with a menu.

				ELAINE
		I've changed my mind.  Thank
		you.

								CUT TO:

104	EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - SHOTS

	Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.

105	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the
	entrance.  Without turning around, he waits for Elaine
	who has difficulty following him.  As she gets to him,
	he starts forward again.  He starts up the stairs.
	Elaine is just behind him.

								CUT TO:

106	INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled.  A tuxedoed HOOD leads
	them through the tables to a table directly under the stage
	on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her
	dress.  There is one chair facing the stage, the other with
	its back to and up against the stage.  Ben sits down in
	the chair facing the stage.  Elaine stands for a moment,
	unsure.

				BEN
		Sit down.

	Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage.
	She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
	Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and
	puts them on.  The two chairs are slightly angled toward
	each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without
	looking directly at Elaine.

				BEN
		Why don't you watch the show?

	The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - do you dislike me
		for some reason?

				BEN
		No - why should I?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

107	SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER

	She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.  She is
	twirling the tassels.

				BEN
		You're missing a great effect
		here.

	Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns
	back.

				BEN
		How do you like that?

	Elaine doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Could you do it?

				ELAINE
		No.

	The stripper sees Elaine look.  The stripper smiles toward
	Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she
	walks.  Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.

	The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair.  The
	spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's
	face.  As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield
	her eyes.

	The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it
	and holds it up in the air.  The music stops and a
	DRUM ROLL starts.  The stripper bends over Elaine's head
	and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in
	front of Elaine's face.

108	SHOT - BEN

	He leans forward slightly to watch the action.  The
	swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.

	The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster.  The tassels
	swing more frantically.

109	SHOT - ELAINE

	She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.

110	SHOT - BEN

	With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.

111	SHOT - ELAINE

	Through Ben's glasses.  Elaine's face seen darkly but
	fully for the first time.  The tassels swing in front
	of it.  Tears start out of her eyes.

112	SHOT - BEN

	He reaches up to remove the glasses.

113	SHOT - ELAINE

	As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh
	spill from the spotlight.  The tears are running down
	her face.  Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight
	at Ben.

114	SHOT - BEN

	With his glasses off, he watches her.  He reaches forward
	and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.

				STRIPPER
		Hey!

	Some of the customers start to boo.  Ben rises, takes
	Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.

								CUT TO:

115	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	The entrance to the strip joint.  Elaine runs to the
	bottom of the steps.  The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside
	is crowded with people moving back and forth.  Ben follows
	her.  She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk.  Ben
	catches her and holds her arm.

				BEN
		Elaine - I'm sorry.

	Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls
	her arm away.

				ELAINE
		Will you take me home now?

				BEN
		I'm sorry I took you in there.

				ELAINE
		I think I'd better go home now
		please.

				BEN
		But, Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Where is the car?

				BEN
		I just want to tell you something.

	Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying
	to get her to look at him.  She keeps looking away.

				ELAINE
		I want to go home.

				BEN
		But could I just tell you this
		one thing?

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		This whole idea - this date
		and everything.  It was my
		parents' idea.  They forced me
		into it.

				ELAINE
		Oh - that's very nice of
		you to tell me.

				BEN
		No.  What I mean is - that's
		why I've been acting this way.
		I'm not like this.  I hate
		myself like this.

	She starts to cry.  People on the sidewalk are looking at
	them.  She turns away from them.  Ben moves away from
	them.  Ben moves around in front of her.

				BEN
		Listen - could you stop crying,
		please?

				ELAINE
		No, I couldn't.

				BEN
		But could you try?

				ELAINE
		No.

	She brings both hands up to her face.  Ben looks at her
	for a few moments in agony.  Then, very determined, he
	takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from
	her face.  She looks up startled.  She starts to give a
	little cry but before she can he is kissing her.  She closes
	her eyes.

	He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side
	of her face.  He opens his hands against her face, freeing
	her hands.  Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang
	on.  After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly
	to one side.

		Elaine -

	He starts to pull her head back.

				ELAINE
		Not here.  Not here.

116	EXT. DRIVE IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in
	restaurant.  There are trays hooked onto windows along
	side of both of them.  They are eating and drinking
	furiously.

				BEN
		I've had this feeling - ever
		since I've graduated - this -
		kind of compulsion that I have
		to be rude all the time.  Do
		you know what I mean?

				ELAINE
		Yes, I do.

	He looks at her.

				BEN
		It's like I've been playing
		some kind of - game - but the
		rules don't make any sense to
		me -

	She is watching him carefully.

				BEN
		- they're being made up by all
		the wrong people - no - I mean
		no one makes them up, they seem
		to have made themselves up.

	A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the
	slot on their right.  Its RADIO is tuned into a rock
	and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY.  Ben leans
	across Elaine and speaks through the window to the
	kid behind the wheel.

				BEN
		Say - I wonder if I could request
		you to turn that down a little?

	The kid turns the radio up.  Ben and Elaine roll their
	windows up.

117	SERIES OF SHOTS

	From outside of car.  Ben is talking with great animation
	- Elaine is watching him.  They are both eating as Ben
	talks, telling Elaine a story.  Their windows are rolled
	up.

	SOUNDS: Cars GUNNING their ENGINES; horns HONKING;
	radios PLAYING; waitresses YELLING orders; customers
	YELLING at waitresses; kids LAUGHING and TALKING from
	car to car; MOTORCYCLES driving in and out, TRAFFIC.

118	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson
	house.  The RADIO plays QUIETLY.  Ben turns it OFF.  They
	sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's
	hand touching her shoulder.  It is very quiet.

				ELAINE
		Well - maybe I'd better go in.

	He nods.  They continue to sit there for another long
	moment.

				ELAINE
		Would you like to come in?  I
		could make some coffee.

				BEN
		No, I mean - I wouldn't want to
		wake anyone up.

				ELAINE
		We won't.  Let's go inside.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				ELAINE
		Is anything wrong?

				BEN
		No - I was just thinking -
		look - it's still early -
		we could do something - go
		somewhere else.

				ELAINE
		All right.

	He starts the car immediately and drives away from the
	house.

	Ben is driving.

				ELAINE

				BEN
		I'm trying to think of where

				ELAINE
		Isn't there one in the Taft
		Hotel?

	There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off
	the road.

				ELAINE
		What is the matter?

				BEN
		Nothing.  I'm just wondering if
		they have a bar or not.  I mean
		let's go see.  Let's go see if
		they do or not.

120	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside
	the door.  They start in a few steps.

				BEN
		Listen, Elaine - it seems to me

		I mean - as far as I know.

				ELAINE
		Of course there is.  Look -
		The Veranda Room - right there.

	ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out.

				CAR PARKER
		Good evening.

	CAMERS BEGINS TO PULL UP AND AWAY.  A BELLBOY passes

				BELLBOY
		Hello, how are you, sir?

	The room clerk smiles at them.

				ROOM CLERK
		Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

	Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the

	revealing many people moving back and forth in the
	lobby, passing Ben and Elaine.

				BEN
		I don't know.  They must think
		I look like this guy Gladstone.

	PAN WITH THEM as they start down the steps.  Coming up
	the steps toward them is Miss DeWitte, on the arm of
	another ELDERLY LADY.

				MISS DeWITTE
		Hello, Mr. Brannif.

	SOUND:  Car STARTING noisily.

122	EXT. TAFT HOTEL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off
	the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car
	speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He
	turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his
	head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head.

				BEN
		Elaine - I like you.  I like you
		so much.  Do you believe that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Do you?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		You're the first - you're the
		first thing for so long that
		I've liked.  The first person
		I could stand to be with.

	She takes his hand.

				BEN
		I mean my whole life is such a
		waste.  It's just nothing.  I'm
		sorry.  I'll take you home now.

	He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - are having an
		affair with someone?

	He freezes with his hand still on the key.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.

	He turns off the engine.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.  That is not my
		business.

				BEN
		It just happened.  It was just
		this thing that happened along
		with everything else.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				ELAINE
		Was she married or something?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		With a family?

				BEN
		Yes.  She had a husband and a

				ELAINE
		Did they ever find out?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		And it's all over now.

		Yes.

				ELAINE

		During the day?  We'll go for

				ELAINE
		Okay.

				BEN
		You sure you really want to?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

	SHOT - INT. BEN'S CAR - BEN DRIVING

	It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package.
	From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
	Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is
	playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the
	Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door
	of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out,
	dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps,
	reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side
	and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drive down the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I have a date
		with Elaine.  We're going for
		a drive.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at him
			for the first time)
		Do exactly what I say.

	Ben starts the car forward down the driveway.

125	ANOTHER ANGLE - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

	As they drive.

				BEN
		Now it seems to me -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Listen to me very carefully,
		Benjamin.  You are not to see
		Elaine again.  Ever.  Those
		are my orders.  Is that clear?

	Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down
	the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I can makes things quite unpleasant.

				BEN
		How?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In order to keep Elaine away
		from you - I am prepared to
		tell her everything.

				BEN
		I don't believe you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then you'd better start believing me.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it.  I'm
		asking you please not to wreck it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go home now.

				BEN
		I just don't believe you would do that.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Try me.

	There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.  Then
	he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on
	his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package.

	TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive-
	way toward the Robinson house.  Ben gets to the front
	door.

		I'm not dressed yet.

	Ben runs up the stairs.  He still carries the package.
	Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door
	to her bedroom.  She is wearing a skirt and slip and
	carrying one shoe.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed -

	Ben pushes her back into her room.

127	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

		Hurry up.  Put your shoes on.

	Ben turns and looks.

128	SHOT - OVER BEN'S SHOULDER

	Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house.

				BEN
		NO.

	He turns around.

129	NEW ANGLE

	Elaine is standing in the doorway watching him.  She
	still holds the shoe in her hand.

				BEN
		Why aren't you ready?

				ELAINE
		Because I want to know what's
		happening.

	SOUND of Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS in the hall below.

				BEN
		There isn't time!

130	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door.  They stand
	in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though
	they are hiding from someone.  Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS
	can be heard coming up the stairs.

				BEN
		Elaine - I have to tell you
		something.

	He holds her against the wall in the corner.

				ELAINE
		What is it?

				BEN
		That woman -

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		That woman.  The older woman.

				ELAINE
		You mean the one who -

				BEN
		Yes.  The married woman - it
		wasn't just some woman -

	Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the
	hall.

				ELAINE
		What are you telling me?

	The FOOTSTEPS stop.

131	ANGLE - CLOSE ON ELAINE

	Back in the corner.  Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the
	crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder.  Elaine looks from
	Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her
	mother's eyes staring.

				ELAINE
		Please - will somebody tell me -

	She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again.
	Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the
	door.  Elaine looks away.

				ELAINE
		Oh - no.

	Ben backs up.

				BEN
		Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Oh my God -

	Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben
	as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

				BEN
		Please.

	Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room
	then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out
	of her eyes.

				BEN
		No - don't cry -

				ELAINE
		GET OUT!

				BEN
		Don't cry.
			(holds the package
			out to her)

				ELAINE
		Get out of here.

	She moves toward him as though to hit him.  He backs into
	the hall.  Elaine SLAMS the door shut.

		Get out!

	Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben.

	from a MINUTE MAID container.  Ben stands inside door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Say that again.

				BEN
		I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

	MR. BRADDOCK STARTS TO SMILE.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Well - well - well -

	He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand
	to shake it.  Mrs. Braddock appears in the doorway.  Ben
	is shaking his father's hand.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What's happening?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben says he and Elaine are getting
		married.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		I don't believe it.

		Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Come on, let's call the Robinsons.
		We've got something to celebrate.

				BEN
		No.  I think you'll want to wait

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They don't know?

				BEN
		No - they don't.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well - when did you decide all
		this?

				BEN
		About an hour ago.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Wait a minute.  You talked to
		Elaine this morning?

				BEN
		No.  She doesn't know about it.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		She doesn't know that you're
		coming up to Berkeley?

				BEN
		No.  Actually - she doesn't
		know about us getting married
		yet.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		When did you two talk this over?

				BEN
		We haven't.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben - this whole idea sounds
		pretty half-baked.

				BEN
		No - it's not.  It's completely
		baked.  It's a decision I've made.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But what makes you think she
		wants to marry you?

	Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns.

168	SHOT - BEN

				BEN
		- it certainly has been nice -
		I think I'm late - yes, I am -

	He turns and walks away from them.  They stand still
	watching them go.  He starts to walk faster and faster.
	They watch him as he gets further and further away and
	then breaks into a run.  He disappears in the distance.

	SOUND:  Footsteps running, a door opening and closing,
	footsteps running upstairs, a door opening and slamming.

	Ben leans with his back against the closed door, breathing

171	INT. TELEGRAPH STREET RESTAURANT - DAY

	Ben is sitting at a table by the window through which
	we can see the street.  He is drinking a beer.  Other
	tables are filled with students having animated discussions.
	Ben starts to pour some beer from the bottle into the
	glass.  He stops as he sees something through the window.
	He leans forward.

	Elaine comes out of a bookstore across the street.  She
	crosses the street and moves to a bus stop.  He stands,
	fumbles in his pocket for money, puts a dollar on the
	table and rushes out.

172	EXT. RESTAURANT TELEGRAPH STREET - DAY

	Ben comes out of the door just as Elaine gets into a bus
	and the doors close behind her.

	The bus starts off.  Ben runs after it.  The bus gets to
	the next corner and stops for a red light.  Ben catches
	up with it, runs to the front door and knocks on the
	door.  The door opens and he climbs in.

174	INT. BUS NO. 1 - DAY - SHOT ELAINE

	She is seated next to an OLDER LADY by the window immediately
	in front of the rear exit door.  She keeps looking out
	the window, almost holding her breath as she hears:

				BEN'S VOICE
			(getting closer as
			he moves past people
			toward her)
		Excuse me - I'm sorry - I
		wonder if I could get by -
		excuse me -

	There is a pause and then, immediately behind her:

				BEN'S VOICE
			(cheerfully)
		Well - how about this for a
		coincidence.

175	NEW ANGLE

	Ben's face is right behind Elaine, between her and the older
	lady sitting next to her.  Ben is standing on the steps
	to the rear exit door.  Elaine continues to look out the
	window.

				BEN
			(leaning in a little)
		I was wondering where you were
		headed.

	Elaine doesn't answer.  The lady sitting next to Elaine
	takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben,
	then looks at Elaine again.

				ELAINE
		I'm meeting someone.

				BEN
		Ah.  Where?

	She doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Where are you meeting this person?

				ELAINE
		At the Zoo.

				BEN
		The Zoo.  They have a pretty good
		one here, do they?

				ELAINE
		I've never been to it.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, I haven't either.  I
		might just ride out there with you.

	Hold on them riding.

							CUT TO:

176	EXT. ZOO - DAY

	Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the
	outside animal cages.  Ben is walking a step or two behind
	Elaine.  He is darting glances to the right and left.

				BEN
		Is that him over there?

				ELAINE
		No.

				BEN
		Where did he say he was going
		to meet you?

				ELAINE
		I thought he said by the monkey
		house.

				BEN
		Oh.

	She stops.  Ben stops.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I would like to know
		what you're doing here.

				BEN
		Here?  In Berkelely?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, I have this very pleasant
		room on Carter Street - and I've
		been getting to some classes -

				ELAINE
		But you're not enrolled.

				BEN
		No.  I just sit in.  They don't
		seem to mind.  They've been
		very congenial about it.

	She looks at him and starts to shake her head.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - you're - I don't
		know what to say - you're --

				BEN
		Maybe we could get together
		some time and talk about it.

				ELAINE
		- really incredible -

				BEN
		Here he comes.

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		I've got a real feeling that
		this is the fellow.

	Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding
	briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH.

				CARL
			(waving)
		Elaine!

				BEN
		He certainly is a good walker.

	Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his
	mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and
	takes Elaine's hands.

				CARL
		Am I late?  I'm sorry.

				BEN
		We thought you said by the
		monkey house.

	Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
	Ben smiles.

				ELAINE
		This is Benjamin Braddock.
		Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode
		here with me on the bus.

				CARL
		Glad to meet you, Ben.

	Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand.

				BEN
		Great meeting you, Carl.

	Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder.
	The three of them look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Swell seeing you.  Have a good
		time.

	Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl
	and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben
	stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the
	cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back
	at:

177	SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE

	Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand
	gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.

178	SHOT - BEN

	As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears.
	The agony is such that he has to steady himself with
	his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the
	cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They
	look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device
	with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins
	to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

	He jumps to the other side of the window and peers out
	carefully.

	Elaine turns in and disappears into the rooming house
	front door below.

	BEN

	He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place.
	He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can,
	crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses
	to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and
	takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and
	sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It
	is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the
	bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron.
	He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires
	to straighten it out with the iron.

	There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron
	back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can,
	then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper
	on his lap.

				BEN
		Come in.

	There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens
	it.  Elaine is standing in the hall.

				ELAINE
		I want to ask you a question.

				BEN
		Come in.

				ELAINE
		No.  I want to know why you're
		here in Berkeley?

				BEN
		Because - I am.

				ELAINE
		Is it because I'm here?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				ELAINE
		I think it is.

	Ben nods.

				ELAINE
		I said I think it is.

				BEN
		All right then!  Yes!

				ELAINE
		Well, I want you to leave.

				BEN
		Elaine - I love you.

				ELAINE
			(looking down)
		How could you do that, Benjamin?

	Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm.

				ELAINE
		Do you just hate everything?
		How could you possibly rape
		my...

				BEN
		What?

				ELAINE
		I don't understand -

				BEN
		Did you say rape her?

				ELAINE
		- how you - how anyone - could
		do a thing like that.

				BEN
		What did she say?

				ELAINE
			(holding his arm)
		Let me go.

				BEN
		You've got to tell me what she
		said.

	He touches her hair.

				ELAINE
		Why?

				BEN
		Because it isn't true.

				ELAINE
		I don't feel well.

	Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed.  He kneels
	along side her.

				BEN
		Tell me.

	Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.

				ELAINE
		She said she was having a drink
		in the hotel with a friend.
		You waited for her in the parking
		lot and told her she was too
		drunk to drive home and that
		you would get her a room for
		the night.

				BEN
		Then what?

				ELAINE
		Then you took her upstairs and
		you raped her.

				BEN
		Elaine - that is not what happened.

	She puts her hands on his shoulder.

				ELAINE
		Please let me go.

				BEN
		All right - but listen to me.
		What happened was there was
		this party at my parents.  I
		drove your mother home - then
		we went upstairs to see your
		portrait -

	Elaine tightens her arms around his neck.

				ELAINE
		Don't tell me -

				BEN
		- and when we got up in the
		room she starts taking her her
		clothes off - and -

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - this is my mother!

				BEN
		- suddenly there she was without
		any clothes on - I mean really
		naked -

	Ben is almost lying on top of her.  Elaine screams - a
	long, loud scream.  Ben looks at her.  He leaps off
	the bed and runs to the sink.  He fills a glass with
	water and brings it to Elaine.  He starts toward the
	door.

	SOUND OF FOOTESTEPS on the stairway and in the hall.
	Ben goes to the closet, opens the door, takes a jacket
	from a hanger and puts it on.

	SOUND:  A KNOCK on the door.

				MR. McCLEERY'S VOICE
		What's going on in there?

	Elaine sits up and drinks the water.  Ben looks at
	her then goes to the door and opens it.

				BEN
		Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Who screamed?

				BEN
		It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Screaming isn't all right.  Not
		in my house it isn't.

				BEN
		It was just a visitor.  But it's
		all right now.

	Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see
	into the room.  Ben edges through the door into the
	hallway.

184	INT. ROOMING HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

				MR. McCLEERY
		What did you do to her?

				BEN
		Look - she's all right.  She's
		upset and she screamed.  But
		she's okay now.

				A BOY
		Shall I get the cops?

				BEN
		What?

				A BOY
		I'll get the cops.

	He starts for the stairs.

				BEN
		Hey - wait a minute.  Now damn
		it - look.

	He opens the door a little way.  They all try to see in.

				BEN
		See - she's just having some
		water.  Now there's no need
		for the cops or anything.

				MR. McCLEERY
		All right, boys - I think you
		can get back to your rooms.  I
		don't think we'll have any more
		of this agitation.  Will we,
		Braddock?

				BEN
		No, sir.

	The boys start back to their rooms.  Mr. McCleery and Ben
	stand and look at each other for a few seconds.

				MR. McCLEERY
		I want you out of here.

	Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts
	down the stairs.

				BEN
		Mr. McCleery?

				MR. McCLEERY
		You heard me.  Out of here.

				BEN
		What for?

				MR. McCLEERY
			(going down the
			stairs)
		Because I don't like you.

	Mr. McCleery disappears down the stairs.  Ben turns and
	goes back into the room.

185	INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Elaine is standing at the sink.  She is putting water on
	her face.  Ben goes to the closet and takes out his suit-
	case and carries it to the bed.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry I screamed.

	Ben opens the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin, when you came up here,
		what did you think was going to
		happen between us?

				BEN
		Elaine - right now I don't feel
		like talking much.  I'm sorry
		about everything but I think I'll
		just do this now.

	He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Can I just sit here while you're
		packing?

				BEN
		If you want.

	Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to
	the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them
	in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets
	down on his knees and looks under the bureau.

				ELAINE
		What are you looking for?

				BEN
		My belt.

				ELAINE
		Don't you have it on?

				BEN
		No.  I have two.  The other one
		is the one I'm looking for.
			(he reaches under
			the bureau)
		What's this?
			(he brings out a
			marble)
		It's from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		The marble?

				BEN
		The belt I'm looking for was
		from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		Oh.

	Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it.

				ELAINE
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I don't know.

	He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear
	and carries them to the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Are you going home?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Well - where are you going?

	He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out
	some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the
	suitcase.

				BEN
		Elaine - you're going to have to
		stop asking me that.

	He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to
	the bureau and puts it back in the drawer, takes some
	ties from the drawer and crosses to the suitcase.  Elaine
	gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

				BEN
		I don't understand.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to go anywhere
		until you have a definite plan.

				BEN
		But Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Goodbye.

	She walks out, shutting the door behind her.  He crosses
	to the window.

	He gets out of the bed.

		Will you kiss me!

	He goes to her and they kiss.

				BEN
		Will you marry me?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		You won't?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

				BEN
		But you might.

				ELAINE
		I might.

				BEN
		Is that so?  You might marry me?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		When?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

				BEN
		How about tomorrow?  I don't mean
		to be pushy but -

				ELAINE
		I don't know.  I don't know what's
		happening.

				BEN
		You mean you're confused?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well - look - don't be confused.
		We're getting married.

				ELAINE
		I don't see how we can.

				BEN
		We just can.

				ELAINE
		I have to go back now.

	She goes to the door.

				BEN
		Elaine - are you serious about this?

				ELAINE
		I'll think about it.

				BEN
		You really will?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

	She opens the door and steps into the hall.  He goes to the

		Do you want - do you want to try

				BEN
		Mr. Robinson?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you have a special grudge
		against me?  Do you feel a particularly
		strong resentment for me?

				BEN
		No, it's not --

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is there something I've said that's
		caused this contempt?  Or is it just
		the things I stand for that you
		despise?

				BEN
		It was nothing to do with you, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to
		do with me.

	Ben takes a step forward.

				BEN
		Now look - please -

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, I think we're two civilized
		human beings.  Do you think it's
		necessary to threaten each other?

				BEN
		I am not threatening you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you want to unclench your fists,
		please?  Thank you.  I can see in
		the dark, you know.  I've been here
		quite a while.

				BEN
		I am trying to tell you I have no
		personal feelings about you, Mr.
		Robinson.  I am trying to tell
		you I do not resent you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You don't respect me terribly
		much either, do you?

				BEN
		No, I don't.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, I don't think we have a
		whole lot to say to each other,
		Ben.  I do think you should know
		the consequences of what you've
		done.  I do think you should
		know that my wife and I are
		getting a divorce soon.

				BEN
		But why?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Why?

				BEN
		It shouldn't make any difference
		what happened.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's quite a statement.

				BEN
		Listen to me.  We got - we got
		into bed with each other.  But
		it was nothing.  It was nothing
		at all.  We might - we might just
		as well have been shaking hands.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Shaking hands.  Well, that's not
		saying much for my wife, is it?

				BEN
		You miss the point.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Don't shout at me, Ben.

				BEN
		The point is - I don't love your
		wife.  I love your daughter, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well - I'm sure you think you do,
		Ben, but after a few times in
		bed with Elaine I feel quite sure
		you'd get over that as quickly
		as you -

				BEN
		HUH?

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think I've talked about this
		enough.  I don't know how far
		I can go, Ben.  I don't know if
		I can prosecute or not, but I
		think maybe I can.  In the light
		of what's happened I think maybe
		I can get you behind bars if you
		ever look at my daughter again.
		I have seen Elaine and I have
		spent the afternoon taking steps
		to insure...

	Mr. Robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door.
	Ben takes a step toward him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Stay away from me, Ben!

	Mr. Robinson stands at the door.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I don't want to mince words with
		you.  As far as Elaine's concerned
		you're to get her out of your
		filthy mind right now.  Is that
		perfectly clear ro you?  That's
		all, Ben.  You'll pardon me if
		I don't shake hands with you.

	Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are filth.

	Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are scum.

	Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs.  Mr. McCleery is
	standing on the stairway, listening.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You are a degenerate!

                                  Nick Schenk





          FADE IN:

          INT. CHURCH

          We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance
          are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored
          teenagers.
          WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He
          speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.

          OLDER MAN
          I'm real sorry about Dorothy,
          Walt. She was a real peach.

          WALT
          Thanks for coming, Al.
          Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue
          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
          Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his
          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
          Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
          his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his
          GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.

          WALT
          Jesus Christ.
          Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from
          across the pews.

          MITCH
          Look at the Old Man glaring at
          Ashley. He can't even tone it
          down at Mom's funeral?

          STEVE
          What do you expect? Dad's still
          living in the 50s. He expects
          his granddaughter to dress a
          little more modestly.

          MITCH
          Yeah, well your kid's wearing a
          Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad
          appreciates that.

          STEVE
          My point is that there's nothing
          anyone can do that won't
          disappoint the Old Man.

          (MORE)

          (CONTINUED)

          PAGE 3
          It's inevitable. That's why we
          stopped doing Thanksgivings; the
          deal with the boat motor, the
          broken bird bath, it's always
          something.

          MITCH
          What are we going to do with him?
          Don't you think he'll get in
          trouble by himself over in the old
          neighborhood?

          STEVE
          Why don't you have him move in
          with you?

          MITCH
          Ha ha.

          INT. CHURCH - LATER


          The choir sings the Beatitudes.
          Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
          one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes
          and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish.
          FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up
          to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife.
          Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak,
          unconvincing words of Father Janovich.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Death... is often a bittersweet
          occasion to us Catholics. Bitter
          in the pain it causes the deceased
          ... and their families. Sweet to
          those who know the salvation that
          awaits them. And some may ask,
          what is death. Is it the end? Or
          is it the beginning? And what is
          life? What is this thing we call
          life?

          WALT
          Jesus.
          Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
          He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white
          cloth.

          CONTINUED:


          INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

          The house is crammed with people following the service.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to
          keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.

          STEVE
          A lot of people showed up after
          the service.

          WALT
          Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew
          there'd be plenty of ham. I think
          I'll go downstairs and get some
          more chairs.

          STEVE
          I'll do it, Dad.

          WALT
          Naw, we need them now, not next
          week.

          INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME

          Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in
          the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed
          through.

          Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT
          looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are
          sprawled dead on the ground.

          DAVID
          Is that Dad?

          DANIEL
          No, it's Grandpa Walt.
          Josh turns the photo over and reads it...

          JOSH
          Third Platoon, E company, March
          second, 1952, Korea.'

          DANIEL
          Where's Korea?

          JOSH
          Hell if I know?
          David holds up a MEDAL.

          They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt
          descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch,
          pretending to be doing nothing.
          Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.

          People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents,
          KAREN and Mitch.

          ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)
          How long do we have to stay, this
          ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
          and I'm bored.
          Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
          he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and Karen are
          embarrassed.

          MITCH
          Ashley, honey. Why don't you help
          Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

          ASHLEY
          Me?

          KAREN
          Yes you.

          ASHLEY
          Grandpa Walt, can I help you with
          the chairs.

          WALT
          I'll take care of it, you just
          painted your nails.
          Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
          It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks
          relieved to get out of the house.

          WALT
          I'd better salt the sidewalk
          before someone falls and breaks a
          hip.
          Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very,
          very, very old DOG follows him outside.

          Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately
          stops at the boundary of his property.
          The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now
          mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged
          to Polish families.
          Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.
          Walt can see through the window that the living room is
          jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.
          And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full-
          blown, unrepentant racist.
          Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.

          WALT
          Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats
          can they cram into a living room?
          Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.

          Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a
          cigarette. She has pulled back the canvas tarp that
          covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO.
          The Gran Torino is in mint condition. It has been babied
          since the day it rolled off the line.
          Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.

          ASHLEY
          Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the
          vintage car?
          Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
          burning cigarette before answering.

          WALT

          1972.

          ASHLEY
          I never knew you had a cool old
          car.

          WALT
          It's only been in here since
          before you were born.

          Walt lights up a smoke --

          WALT
          Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
          Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.

          ASHLEY
          Then what about that super cool
          retro couch in the den, I'm going
          to State next year and I don't
          have, like, any furniture?
          Walt walks out without commenting.

          8
          The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing
          there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy. Walt scowls.
          TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very
          good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.

          WALT
          Who the hell are you?

          TAO
          (very quietly)
          I'm Tao, I live next door.

          WALT
          What?! Speak up, boy, get the
          shit out of your mouth. What do
          you want?

          TAO
          Do you have jumper cables? My
          uncle's car is old and...

          WALT
          No. And have some goddamned
          respect, zipper head, we're
          mourning over here.
          Walt slams the door in Tao's face.
          Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
          Walt hates situations like this.

          Mr. Kowalski.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Huh?

          WALT
          It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife
          and I became quite close these
          last few months. She asked that I
          watch over you when she passed on.
          I told her I watch out for my
          entire flock, but she made me
          promise I'd keep an extra sharp
          eye on you.

          WALT
          I appreciate your kindness to my
          wife and now that you've spoken
          your piece, why don't you move on
          to the next sheep?
          Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Dorothy mentioned specifically
          that it was her wish for you to go
          to confession. She said she
          couldn't remember the last time
          you went.

          WALT
          Is that so?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          It is.
          Walt drains his lowball glass.

          WALT
          Well, I confess I never much liked
          church and only went because of
          the wife. And I confess I have no
          desire to confess to a boy who is
          fresh out of the seminary.

          People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling,
          stiff-jointed old Pollacks.
          Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
          more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter
          and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy
          bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home.
          The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old
          baby is named and three souls are located for the
          newborn.

          CUT TO:

          ANOTHER ANGLE
          Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
          ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables
          to their dead battery.
          Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a
          brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.

          MITCH
          I'd really like to help, Dad, but
          we have to get the kids home,
          they're getting restless.
          Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
          and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.

          WALT
          Fine. Go.

          MITCH
          I'll call in a few, see how you're

          The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their
          heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
          The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
          It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to

          English and Hmong.
          (NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.)
          Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN.

          There's no man in this house,
          that's why my daughter should

          better than having a woman be the

          The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of
          dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink,
          without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an
          insult.
          In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong Soul Calling ceremony
          starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is
          present and begins the ritual.

          front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the
          snow.
          A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand
          around the stunned, prone Tao.

          HEAD LATINO

          gonna Kung Fu' us?

          Surprised it ain't a girl's bike.

          the first swing. You drop me and

          What the fuck you smiling at,
          gook? Something funny?
          He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.

          Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors'
          houses are rundown.
          Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped
          screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed
          a chicken coop.
          Walt looks down at Daisy --

          Damn chinks let their yards go to

          me, Mr. Kowalski?

          WALT
          You don't want to know.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          No, I do.

          WALT
          The problem is I think you're an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who holds the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promises them eternity.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          18
          Tao walks down the street, his head in a book. He
          finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly
          behind him.
          The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace
          with his step. Tao looks over to the occupants of the
          Chevy.
          It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy
          easily keeps up with Tao.

          LATINO DRIVER
          Is you a boy or a girl, I can't
          tell?

          LATINO #2
          What you reading, gook, Jackass
          And The Rice Stalk?
          Tao laughs, but keeps walking.

          LATINO DRIVER
          That's right, you keep walking.
          Fucking slopes everywhere you
          look, man. Why gooks come up in
          here and fuck up our neighborhood?
          Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big
          SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers.
          The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the
          Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at
          Tao.

          SPIDER
          Dude, that's my little cousin,
          Tao.

          SMOKIE
          You sure about that, Spider?

          SPIDER
          I'm sure. Do we do something...
          or what?
          Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second.

          SMOKIE
          Your cousin tight with anyone?

          SMOKIE
          Okay. Let's go help out our
          little cousin.
          Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across
          from Tao and the Latinos' car.

          SMOKIE
          You better not be giving my bro
          here a hard time or you're gonna
          wish you never been born.

          LATINO DRIVER
          Oh goody, more Rice Niggers.
          The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL.
          A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays
          a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned.

          LATINO #2
          Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go
          back to your fucking rice paddy.
          The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs
          in the car smile and congratulate themselves.
          Tao simply keeps walking down the street!

          SMOKIE
          Where the fuck does he think he's
          going? Turn us around and go
          after that cousin of yours.
          They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with
          him as he walks.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz, slow down, where you
          going? You should really think
          about hanging with us, man. If we
          all stick together, shit like that
          won't happen, with those Spicks.
          Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.

          SPIDER
          You can't be such a little girl.
          You join up with us, we'll keep
          you out of trouble, cuz.

          gangbanger in the back seat.
          Smokie takes this all in. He looks down the street and
          sees that in a half block, Tao will have to pass a group
          of Latino gangbanger types.

          SMOKIE
          You think about it and we'll see

          19
          Tao digs in the garden. Tao's younger sister SUE sits
          and reads JANE magazine on the porch.
          The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up.
          Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue.

          SUE
          What do you want?

          SPIDER
          Came to talk to my cousin Tao.
          Smokie looks over to Sue.

          SMOKIE
          Spider, who's the other cousin?
          SUE laughs at the name Spider. Sue is seventeen, has
          long straight hair with red highlights.

          SUE
          Spider'? Is that what he just
          called you, Fong?

          SPIDER
          This is my little cousin, Sue.
          Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.

          SMOKIE
          Hey, Sue... how old are you, girl?

          SUE
          Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
          I'm going inside.

          men talk.

          SUE
          Yeah, that's exactly what I'm
          doing, Fong.
          Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside. Smokie stares at
          Tao.

          SPIDER
          You think about what we talked
          about?
          A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a
          cigarette. Tao shakes his head no and looks at the
          ground.

          SMOKIE
          That's exactly the point, Tao.
          Spider told me how everyone thinks
          you're a pushover, how everybody
          walks all over you and shit. I
          mean, look at you, out here
          working in the garden like a
          woman.
          Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.

          SMOKIE
          It ain't no big thing. You just
          need a little guidance.
          Tao looks up at Smokie. Tao looks a little skeptical.

          SMOKIE
          It's true, man. Shit, I used to
          be kind of a quiet little punk
          like you, everybody fucking with
          me. But finally I said no more.'
          You, you're lucky, Tao, we got
          your back. Me? I didn't have
          nobody. Had to mold my own tribe.

          SPIDER
          Smokie's right. We're family,
          right? You with us or what?

          SMOKIE
          I swear, brother, we're the best
          friends you'll ever have. And
          anyone fucks with you, they're
          fucked.

          TAO
          What do I have to do?
          Smokie points to Walt's open garage.

          SMOKIE
          Spider mentioned that neighbor of
          yours.

          Walt's gorgeous, shining GRAN TORINO.

          Now that's a car.

          Walt sits at the bar in the VFW (Veterans of Foreign
          Wars) drinking with the old buddies and cracking off-
          color jokes.

          WALT
          I got one. A Mexican, a Jew and a
          colored guy walk into a bar, the
          bartender looks up at them and
          says -- get the fuck out.'
          The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up
          to the bar. He smiles as he recognizes several faces.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          So, here's where my flock

          Walt says nothing. He just sips his beer.

          What brings you in here, Father?
          The meat raffle?

          No. I came down to talk to Walt,
          if that's okay.
          Mel and Darrel look at Walt. It puts him on the spot.

          I have to hand it to you, Padre.
          You are persistent.

          Jesus Christ, why'd you do that?

          You sure are fond of promising
          people stuff you can't deliver on.

          Let's talk about something else.

          WALT
          Like what?

          Life and death.

          WALT
          What would you know about it?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'd like to think I know a lot.
          I'm a priest.

          WALT
          You stand at the altar and preach
          on and on about life and death
          without knowing anything other
          than what you learned in priest
          school. Everything you say sounds
          like it's out of the Rookie
          Preachers Handbook.

          WALT
          Death is bittersweet? Bitter in
          the pain, sweet in the salvation.'
          That's what you know of life and
          death? Good God, it's pathetic.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

          WALT
          Plenty. I lived with death for
          three years in Korea. We shot
          people, we stabbed them with
          bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year-
          old kids to death with shovels,
          for Christ's sake. I did things
          that won't leave me till the day I
          die, horrible things, things I
          have to live with.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          And what about life?
          Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his
          answer.

          WALT
          Well... I survived the war... got
          married... and raised a family.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Sounds like you know more about
          death than you do living.

          The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at

          beam of a flashlight in his garage.

          the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea.
          Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and
          chambers a round with a loud SNAP.

          The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face
          to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE.
          Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better
          aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao
          drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud
          metallic clang.
          Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs
          up, Walt advances, step for step.
          Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip.
          They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with
          the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
          As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE
          RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer
          sign on the wall.
          Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
          Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
          Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs
          down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb
          still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.

          Tao runs right past him. Spider guns the motor and pulls
          in front of Tao. Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger

          MITCH
          Right, good afternoon, then.

          WALT
          So, what do you want?

          MITCH
          Me? Nothing. What would I want?

          WALT
          I don't know. Your wife already
          went through all of your mother's
          jewelry.

          MITCH
          No. I was just wondering how you
          are, what's going on, anything new
          in the old neighborhood?
          Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.

          WALT
          Nope.

          MITCH
          Great. Smooth sailing then?

          WALT
          Yup.
          There's a very painful pause in the conversation.

          MITCH
          Well good... Say, Dad?

          WALT
          Uh-huh.

          MITCH
          Do you still know that guy from
          the plant who has Viking season
          tickets?

          Walt has parked the Gran Torino at an angle across his
          driveway. Walt mutters as he rubs Turtle Wax on his car.

          It's stunning. It absolutely sparkles. The chrome
          shines, the tires look new and the paint is waxed and
          polished.
          Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood
          in defiance. A couple of Hmong teenagers look at the
          car.

          WALT

          (MUTTERS)
          That's right, ain't she pretty.
          Walt drops down heavily into an old lawn chair and pops
          open a can of Pabst.

          Dusk is falling. Walt finally gets up, folds up his lawn
          chair and walks stiffly back into the garage.
          Walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the Gran
          Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway. The
          whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular
          Mechanics.
          Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
          light comes on. The Gran Torino remains in the driveway.
          It's a challenge, an invitation. Walt is daring the
          thief to come back. And Walt's ready this time.

          The tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at
          Walt's. It pulls up in front of Tao's house. Tao and
          Sue exchange looks out on the front step.
          Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking
          confidently up the sidewalk towards them. They grin,
          they're cocky.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz. What's up?

          TAO

          SMOKIE
          We're giving you another shot.

          TAO
          I don't think so.

          SMOKIE
          You blew it the first time. We've
          got another little inauguration
          planned for you. This time
          there'll be no mistakes.

          SUE
          Another big, tough gangbanger with
          little-man' complex.
          Smokie leers at Sue. It makes her uncomfortable.

          SMOKIE
          I got my eye on you too, little
          girl.

          SUE
          Whatever.

          SMOKIE
          Come on, Tao. Let's go.
          Tao says nothing. He looks at the ground.

          SPIDER
          He said, let's go.

          SMOKIE
          Come on, man. Nobody's gonna get
          hurt. We'll take care of you.

          SUE
          Don't go, Tao.

          SMOKIE
          You mind your own business, girl.
          Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms.
          The front door swings open and there stands a glaring
          Phong.

          than you. You always let little
          girls and old ladies fight for
          you?
          Tao tries to squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair
          and opens his coat to reveal the PISTOL in his belt.

          SMOKIE
          I'm not gonna say it again. Let's
          go. Now.
          Tao is shoved towards the car.
          Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the
          gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks
          free.

          SUE
          Run, Tao, run!
          Sue is slapped to the ground.

          SUE

          RUN!!
          Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face. Tao's
          mother comes out the front door.
          Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other
          gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay.
          A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into
          the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their
          pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face
          and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
          Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes
          a pushing, rolling, surging melee.
          This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard.

          And before anyone can blink, WALT has the muzzle of his
          big 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle pointing at Smokie's face.

          WALT
          Get off my lawn.

          WALT
          I said get off my lawn. Now.
          Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers.
          The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big
          military rifle Walt holds.

          SMOKIE
          Are you fucking crazy? Go back in

          blow a big hole in your face and
          it won't bother me a bit, not any
          more than if I shot a deer. Now
          get off my goddamned lawn.
          Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back. Walt
          senses their fear. Only Smokie holds his ground.

          WALT
          Believe me, kid, I'll blow your
          damn head off, go back to bed and
          sleep like a baby. I couldn't

          WALT
          You're nothing to me. In Korea,

          Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks, but
          melt back towards their car.

          The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the

          Walt looks at Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in
          stunned silence in his front yard.
          A PAUSE. Finally, Sue speaks up...

          Hmongs. His garbage is overflowing.
          Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple, they smile
          carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables.
          Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop.

          WALT
          No. No more.
          The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn
          around.

          Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard. They gesture
          towards Walt's house. The women buzz around Tao, all

          Phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her.
          Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his

          up his hands, indicating they've come far enough.
          Sue holds up a plant.

          SUE
          We brought you some shallots to
          plant in your garden.

          bunch of jabbering gooks off my

          Well, you're a hero to the

          Pardon?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I do work with some of the Hmong
          gangs and I heard there was some
          trouble in the neighborhood. Why
          didn't you call the police?

          Oh, I prayed for them to show up,
          but guess what? No answer.

          Not that it's any of your

          things happen quickly like that,
          you have to react. In Korea, we
          never called the police' when a
          swarm of screaming gooks came
          pouring into our lines. We
          reacted.

          We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
          Walt says nothing.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I've been thinking about our
          discussion on life and death.
          About what you said. About how
          you carry around the horrible
          things you were forced to do.
          Horrible things that won't leave
          you. It seems that it would do
          you good to unload some of that
          burden. Things done during war
          are terrible, being ordered to
          kill, killing to save others,
          killing to save yourself. You're
          right, those are things I don't
          know anything about. But I do
          know about forgiveness. And I've
          seen a lot of men who have
          confessed their sins, admitted
          their guilt and left their burdens
          behind them. Stronger men than
          you. Men at war who were ordered
          to do appalling things and are now
          at peace.
          Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.

          WALT
          I'm impressed. You came with your
          guns loaded, for once.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Thank you.

          WALT
          You have balls, Father. And what
          you said, you're right. I'm sure
          stronger men than me have found
          their salvation. Hallelujah. But
          there's one thing you're way wrong

          here, but you just hang in there,
          you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you.

          BARBER
          That'll be ten dollars, Walt.

          WALT
          Ten dollars? Jesus Christ,
          Martin, you keep raising the
          price. You sure you're not part
          Jew?
          Martin the Barber laughs at Walt.

          BARBER
          It's been ten bucks for the last
          five years and you know it, you
          thick-skulled, old Pollack son of
          a bitch.

          WALT
          Here's ten, keep the change.

          BARBER
          See you in three weeks, you prick.

          WALT
          If you live that long, dipshit.
          Walt and Martin shake hands and Walt walks out.

          Walt gets in his old Ford pickup and drives off. This is
          a very bad, rundown neighborhood.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - SAME TIME


          37

          37
          Sue walks with her ridiculous Wigger (urban white kid)
          boyfriend, TREY. Trey wears big baggy pants, a sports
          jersey and an Oakland Raiders visor upside-down and
          backwards.
          They walk past three BLACK GUYS leaning against a
          building. The TALL BLACK GUY spots Sue and smiles.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Hey, girl, you come over here and
          talk to me. Come on, baby, don't
          be shy.
          Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can
          to avoid the black guys. They try to ignore them.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Come on, sweetie, don't be like
          that. You talk to me, don't be
          all stuck up and shit.

          ACROSS THE STREET
          Walt waits at a stoplight. He watches Sue and Trey and
          the three black guys who block their path.
          One black guy flips Trey's VISOR onto the ground. The
          Tall Guy makes kissy faces at Sue as he touches his
          crotch.
          Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt
          solves every situation by being aggressive.
          Walt drives off, then makes a U-turn.
          The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What are you sposed to be?
          Trey puts up his hand to hi-five. The Tall Black Guy
          just looks at him.

          TREY
          Yo, it's cool, dog.

          What the fuck are you doing in my
          neighborhood, boy?

          TREY
          Nothing. We're going to Red Roost
          to get some CDs. That place is
          trippin', bro.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What you call me, you fucking with
          me, bitch? You think you're
          funny?

          TREY
          Nothing. No.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          I'm warning you, boy. What you
          all come up in here for? You here
          to bring me this present?

          TREY
          Huh?

          TALL BLACK GUY
          This Oriental yummy for me? Don't
          worry, I'll take good care of her.

          SUE
          Great, another asshole with a
          fetish for Asian girls. God, it
          gets so old.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What's your name, girl?

          SUE
          My name? It's take your crude,
          overly obvious come-on to every
          woman who walks past and cram it.'
          That's my name.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You should keep your bitch on a
          leash, put a choke chain on this
          whore and yank.

          SUE
          Oh, of course, right to the
          stereotype thesaurus. Call me
          whore' and bitch' in the same
          sentence.

          The Tall Black Guy grabs Sue by the arm. Trey moves
          slightly towards Sue and is pushed down into a pile of
          garbage.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You think you're pretty funny,
          don't you?

          SUE
          What, are you gonna hit me now?
          That'd pretty much complete the
          picture.
          The Tall Black Guy pushes Sue hard against the wall.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You don't know when to quit.
          The old, black pickup pulls up and stops next to them.
          Sue, Trey and the black guys look over.
          Walt sits behind the wheel, he looks right through the
          Tall Black Guy.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What the fuck you looking at, old
          man?

          WALT
          You... and your buddies. What's
          the matter with you? Don't any of
          you work? I see you lazy show-
          offs in the middle of the day,
          slowly walking across the street
          or harassing women. Nobody owes
          you bastards anything so go out
          and get a job instead of pushing
          little girls around, for Christ's
          sake.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Why don't you get the fuck out of
          here, while I'll still let you.

          BLACK GUY #2
          That's right, bitch.

          WALT
          What makes you spooks think you
          can bully a couple kids with
          impunity?

          around.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You are fucking crazy.

          WALT
          You have to be pretty goddamned
          dumb to think you can push people
          around without running into
          someone who will push back.
          The black guys are a bit dumbfounded. Walt stares them
          down.

          WALT
          But you might just be dumb enough
          not to recognize that your luck
          just ran out.
          All bravado drains away from the black guys. Walt is a
          rock.
          Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Fuck this guy. He ain't worth it.
          The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to
          miss a green light.
          Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's...

          TREY
          Man, thanks a lot, mister.
          Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like
          an idiot. Trey slowly lowers his arm.
          Walt looks at Trey's outfit.

          WALT
          Go home, clown... and pull up your
          goddamned pants.

          Walt and Sue drive in silence. Finally Sue speaks up.

          SUE
          So, what's with you, you have some
          sort of savior complex or
          something?

          WALT
          What in the hell's the matter with
          you? I thought all you Asian
          girls were supposed to be so
          smart. What are you doing walking
          around in that neighborhood?
          That's how you end up in the
          obituaries, that is, if they can
          identify your body once they pull
          it out of the goddamned river.

          SUE
          I know, I know. Take it easy.
          Walt looks at her for a second. She's not ruffled at
          all.
          They drive.

          WALT
          So, that goofball back there.
          He's your boyfriend?

          SUE
          Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey.

          WALT
          Why in the hell would you go out
          with a clown like that. Why don't
          you date one of your... own...one
          of those other... Hu-mungs.

          SUE
          You mean, Hmong? We're Hmong, not
          Hu-mung.

          WALT
          Right. Hmong. What is a... where
          is Hmong or whatever?
          Sue laughs.

          SUE
          Wow! You're so enlightened.
          Hmong isn't a place, it's a
          people.

          WALT
          Then why are you in my
          neighborhood, instead of back
          there?

          SUE
          It's a Vietnam thing. We fought
          on your side and when America
          quit, the Communists starting
          killing the Hmong, so we came over
          here.
          Walt is quiet for few seconds.

          WALT
          Why'd you pick the Midwest, for
          Christ's sake? There's snow on
          the ground near half the year.
          Jungle people on the frozen
          tundra?

          SUE
          Hill people. We were hill people,
          not jungle people. Boo-ga, boo-
          ga, boo-ga.

          WALT
          Whatever.

          SUE
          Blame the Lutherans. They brought
          us here.

          WALT
          Still, you'd think the cold would
          keep all the assholes away.
          Sue laughs again at Walt's conscienceless racism.

          SUE
          Thanks for the ride.

          WALT
          Sure... You know, you seem okay.

          It's really common. Hmong girls

          mumbling under her breath.

          WALT
          Your birthday today; This year you
          have to make a choice between two
          life paths. Second chances come

          Mitch and Karen sit across from Walt. A small store-
          bought birthday cake sits in front of Walt.
          Walt reads his birthday card. It's signed; Love Mitch,
          Karen, Ashley and Josh. ALL the signatures have been
          written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen.
          Mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to Walt.

          MITCH
          Go ahead, Dad. Open it.

          WALT
          What is it?

          MITCH
          Just open it.
          Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool --
          the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up
          objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc.
          Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.

          MITCH
          It's a Gopher. It's so you can
          reach stuff. You know, it makes
          things easier.

          KAREN
          Here's one from me.

          There's nothing wrong with making
          things less hard on yourself.

          MITCH
          Karen's right, Dad. You've worked
          hard your whole life. Maybe you
          should think about taking it a
          little easier?
          Walt lights up a cigarette.

          MITCH
          And that's another thing, Dad.
          You should get rid of the coffin
          nails.

          And the house, now that Mom's
          gone, it's got to be a lot to
          maintain, let alone clean... and
          you're all alone in here.
          It's worse than Walt thought. He puffs smoke.

          KAREN
          There's these great places now,
          these communities where you don't
          have to worry about mowing the
          lawn or shoveling snow. People
          who are like you, alert, active,

          being with other folks their own

          Son of a bitch! He just won't let
          anyone help him.

          KAREN
          Well, we tried. Now we can just
          drop it. No one can say we didn't

          MITCH
          To hell with him, kicking us out
          on his birthday?! We should've

          even come. The goddamned kids are

          We miss Momma, don't we, Daisy.
          A vehicle pulls up to Tao's house. A party is in full
          swing.
          Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big
          platters of food and carry them to the house.
          Sue catches Walt's gaze and steps over to his porch.

          SUE
          Hey, Walt, what are you up to?
          Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his
          hand.

          SUE
          We're having a barbecue. You want
          to come over?

          WALT
          What do you think?

          SUE
          There's tons of food.

          WALT
          I'll bet. Just keep your paws off
          my dog.

          SUE
          No worries, we only eat cats.

          WALT
          Really?

          SUE
          No, I'm kidding, you moron. Come
          on, come on over. You can be my
          special guest.

          WALT
          I'm fine right here.
          Walt reaches into the cooler for another beer. It's
          empty, just water and ice.

          jerky.

          Come on over and get something to
          eat. We've got beer, too.

          Oh, what the hell. It's my
          birthday, I may as well drink with

          Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his
          shoulder.

          WALT
          You do have a lot of beer, but no
          Pabst.

          SUE
          As they say, When in Hmong.

          WALT
          Ha ha. Are you sure it's okay I'm
          here? Everyone keeps looking at
          me and when I look back, they look
          at the ground.

          She said welcome to our home.

          relatives are embarrassed at the outburst.

          She hates me.

          SUE
          Yes, she hates you.

          WALT
          What did I do?
          A little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the
          head. Everyone in the room looks in horror at Walt.

          WALT
          What?! What the hell are all you
          fish heads looking at?!
          Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room.

          SUE
          A lot of the people in this house
          are very traditional. Number one,
          never touch a Hmong person on the
          head, not even a child. Hmong
          people believe that the soul
          resides in the head, so don't do
          that.

          WALT
          That's dumb, but fine.

          SUE
          Hmong people also consider looking
          someone in the eye to be rude.
          That's why everyone looks away
          when you look at them.

          WALT
          Swell. Anything else?

          SUE
          Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin
          when they're yelled at or get into
          a confrontation. It's a cultural
          thing. It expresses embarrassment
          or insecurity, not that they're
          laughing at you.

          WALT
          Hey, Sue.

          SUE
          What?

          WALT
          You said you guys don't look you
          in the eye, but that guy keeps
          staring at me.
          Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man. The Old
          Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt.

          This is Kor Khue. He's the Lor

          Witch doctor?
          Sue smiles and nods.

          SUE
          Something like that. The Hmong
          hold their clan Shaman in very
          high regards.

          WALT
          Boo-ga, boo-ga.
          Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and
          translates to Walt.

          SUE
          Kor Khue is interested in you, he
          heard what you did. He says he
          would like to read you.

          WALT
          Huh?

          SUE
          He wants to read you. Tell you
          your soul. It'd be rude not to
          allow him this, it's a great
          honor.

          WALT
          Tell Kor to be my guest, fire
          away.
          Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and
          sits down across from Walt. He looks at Walt for a long
          time.
          Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to
          himself.
          Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly.
          As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction.

          SUE
          Kor Khue says that you think
          you've been disrespected. You do
          not live your life. Your food has
          no flavor. You are scared of your
          past.

          Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. The Shaman
          watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the
          head.
          Walt looks pale. He's been spooked good. He wipes sweat
          from his forehead.

          WALT
          Excuse me.
          Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. He takes

          Walt is stunned, it all adds up. Walt hasn't really
          lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let
          his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953.

          Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food,
          occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This
          corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong
          ladies.

          And the first person he sees across the room is Tao.

          WALT
          Oh great.

          SUE
          Well, look who's over there.

          What's-his-name who tried to steal

          My brother Tao.

          WALT
          Yeah, Toad.
          Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks
          over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans
          against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles.
          Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the
          dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the
          machine.
          He just can't help it.
          All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
          this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
          dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the
          headlights.

          WALT
          It was wobbly, but I fixed it.
          It's fine now, shouldn't wobble
          anymore.
          The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with
          their hands.
          Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from
          his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink.

          Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the
          interaction between the boys and girls.
          One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL
          stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her,
          but then looks away.
          The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her
          hair.
          Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
          They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not
          interested, she keeps looking at Tao.
          Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this
          wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to
          Walt.
          She smiles --

          Walt points across the room. He sways slightly.

          WALT
          But you? You just sit there and
          watch as Ding Dong and Click Clack
          and Charlie Chan walk away with
          what's-her-face. She likes you,
          you know.

          TAO
          Who?

          WALT
          She was standing over there,
          orange dress, twisting her hair
          and smiling at you.

          TAO
          You mean Wa Xam?
          Walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods.

          WALT
          Yeah, yeah. Anyways, she likes
          you, I know, I talked to her.
          Great girl, charming girl. Love
          her. I love Yum Yum. But you?
          You just watch her walk out the
          door with the Three Stooges. Why?
          Because you're a big fat pussy!
          Walt drains his drink.

          Walt empties the lawnmower bag as two elderly Hmong Women
          come over, each carrying a FLOWER BOUQUET.

          WALT
          No. No thanks. No more flowers.
          The elderly Hmong Women nod and speak rapid sentences in
          Hmong to Walt. He has no idea what they are saying.

          WALT
          No more. Please, keep your
          flowers.
          The Hmong women nod, smile and chatter away, ignoring
          Walt. They walk past him and set the BOUQUETS on his
          porch.

          WALT

          (DEFEATED)
          Okay, just put them on the porch.
          But that's it. No more.

          The doorbell rings. Walt answers, a Skillsaw in one
          hand.
          Standing on his doorstep are three Hmong women.

          WALT
          What now, Gee?
          Gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil.

          WALT
          No. Forget it. Stop bringing me
          stuff.
          Gee scolds Walt in Hmong.

          WALT
          No. I've had it.
          Gee opens the corner of the tinfoil. Walt looks at the
          food.

          Walt gets out of his pickup.

          WALT
          What now? What?
          Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He
          looks at Sue for the translation.

          SUE
          Tao is here to make amends, he's
          here to work for you.

          WALT
          No he's not.

          SUE
          Mother says that Tao dishonored
          the family and now he has to work
          off his debt. He'll start
          tomorrow morning.

          WALT
          No. The kid is useless, I don't
          even want him on my property. I
          thought we already went over that.

          SUE
          It's very important to my mother
          that you accept. It'd be an
          insult to refuse.

          WALT
          How is this all of a sudden turned
          around on me? The goddamned kid
          tries to steal my car and somehow
          I'm the bad guy if I don't accept?

          Tao interrupts from the sidewalk...

          TAO
          Come on, Sue. If he doesn't want
          to, let's just go.
          Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue
          in English, Vu in Hmong.

          SUE/VU
          Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!!
          Tao looks at the ground.
          A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong
          women's faces. Their expression begs Walt.
          Walt gazes back at Tao. Walt looks disgusted, he exhales
          loudly...

          WALT
          Fine. Great. Tomorrow.
          Walt walks past them and into his house.

          WALT
          Son of a bitch, I didn't think
          he'd show.
          Walt waves Tao over. Tao barely looks at Walt.

          spruce tree and count how many
          birds feed at the bird feeder.

          TAO
          Count the birds?

          Yeah, you can count? You slopes

          Tao stands in Walt's garden with his arms folded. Walt
          walks over to trim weeds around the garden fence.
          Walt doesn't even look at Tao. Finally...

          TAO
          You want me to do that?

          WALT
          No.

          TAO
          Why not?

          WALT
          I want it done right, that's why.

          Walt waters a flower bed. Tao comes over and stands
          there. Walt finishes watering before even looking at
          Tao.

          TAO
          What do you have for me today?
          You want me to watch paint dry or
          maybe count the clouds that pass

          Don't get flip with me, zipper

          window, it's been bugging me for

          While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door.
          Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder,
          trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
          Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.

          WALT
          Hey, moron.
          Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          I appreciate you're doing
          something on your own, but you're
          the only person I know dumb enough
          to get himself killed trimming
          tree branches.

          TAO
          What now?

          WALT
          You don't stand on the top step of
          a ladder and if you cut through
          that branch you're hacking away
          at, you'll end up kaput.
          Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is
          five feet below the branch he's almost severed.

          WALT
          Go grab the extension ladder from
          my garage and I'll show you how to
          do it right, zipper head.

          Tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs. Walt lights a
          cigarette, looks up in the tree and nods.

          WALT
          Looks good. Good job.
          Tao nods.

          Make sure you put the ladder back
          when you're done raking up the
          leaves.

          TAO
          I know. I will.
          Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the
          cooler and watches Tao rake.
          A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past
          Tao.
          Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.

          WALT
          This kid doesn't have a chance.
          The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just
          stands there, sipping his beer.
          The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at
          Walt.
          The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens.
          Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one
          eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
          several times as if firing. Bang -- bang -- bang.
          The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and
          lights another cigarette.
          Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole
          interaction from his yard.

          The doorbell rings.
          Walt opens his door. Tao stands there with his hands in
          his pockets. He's a bit apprehensive.

          TAO
          What do you know about faucets?
          Walt stares at him for a second and then laughs.

          Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it
          drips water at its base. Walt looks under the sink.

          WALT
          For the love of Pete.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          It must be a hundred degrees in
          here, turn on the fan.
          Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles
          and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off.
          Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head.

          The CEILING FAN and FAUCET are taken apart on the
          workbench. Walt reinstalls the diverter valve. Tao
          looks at all of Walt's tools.

          TAO
          Man, where did you get all this
          stuff?

          WALT
          What are you talking about?

          TAO
          All the tools and stuff.

          WALT
          Where the hell do you think I got
          them, Toad? This may come as a
          shock to a thief, but I actually
          bought the things I have with
          money I earned.

          TAO
          Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what
          I meant. There's just so much
          shit packed in here.

          WALT
          You need the right tool for the
          right job. Every single thing
          here has a purpose.

          Okay, what's this?
          Tao points to a tool.

          WALT
          Post hole digger.
          Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick
          succession, questioning Walt with his expression.

          WALT
          Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail
          punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife.
          Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile
          spacers.
          Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but
          he's too uncomfortable to speak up --

          WALT
          What?

          TAO
          I can't afford to buy all this
          stuff.

          WALT
          I didn't buy all this stuff at
          once, blockhead. I've lived here
          for fifty years. A man stays in
          one place long enough he tends to
          attract a decent set of tools.

          TAO
          Yeah, but...

          WALT
          Look, kid, I think I know where
          you're going with this. You don't
          need everything to maintain a
          house. I'm going to let you in on
          a little secret.
          Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE
          items in quick succession.

          WALT
          This is for you. Roll of duct
          tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of
          vise-grips. Any man who's worth a
          shit can do half his household
          jobs with these three things. In
          the odd chance that doesn't work
          out, you can borrow something.

          Okay. Cool.
          Walt coughs and covers his mouth. Both Tao and Walt see
          the spot of BLOOD in his hand.

          TAO
          What's with that?

          WALT
          What's with what?

          TAO
          The blood you just coughed up.
          That's not good, you should see a
          doctor.
          Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the
          screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.

          WALT
          So... what exactly was the deal
          with those guys out on my lawn
          that night? Who are they?

          TAO
          A gang. Hmong gangbangers.

          WALT
          I gathered that. What did they
          want with you?

          TAO
          They wanted to take me away
          because I blew my first
          initiation.

          WALT
          You joined up with those pukes?
          Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the
          hell did you do that?

          TAO
          I don't know. They were
          persuasive. My cousin's in the
          gang. They just talked me into it
          I guess.

          WALT
          Well, at least you're honest about
          it.
          A LONG SILENCE. Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan.

          Walt straps an old WESTINGHOUSE FREEZER onto a two-
          wheeled DOLLY. Walt attempts to pull the freezer
          upstairs.
          Walt strains with the heavy appliance. It's too much
          weight for Walt, but this doesn't stop him from heaving
          and pulling.
          Walt could have done this by himself when he was younger.

          I just need a little push. All
          the weight is up top, so you stay
          down and give me a little shove at
          each step.

          Let me take the top.

          Naw, I got it.

          No really, I'll take the top. It
          looks pretty heavy.

          WALT
          I'm not crippled. I got it.

          TAO
          If you don't let me take the top,
          I ain't helping. I'll go home.

          Him? Don't be crazy. He tried to
          steal my car.

          SUE
          And you spend time with him and
          you teach him how to fix things
          and you saved him from that fuck
          cousin of ours and...

          WALT
          Hey. Watch the language.

          SUE
          And you're a good man.

          WALT
          Hand me a beer, Dragon Lady.
          Sue hands him a beer and Walt pops the top.

          WALT
          So tell me the problem with Hmong
          boys again. I'm not completely
          clear.

          SUE
          Hmong girls slip in and out of the
          culture more easily. Date who we
          want, stay close to our mothers,
          but are able to keep a foot on
          each side of the fence. The boys
          fall through the cracks.

          WALT
          Why?

          SUE
          It's tough. The boys float
          around. The fathers belong in a
          totally different world and the
          boys have no one to turn to. Does
          that make sense?

          WALT
          Not sure. No.

          SUE
          The boys don't ask their fathers
          for advice, because over here,
          their fathers no longer have the
          answers.

          from there.

          boys go to jail.

          Walt and Tao spread mulch around Walt's vegetable plants.

          TAO
          You know, the Hmong consider
          gardening to be women's work.

          WALT
          Is that why I see you out in your
          garden all the time? Besides,
          zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong.

          TAO
          Funny.
          Walt lights a cigarette.

          TAO
          You should quit those. It's bad
          for you.

          want to do with your life?

          TAO

          WALT
          You've never thought about it?

          TAO
          Of course I have.

          WALT
          Well, while you're thinking about
          it, try not to stomp all over my
          chives, you dipshit.
          Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's
          chives.

          TAO
          Sorry.

          WALT
          Put some mulch around the
          cucumbers.
          Tao spreads more mulch.

          TAO
          I was thinking about sales, maybe.

          WALT
          My oldest son's a salesman. He
          sells cars.

          TAO
          Does he do well?

          WALT
          License to steal. I worked in a
          Ford plant for thirty years and my

          Maybe you should get a job and
          save instead of spreading mulch in
          my garden.

          TAO
          Maybe you could just pay me.

          and I have soft little girl hands.

          That's exactly the point. I know
          some guys in the trades, but you
          have to get your shit together.
          We have to man you up a bit.

          have known you'd come in, I was
          having such a pleasant day.

          out of a few bucks, give him the

          Kid, you shoulda just started with
          Hi' or Hello.'

          Okay. You owe me one, Walt.

          WALT
          I'll send you a fucking fruitcake
          at Christmas.

          Yeah, everybody seems to want that

          What are you gonna put all your

          tosses it to Tao.

          WALT
          You'll need this.
          Walt then tosses Tao a utility knife holder.

          WALT
          And you'll need that. Now where
          the hell do they hide the hardware
          holders?

          TAO
          I can't afford any of this.

          WALT
          I'll get it, but you're paying me
          back with your first check.

          Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao.

          WALT
          And you need this too. That
          should about do it.

          TAO
          Not to bitch, but won't I be
          needing some tools?

          WALT
          Tools I got, but I ain't loaning
          you my tool belt. You can buy
          tools as you go.

          TAO
          I appreciate all this.

          WALT
          Aw, forget it.

          TAO
          No, I really do. Thank you.
          Walt sticks out his jaw and looks Tao straight in the
          eye. Tao doesn't know what to expect.
          A PAUSE. Walt puts out his HAND to Tao. Tao extends his
          and they SHAKE HANDS.
          It's really quite a moment for both of them.

          Tao gets off the bus, his tool belt over his shoulder.
          Tao looks tired after working, but content. He walks
          past an abandoned lot.
          The tricked-out Honda pulls up and stops. Smokie, Spider
          and company get out. Tao looks nervous, but remains
          calm.

          TAO
          What now?

          SPIDER

          about that.

          SPIDER
          So it's true? You got a job.

          TAO
          Come on, what do you guys want
          with me?

          SMOKIE
          Jesus Christ, Tao. What do you
          think? I've been sooooo easy on
          you, but I can't just go on like
          nothing happened.

          TAO
          You can't just leave me alone?

          SMOKIE
          Afraid not.
          The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao kicks and struggles as
          they yank away his tool belt.

          TAO
          Keep your hands off my stuff.

          SMOKIE
          Your stuff? You and everything
          you have is mine. I own you.
          Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it
          against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can't
          destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.

          SMOKIE
          You can't just walk away from us,
          Tao. It looks bad. It makes me
          look bad.
          Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales...

          SMOKIE
          What's the phrase I'm looking for?
          Oh yeah, I need to save face.'
          Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit
          CIGARETTE into Tao's cheek.
          Tao screams as his flesh burns.

          WALT
          Hey there.
          Tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction.

          TAO
          Hey, I gotta run.

          WALT
          Wait a minute. Where have you
          been, I haven't seen you in days?

          TAO
          Busy.
          Walt squints at Tao. He steps closer. Tao looks away.
          Walt tilts Tao's head up, he sees the burn.

          WALT
          What in the hell happened to you?

          TAO
          Don't worry about it.

          WALT
          Don't worry about it? Look at
          your goddamned face!

          I said don't worry about it. It's
          not your problem.
          Walt looks at the ground and spits.

          WALT
          When?

          TAO
          Couple days ago. Grabbed me after
          I got off the bus coming home from
          work.

          WALT

          No, Walt, I can manage. I don't
          want you doing anything.
          Walt is angry, but eventually nods at Tao.

          WALT
          Alright. You need any other tools
          for work?

          TAO
          I could use a roofing hammer.

          carefully writes Tao Vang Lor in black ink on the face
          of his smashed-up tape measure. He puts it back into the
          tool belt and grabs another tool to label.

          Walt watches as Spider and another Hmong gangbanger step
          out of the rundown duplex, get in their Honda and drive
          off.

          WALT
          That's the last of them.

          tosses him off the front porch onto the front sidewalk.
          Smokie is stunned. Walt kicks him hard in the ribs.

          SMOKIE
          How the fuck did you get here?!

          WALT
          You aren't that hard to track
          down.
          Walt boots him again. Smokie curls up in the fetal
          position.

          SMOKIE
          What do you want?
          Walt kicks him a second time.

          WALT
          I came to give you a chance.
          SOMETHING comes out of the shadows under the porch.
          Walt swings the barrel of the big Colt .45 at the
          movement.
          It's a cat. Walt puts his pistol away. Smokie exhales.

          WALT
          It's just you and me. Nobody
          knows or has to know I was here.
          You lay off Tao. Tell your guys
          he ain't worth it or whatever the
          hell you want. You don't talk to
          him, you don't go near him. This
          is your one chance. You lay off
          and no one will ever be the wiser.
          Smokie says nothing.

          WALT
          I'll take that as a yes. I don't
          want to come back here. But if I
          do, believe me, it'll be goddamned

          Walt gets to the door and drops his keys. When he bends
          down to pick them up, you can really tell he's sore and
          hurting.

          made.

          Is this Hmoog or Laab?

          SUE

          doesn't ask you out soon, I will.

          follows his gaze.

          It's a miracle no one was killed.

          WALT
          They aimed high.
          Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head
          level on the walls.

          speak faster. He looks at Walt and shakes his head no.

          This is exactly what I didn't

          Maybe one of her friends called
          and she just changed plans.

          Sue staggers into Vu's arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her
          mother and sobs.
          Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at
          him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao.
          Walt is destroyed. He steps outside into the dark.

          Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair
          and CRIES. He tries to stop and cries harder.
          It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years. He
          wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself.
          He lets it all out. Daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs
          his old dog as he bawls.

          Walt sits, red-eyed. He's done crying. Family photo
          albums are scattered around.
          Father Janovich knocks and eases open the front door.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Mr. Kowalski, are you in here?

          WALT
          Come on in.
          Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Are you okay?
          Walt nods.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          The police finally left. No one
          is talking. One thing about the
          Hmong, they keep their mouths
          shut.

          WALT
          I've noticed that.
          Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through
          it. Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies.

          WALT
          You know, there's no way that Tao
          or Sue are gonna have any peace if
          these gang guys don't go away. Go
          away forever. You know it as well
          as I do.

          They took Sue to the hospital.
          She's scared. They're all scared.

          WALT
          I'm not.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I know that. Believe me, they all
          know that. Tao especially. He's
          sitting out there staring at your
          front door. You know what he
          expects, Mr. Kowalski.

          WALT
          Yeah, well what would you do if
          you were me? If you were Tao?
          What would you do?
          Father Janovich shakes his head.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I know what I'd do if I was you,
          or at least what you think you
          should do. If I was Tao I guess
          I'd want vengeance. I'd want to
          stand shoulder to shoulder with
          you and kill those guys.

          WALT
          And you?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          What would I do? I'd come over
          here and talk to you I guess. I
          know you're close with these
          people, but this pisses me off
          too, Mr. Kowalski.
          Walt nods.

          away from what's happened, Tao.

          TAO
          No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not
          you. This is going to end, today.
          Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          In Korea, October, 1952. We were
          sent up to sweep a Chink machine
          gun nest that had carved us up
          pretty bad. I was the only one
          who came back... I received the
          Silver Star. I want you to have
          it.

          TAO
          Why?

          WALT
          When we went up that hill, we knew
          it was ten to one against us, but
          we went anyway. This trouble now,
          it's similar. We're walking right
          into it. We might not be coming
          home tonight.

          TAO
          The hell we won't. We're going to
          roll in there and tear ass.

          WALT
          Don't be a fool, these guys are
          waiting for that exact reaction.
          Tao is quiet for a minute.

          Go get the Silver Star. It's in a

          the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it.
          Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely.

          him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud

          CLICK.
          Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of
          course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws
          things.

          fuck, or I will kill you when I

          Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength
          and authority which startles Tao.

          scared kid when he tries to give
          up. A dumb, scared, little gook,

          later.

          TAO
          No! Let me out!!
          Tao pounds on the door.

          WALT
          You've come a long way. I'm proud
          to call you a friend. You have
          your whole life ahead of you,
          whereas this is what I do. I
          finish things. You'd just get in
          the way. Sorry.
          Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his
          cellar.
          Tao howls to be let out.

          Walt walks out his front door with Daisy on her leash.
          He walks over to Tao's house.
          Phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at Walt. She yells
          in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her.

          WALT
          Aw, pipe down, you hag.

          You're an evil man. I've seen
          your kind before. Back home,
          white soldiers came to our
          villages and filled our young
          men's minds with ideas of glory.
          Then you'd lead them away to their
          deaths.
          Walt, of course, has no idea what she said.

          WALT
          Fine, I hate you too.

          Walt holds out the DOG LEASH to Phong. She looks down at
          Daisy and back at Walt. She lashes out again in Hmong.

          WALT
          I need you to watch my dog.
          Walt holds the leash closer. Phong folds her arms in
          defiance. Walt exhales loudly.
          Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips
          the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow
          him.

          WALT
          Her name is Daisy.
          Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy. He
          scratches her belly.

          WALT
          You take it easy, old gal. You
          good old girl.
          Walt gets up and walks away without looking back.
          Phong is stunned; she is silent for once.

          Beer and a shot, Walt?

          WALT
          I think I'll have something
          different.
          Walt looks at the liquor display. At the pinnacle of
          bottles sits a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.

          WALT

          Blue Label.

          I'm sure. This is too good not to

          It's Walt. The key to my front
          door is under the ceramic turtle.
          Open the door and go let your
          brother out of the cellar. I have
          to go.
          The line goes dead as Walt hangs up. Sue jumps up out of
          bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs.
          Phong blocks her path. Phong grabs Sue by the arms.

          Father Janovich paces back and forth. The SQUAD CAR
          pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid
          of all day.

          OFFICER
          Sorry, Father, we have to go.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'm telling you. If we're not
          here, there will be bloodshed.

          OFFICER
          We've been here for hours. We
          can't afford to anchor a unit to
          one location.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'm begging you to stay.

          OFFICER
          I just got word from my Sergeant,
          we're pulling the plug.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'm staying.

          OFFICER
          No you aren't. My orders are
          specific. You came with us,
          you're leaving with us.
          Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting
          into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off.
          Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams
          the door. He looks at the duplex. It's a total eyesore.

          WALT

          Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the
          duplex.
          Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out
          at Walt from various doorways and windows.

          WALT
          Is that all you swamp rats or is
          there more vermin scurrying in the
          shadows?
          Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch.
          Smokie smiles at Walt. Walt spits on the ground.

          SMOKIE
          I wasn't sure that you'd...

          WALT
          Shut up, gook. I'm not here to
          listen to one goddamned syllable
          of what a shrimp-dicked little
          baby midget like you has to say.
          Spider pulls his PISTOL.

          WALT
          That's right, boy. Defend your
          boyfriend after he or you or
          whoever rapes a member of your
          family. Your own blood, for
          Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull
          your pistols, just like a bunch of
          ridiculous miniature toy cowboys.
          Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their
          guns.

          WALT
          You have no honor. You're the
          scum of the earth and when you're
          gone, do you think anyone will
          care? No one will mourn. You
          won't be missed.
          All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of
          fear.

          SMOKIE
          Where's Tao, old man? He too
          scared to come and stick up for

          Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth. Even this
          slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS
          around.
          Walt laughs.

          WALT
          You boys are a little bit jumpy.

          SPIDER
          You watch it, old man.

          WALT
          No, I think you'd better watch it.

          Walt Kowalski once said to me I
          didn't know anything about life or
          death because I was an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who held the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promised them eternity.' Walt
          definitely had no problem calling
          it like he saw it.' But Walt was
          right. I knew really nothing
          about life or death until I got to

               MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA 
               PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and 
               hearing.

               DISSOLVE OUT.

               DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and 
               then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business 
               jumble.

               CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the 
               steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it 
               passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.

               THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement 
               across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA 
               now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. 
               Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE 
               PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.

               At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who 
               emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish 
               who she is.

               THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear 
               her saying to Senf:

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam Grusinskaya will not want her 
                         car.

               This line is only just above the general clatter of action 
               but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- 
               and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going 
               towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, 
               saying:

                                     VOICE
                         Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.

               The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a 
               section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in 
               profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of 
               people drinking before their lunch.

               We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, 
               looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, 
               is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at 
               the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his 
               face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to 
               her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a 
               chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at 
               his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA 
               and he moves out towards the lobby.

               BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the 
               main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of 
               waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A 
               string orchestra is playing.

               Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous 
               Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important 
               to a table.

               THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just 
               as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel 
               now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:

                                     MAITRE D'HOTEL
                         Where is that gentleman's soup?

               The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to 
               argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to 
               another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:

                                     WAITER
                         Where's that soup?

               Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, 
               into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's 
               counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that 
               moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket 
               forward.

                                     BOY
                         Quick -- come on -- come on...

               The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception 
               of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: "I'll 
               slap you on the mouth." At the same time he is pulling over 
               a cauldron of soup.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small 
               cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and 
               hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- 
               She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has 
               filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down 
               the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.

               THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. 
               Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette 
               carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A 
               horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, 
               he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to 
               tear the place down.

                                     WAITER
                              (anxious voice)
                         Yes.

                                     PREYSING
                              (grimly)
                         Cold.

                                     VOICE
                              (near Preysing's elbow)
                         Mr. Preysing...

                                     PREYSING
                              (in same voice)
                         Yes...

                                     BELLBOY
                         Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --

               Preysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -- 
               He walks out through the door...

                                                     DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO:

               Between two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA 
               TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl.

               Bellboy is with Preysing.

                                     BELLBOY
                         Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his 
                         call.

                                     GIRL
                         Yes, Mr. Preysing --

               Preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of 
               switchboard.

                                     GIRL
                              (nervously)
                         They've gone -- Just a moment, sir...

                                     PREYSING
                              (to boy)
                         You told me it was on -- you said 
                         the call was through.
                              (he waits irritably)

                                     SECOND GIRL
                              (to first)
                         Who's in number three?

                                     FIRST GIRL
                         Senf -- the hall porter.
                              (Girl looks off at...)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SENF IN TELEPHONE BOOTH

                                     SENF
                         Yes, it's Senf, the head porter, 
                         Grand Hotel... Are you at the 
                         Clinic?,... How's my wife?,... Is 
                         she in pain?,... Isn't the child 
                         coming soon?,... Patience! It's easy 
                         for you to talk... Get away?,... No, 
                         I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's 
                         like being in jail. Oh, I hope the 
                         child comes along all right.

               At the conclusion of Senf's speech, CAMERA MOVES TO NEXT 
               BOOTH. Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from 
               desk. He enters booth and commences conversation:

                                     PREYSING
                         Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off 
                         the wire... No... I was talking to 
                         Fredersdorf... What?,... Oh... 
                         Hello!... Is that you dear?... How 
                         is everything at home?... What do 
                         you hear from the factory?... No... 
                         How are the children?... I left my 
                         shaving set at home... Yes, is your 
                         father there?... Hello, father?... 
                         Our stock has gone down twenty-three 
                         points. If our merger with the Saxonia 
                         doesn't go through -- I don't know 
                         what we can do... Hello, hello... 
                         yes, papa. Rely on me -- everything 
                         depends on Manchester... If they 
                         refuse to come in -- well, we will 
                         be in bad shape... no... Rely on me, 
                         I'll make it go through -- I'll make 
                         it go through... Waiting?... Yes, 
                         I'm still speaking...

               THE CAMERA THEN PANS TO Suzette. Suzette is already in the 
               booth and she is waiting for Mr. Meierheim to come on.

                                     SUZETTE
                              (starting to speak)
                         Hello, Mr. Meierheim?... Is that, 
                         Mr. Meierheim?... This is Suzette... 
                         Suzette, Madam Grusinskaya's maid... 
                         No... Madam Grusinskaya will not go 
                         to the rehearsal... No... Madam is 
                         in a terrible state, she didn't sleep 
                         all night -- She's very tired... No, 
                         I'm speaking from a booth -- I didn't 
                         want to speak in front of her... I 
                         gave her a tablet of veronal... She's 
                         sleeping now... You had better come 
                         to the hotel, I'm afraid...

               PAN TO BARON just entering booth. He is lighting a cigarette. 
               (receiver down - trick)

                                     BARON
                              (speaking into 
                              telephone)
                         Baron Gaigern speaking. Yes, Baron 
                         Gaigern himself. Where are you?,... 
                         Good... No -- first, I need money. I 
                         need it right now. I have to make a 
                         showing... That's my business. I 
                         hope to do it tonight... at the 
                         theatre or after the show... But 
                         money -- for the hotel bill, for 
                         tips... I don't need advice, I need 
                         money!... Now, listen...

               PAN TO KRINGELEIN - booth.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Who is that, This is... Hello, 
                         hello!... Who is that... Heinrich? 
                         This is Kringelein. Hello, Heinrich. 
                         This is Otto Kringelein. Hello! Can 
                         you hear me?... I've got to speak 
                         very quickly. Every minute costs two 
                         marks ninety... What?... Otto 
                         Kringelein! Yes, I'm in Berlin, 
                         staying at the best hotel, the Grand 
                         Hotel... No, don't you understand? I 
                         want to explain, but I must do so 
                         quickly, it costs so much. Please 
                         don't interrupt me -- hello? Hello! 
                         Listen! You know that will I made 
                         before my operation? I gave it to 
                         you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy 
                         it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin 
                         to see a great specialist about that 
                         old trouble of mine... It's pretty 
                         bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I 
                         can't live much longer.
                              (louder)
                         I haven't long to live! That's what's 
                         the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on 
                         the line? No, it isn't nice to be 
                         told a thing like that. All sorts of 
                         things run through your head. I am 
                         going to stay here in Berlin. I am 
                         never coming back to Fredersdorf. 
                         Never! I want to get something out 
                         of life, too. You plague, and bother, 
                         and save -- and all of a sudden you 
                         are dead. Heinrich... You don't say 
                         anything. I am in the Grand Hotel, 
                         do you understand, the most expensive 
                         hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a 
                         room here. The very best people stay 
                         here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I 
                         saw him -- not five minutes after I 
                         was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell 
                         him exactly what I think of him. 
                         Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all 
                         my savings; my life insurance, too; 
                         I cashed in all my policies, the 
                         sick benefit fund, the old age 
                         pension, the unemployment insurance, 
                         the burial fund and everything... 
                         What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich. 
                         I have to hang up now. I have to pay 
                         three times overcharge. Just think, 
                         Heinrich! There's music here all day 
                         long. And in the evening, they go 
                         around in full dress... Yes, sometimes 
                         I have pain, but I can stand it. 
                         Everything is frightfully expensive 
                         here. You can imagine, the Grand 
                         Hotel... What? Time's up...

               Near the conclusion of Kringelein's speech, we see the Doctor 
               approaching through Kringelein's booth. He is looking down 
               at something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         last night --

               Shooting directly on swinging door -- normal crowd action. 
               Tea-dansant at this hour is daily rendezvous for smart demi-
               mondaines, gigolos, out-of-town travelers, etc. -- These 
               types indicated.

               In the distance we hear music.

                                                      DISSOLVE SUDDENLY TO:

               YELLOWROOM - NEAR SHOT OF BAND

               This same music is being played by the Eastman Jazz Band in 
               the Yellow Room of the hotel.

               THE CAMERA does not wait but backs down the room. It is the 
               hour of the tea-dansant.

               As the CAMERA IS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM which is in reality 
               the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron -- 
               he proceeds through the door of the restaurant --

               Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the 
               restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be 
               necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor 
               upstairs -- giving sense of distance.

               The Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds 
               through the lobby as if on a mission. He glances at a pretty 
               woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is 
               seated in his chair, not far from the desk. He enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FLORIST SHOP

               Pretty girl is there, she has seen him coming. She turns 
               from the door and hands him a box of orchids, already tied 
               in ribbon.

                                     BARON
                         Good little girl -- nice ones?

                         Yes, Baron.

               The Baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission; he 
               leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LOBBY

               In the lobby we pick up the Baron leaving the florists with 
               small box of flowers -- he crosses quickly to Senf's desk.

               SHOT OVER SENF'S HEAD as the Baron puts the flowers down. 
               Senf is busy.

               The Baron is whistling gaily -- tapping his fingers on the 
               flower box -- he is good-natured and patient.

                                     SENF

                         Is that for me?

                                     CLERK
                         No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to 
                         be brought.

                         brought.

               Boy leaves. We hear his voice out of scene at the door.

                         Madam Grusinskaya's car... to be

                              (amiably)
                         Good evening. Will you send these up 
                         to Madam Grusinskaya?

                                     SENF
                         Yes, Baron.
                              (he hands the box of 
                              flowers to the clerk)
                         Madam Grusinskaya.

               Clerk hands box to bellboy.

                         Oh yes, Baron --
                              (to Clerk)
                         Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam 
                         Grusinskaya.

               Telephone rings again. Clerk picks it up.

                                     SENF
                              (to Clerk)
                         For me?

                              (at telephone -- shakes 
                              his head)
                         No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not 
                         to be brought.

                                     SENF
                              (to boy)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be 
                         brought.

               The Clerk hands Senf the tickets which Senf hands to the 
               Baron.

                                     BARON
                         Charge them...

               As the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly 
               as he hears the voice of Pimenov, who has arrived apparently 
               from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (to Senf)
                         Good evening -- my key -- one sixty-
                         eight.

                                     BARON
                         Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Oh -- good evening, Baron.

                                     BARON
                         How's the beautiful lady?

                                     PIMENOV
                         Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the 
                         truth, Baron -- tonight we are a 
                         little bit nervous. Were you at the 
                         theatre last night?

                                     BARON
                         Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya 
                         dances.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Well -- last night was not so good.

                                     BARON
                         I thought she was splendid!

                                     PIMENOV
                         Yes -- but the audience.

               At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little 
               Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the Clerk. The 
               Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife.

                                     CLERK
                              (to Japanese)
                         The parquot loges are behind the 
                         parquet chairs.

                                     JAPANESE
                         Then they've put me back and I want 
                         to be up in front. How is that, chairs 
                         in front of loges?

               Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time.

                                     SENF
                         The train leaves at seven-thirty, 
                         Madam. That is the only through train -- 
                         the dining car goes along.

               The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese 
               speaks volubly to his wife.

                                     BARON
                              (sarcastically)
                         It's always so quiet here.

                                     PIMENOV
                         If you occupied the room next to 
                         Madam Grusinskaya, you would 
                         appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.

                                     BARON
                         My dear sir, I would gladly change 
                         rooms with you.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (effeminately)
                         No doubt you would, Baron. But do 
                         you know, I'm quite indispensable to 
                         her. I'm her ballet master and her 
                         nurse. I hardly belong to myself 
                         anymore. But, there you are, it's 
                         Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring 
                         her.

               At that moment, Zinnowitz pushes past them.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Pardon me.
                              (addressing Senf)
                         Is Mr. Preysing in -- I am Doctor 
                         Zinnowitz.

                                     SENF
                              (to bellboy)

               Preysing steps quickly into scene.

                         Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Have I kept you waiting?

                                     PREYSING
                         Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from 
                         Manchester.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         No news yet?

                                     PREYSING
                         No. No word.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Everything depends on the Manchester 
                         merger.

                                     PREYSING
                         I know -- I know.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as 
                         your lawyer I made it my business to 
                         broach the matter ---

               As they begin to move out of scene, Zinnowitz calls back to 
               Senf.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         I'm expecting a young woman -- a 
                         stenographer -- she will ask for Mr. 
                         Preysing. Ask her to wait.

                                     SENF
                         Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz.

               As they move out of scene, telephone bell goes.

                                     SENF
                              (to Clerk)
                         For me?

                                     CLERK
                         No -- letters to two-eighty.

                                     SENF
                              (to Clerk)
                         If a young woman, a stenographer, -- 
                         etc.

               This just covers the scene.

               The Baron and Pimenov are laughing at something one of them 
               has said which brings our attention to them again.

               At that moment the Doctor enters the scene.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Any letters?

                                     SENF
                         No, Doctor.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Telegrams?

                                     SENF
                         No, Doctor.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Anyone asked for me?

                                     SENF
                         Nobody, Doctor.

               The Doctor turns slowly away, taking out a cigarette with 
               his one hand.

                                     BARON
                              (glancing at Doctor)
                         The war.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (looking up from his 
                              letter -- glances 
                              off at the doctor)
                         That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You 
                         know him?

                                     BARON
                         Yes -- He always seems to be waiting 
                         for something -- and nothing ever 
                         comes.

                                     PIMENOV
                         The war dropped him here and forgot 
                         him.

                                     BARON
                              (beams)
                         Yes, I was in the war.

               CUT IN: FLASH OF DOCTOR --

               He turns as he hears the Baron say this.

               He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the Baron... 
               then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get 
               Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the reception 
               desk, which adjoins that of Senf's.

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         Please -- please pay some attention 
                         to me -- I have no time.

               Pan back to desk:

                                     ROHNA
                              (engaged with a lady 
                              and gentleman, who 
                              have just arrived)
                         If you will wait one moment, sir.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I 
                         waited three days before I got a 
                         room at all and what a room that is.

                                     ROHNA
                         It's a very nice room and inexpensive, 
                         sir.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Did I say I wanted a cheap room to 
                         live in -- when I came here did I 
                         ask for a cheap room? Did I?

               Rohna, sensing a scene with this strange dirty little 
               gentleman, looks furtively around for the manager.

                                     ROHNA
                         Just one moment, sir.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every 
                         day is precious -- every hour -- 
                         Every minute.

               Second Clerk is looking straight at him.

               Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and 
               proceeds:

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I came here because I wanted to live 
                         here, two weeks, maybe three -- God 
                         only knows -- I've told you I'll pay -- 
                         I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired -- 
                         I'm ill -- I can't wait.

               As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is 
               watching.

               Assistant Manager enters.

                                     ASSISTANT MANAGER
                         Has the gentleman a complaint?

               Rohna and Kringelein speak together.

                                     ROHNA
                         The gentleman is dissatisfied with 
                         room number five fifty-nine.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I certainly have a complaint -- and 
                         a fair one.

               He senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov 
               enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The 
               bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and 
               looks up.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (continuing)
                         I came here from a long distance to 
                         stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a 
                         room -- a big room -- like you would 
                         give General Director Preysing -- 
                         I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can 
                         pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you 
                         give him a little room, way up in 
                         the corner with the hot water pipes 
                         going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
                              (he bangs at the desk 
                              with his fist)

                                     DOCTOR
                         This gentleman can have my room.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (turning)
                         Oh!

                                     DOCTOR
                         Send his bags up to my room.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- but -- I --

                                     DOCTOR
                         You're tired. I can see that.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have 
                         been ill...

                                     DOCTOR
                         You are ill.

               During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna 
               quietly. The manager how turns.

                                     MANAGER
                         Mr. Kringelein will take room number 
                         one-seventy-six, one of our most 
                         expensive rooms. It is large and on 
                         the front with bath.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (subdued -- exhausted --)
                         Does that mean that the bath is my 
                         own? --- Private?

                                     MANAGER
                         Certainly, sir.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. 
                         That's what I want -- a large room 
                         on the front with a private bath -- 
                         Yes, that's what I want. I can pay 
                         now if you like.

               He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract 
               money.

                                     DOCTOR
                         That will not be necessary.

               The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to 
               the new room.

               Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has 
               noticed the money, stoops to pick it up.

               In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat.

               Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his 
               sleeve.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     BARON
                              (amused)
                         Not at all, sir.
                              (he beams)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (finding a friendly 
                              face)
                         Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- 
                         from Fredersdorf.

                                     BARON
                         I'm Baron von Gaigern.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, a Baron!
                              (he is impressed)

               Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly 
               popular.

                                     BARON
                         And this is Doctor Otternschlag.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (turning to Doctor)
                         Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- 
                         I am --

                                     DOCTOR
                         I know -- I know -- when a man's 
                         collar is an inch too big for him -- 
                         I know he is ill.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
                              (his finger goes 
                              nervously to his 
                              collar)

               Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out.

               At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where 
               he has bought the evening papers.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Well, Baron -- I must go and dress.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to doctor)
                         Is this gentleman a Baron, too?

                                     PIMENOV
                              (laughing)
                         Unfortunately no.

               The Manager comes into scene.

                                     MANAGER
                         Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Again?

                                     MANAGER
                         Please.

               Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him.

               At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Have you a minute now?

                                     BARON
                         No -- I told you not to come in this 
                         lobby.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Time's getting short.

                                     BARON
                         I've told you a hundred times not to 
                         speak to me with a cigarette in your 
                         mouth.

               Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still 
               holds it in his hand.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         I want to speak --

                                     BARON
                         Not now.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Yes, sir.

               The Baron leaves.

               General moving off, towards elevator, of Baron, Pimenov, 
               Kringelein and the Doctor.

               SENF'S DESK

               On another shot, shooting profile onto Senf's desk, bring in 
               Flaemmchen. Flaemmchen enters. Her back to CAMERA.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (we hear her ask)
                         Mr. Preysing.

                                     SENF
                         Will you wait please.

                                     CLERK
                         The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. 
                         Preysing telephoned.

                                     SENF
                         Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Thanks --
                              (calling off to 
                              elevator)
                         Heigh! -- Wait!

               She crosses to elevator.

               THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO ELEVATOR 
               WITH HER.

               As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns 
               around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking 
               down at her. The look on her face is the look we often see 
               on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed.

               NOTE: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen.

               The lift ascends.

               UPPER CORRIDOR

               Flaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for 
               the numbers. She moves out of scene.

               The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move 
               straight down the hall.

               Pimenov is chatting volubly.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (to Baron)
                         Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she 
                         receive anyone. She can't -- theatre, 
                         trains, hotels -- hotels, trains 
                         theatre.

               We see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr. 
               Preysing's room.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (continuing)
                         I must go and dress -- she'll be 
                         waking up and calling for me.

               He proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of 
               his ballet.

               At that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to 
               Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there 
               is an amusing exchange of glances between them.

               Flaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice.

                                     PREYSING'S VOICE
                         Come in.

               She opens the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PREYSING'S ROOM

               Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He 
               stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel.

               He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him 
               very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her.

                                     PREYSING
                         What...! --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I'm the stenographer.

                                     PREYSING
                         Then you will please wait outside.

               He is very much affronted.

               Flaemmchen, who has seen many large gentlemen in the 
               altogether --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (lightly)
                         Don't hurry -- take your time.

               She goes out of the room and shuts the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UPPER CORRIDOR

               Flaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room.

               Baron loitering in the hall. (Whistling as outlined). Baron 
               approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that 
               Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues 
               whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: 
               "Are you mad?"

                                     BARON
                         Like dancing?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Not with strangers.

               Baron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is 
               going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to 
               keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes 
               out.

                                     BARON
                              (turning to Flaemmchen)
                         Never?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're a fool!

                                     BARON
                         Yes, I am rather.

               He glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets.

               She glances impatiently at her watch.

                                     BARON
                         He must be very nice.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Who?

                                     BARON
                              (gallantly)
                         Whoever is keeping you waiting.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (indicating Preysing's 
                              door)
                         Have you seen it?

                                     BARON
                         Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- 
                         really? That?
                              (indicating Preysing's 
                              door)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         That.

                                     BARON
                              (with meaning)
                         You?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (quickly)
                         Oh -- work!!

                                     BARON
                              (with meaning)
                         Oh!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Dictation.
                              (she twittles her 
                              fingers)
                         You know...

                                     BARON
                         Oh... poor child. If you were free, 
                         I'd ask you to come and have some 
                         tea -- but --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Tea would spoil my dinner.
                              (lightly)
                         One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil 
                         it.

                                     BARON
                         Reducing?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (she turns invitingly)
                         No -- why? -- should I?

                                     BARON
                         Lord no -- charming -- but why one 
                         meal a day?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (laughing in his face)
                         Money -- Ever heard of it?

                                     BARON
                         Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are 
                         a...
                              (moves fingers)
                         ...a stenographer. Don't little 
                         stenographers earn little pennies?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Very little.

                                     BARON
                         Too bad.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Did you ever see a stenographer with 
                         a decent frock on? -- One that she'd 
                         bought herself?

                                     BARON
                         Poor child --
                              (enthusiastically)
                         I wish I were free tonight -- we 
                         could --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (with invitation)
                         Aren't you?

                                     BARON
                              (quickly)
                         What?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Free --

                                     BARON
                              (glancing up passage)
                         Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow 
                         though.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?

                                     BARON
                         Shall we say five o'clock -- 
                         downstairs?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Where downstairs?

                                     BARON
                         Yellow Room where they dance --
                              (business)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're very funny --

                                     BARON
                              (with great meaning)
                         Yes? -- Tomorrow?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Of course.

                                     BARON
                         Really?

               Flaemmchen laughs at him.

                                     BARON
                         We'll dance.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (slowly)
                         All right. We'll dance.

               At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his 
               doorway at the end of the passage.

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         Baron -- Oh, Baron!

               The Baron turns and looks off at ---

               KRINGELEIN

               Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant. He 
               waves.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         If I could trouble the Baron to come 
                         and see this beautiful room. I have 
                         ordered champagne. Perhaps the 
                         Baroness could join us.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               FLAEMMCHEN, BARON AND KRINGELEIN

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!
                              (to Baron and 
                              Flaemmchen)
                         We are having caviar -- it's expensive 
                         but that makes no difference -- I 
                         see the Baroness is laughing.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Have caviar if you like, but it tastes 
                         like herring to me.

               At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette 
               comes out into the hall.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh!

               By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room. The 
               Baron turns back for a moment.

                                     BARON
                              (calling back quietly 
                              to Suzette)
                         Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!

               Suzette turns back into the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains are 
               drawn -- room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of 
               silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow 
               Room below.

               In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers 
               which she has been mending.

               She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly 
               and looks off dramatically at...

               GRUSINSKAYA

               Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe, 
               on the chaise-lounge.

               Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand 
               which is outside the robe moves.

               The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards 
               Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to the 
               chaise-lounge and is looking down.

               Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the ceiling 
               and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.

                                     SUZETTE'S VOICE
                              (quietly and reverently -- 
                              almost a whisper)
                         Madam has slept well.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         No, I have been awake -- thinking -- 
                         thinking.

                                     SUZETTE'S VOICE
                         It is time for the performance.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The performance?

                                     SUZETTE
                         It is time.

               Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly 
               upright --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Always the performance -- every day 
                         the performance -- time for the 
                         performance.
                              (she pauses and droops 
                              suddenly)
                         I think, Suzette, I have never been 
                         so tired in my life.
                              (she takes the bottle 
                              of veronal which is 
                              nearby)
                         Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
                              (laughs a little)

                                     SUZETTE
                              (speaking into 
                              telephone)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be 
                         brought.

               While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of 
               a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to 
               the floor and although there is only one other woman in the 
               room -- she holds the robe around her.

               She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face, running her 
               fingers through her hair. She gently massages under her eyes 
               and the CAMERA sees Grusinskaya for the first time.

               There is silence in the room -- neither of the women speak.

               Suzette gets madam's clothes ready. She crosses, puts the 
               case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them.

               Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead silence.

               Suzette kneels as if to put Madam's stockings on for her. 
               Grusinskaya pulls her foot away.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I can't dance tonight --

                                     SUZETTE
                         It will pass -- it will pass -- come.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Let us cancel the engagement.

                                     SUZETTE
                         But, Madam. cannot do that.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Now is the time to cancel to stop 
                         entirely. I feel it -- everything 
                         tells me -- enough -- enough.

               She leans forward against the dressing-table and her hands 
               unconsciously touch the pearls.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (very quietly)
                         The peals are cold -- everything is 
                         cold -- finished -- it seems so far 
                         away -- so threadbare -- the Russians -- 
                         St. Petersburg -- the Imperial Court -- 
                         the Grand Duke Sergei --
                              (long pause as though 
                              she were reliving 
                              incidents of the 
                              past)
                         -- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya -- 
                         it's all gone.

               She throws the pearls away, down upon the floor.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they 
                         were to break --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The pearls won't break -- they hold 
                         together and bring me bad luck ---- 
                         I hate them!

               Suzette crosses replacing the pearls.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- 
                         I think perhaps they are from the 
                         same young man -- he is at the end 
                         of the corridor -- tall -- he walks 
                         like a soldier -- Madam must have 
                         noticed how often he is in the 
                         elevator with us. Last night for 
                         instance --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- 
                         quiet.

               Grusinskaya's eyes are looking off into space -- she is away 
               in Russia -- she does not look --

               Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Send it away -- I shan't need it.

               There is a knock at the door -- a certain kind of knock.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Come in.

               She picks up the telephone and as she does so Pimenov enters. 
               Suzette quickly gives Pimenov a signal that there is trouble. 
               As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya speak 
               into telephone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (authoritatively)
                         Madam Grusinskaya will not require 
                         her car -- no -- she will not be 
                         going to the theatre.
                              (she turns)

               Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will 
               deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood.

               She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing-
               table and sits.

                                     PIMENOV
                         It is time for the performance.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (under her breath)
                         The performance -- the performance -- 
                         the performance.
                              (during this scene 
                              the orchids fall to 
                              the floor)

               It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just 
               temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very 
               near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with 
               her a revulsion against the word performance.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (tenderly -- as he 
                              touches her shoulder 
                              gently)
                         Poor little Lisevata -- she still 
                         has her stage frights -- it will 
                         pass.

               Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he 
               attempts to soothe her.

               Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         It is not stage fright -- it's 
                         something more --

                                     PIMENOV
                              (tenderly)
                         What -- what is it? Last night...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Last night?... There was no applause.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (quickly)
                         There was -- there was.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         That theatre -- half empty -- dancing 
                         for those few -- I was frantic -- I 
                         finished -- the last beat and...
                              (she reclines her 
                              head as the swan 
                              finishing the dance)
                         ...I waited -- I listened -- but the 
                         applause didn't come -- nothing. A 
                         man in the box -- and just the claques 
                         behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We 
                         are dead -- it's finished.

               There is a sudden knocking at the door.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Meierheim --

               The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         What is this that you have cancelled 
                         your car? Who am I that I should 
                         wait like a fool at the door? And 
                         here on a whim, you cancel your car. 
                         Have you forgotten there is a 
                         performance? Do you know the time? 
                         Or, are we all mad? Am I your 
                         manager?... Have we a contract? Have 
                         we obligations? Am I blind?
                              (glances at his watch)
                         ...Or is that the time?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I'm cancelling the engagement.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Oh!

               Business of Pimenov signaling to him.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Oh! Madam is cancelling the 
                         engagement. Madam has chosen a funny 
                         time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, 
                         ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- 
                         there's a line in front of the theatre 
                         since six o'clock. The house is jammed 
                         to the roof.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The house is not full -- Is it really 
                         full?

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get 
                         dressed. And what an audience -- the 
                         French Ambassador -- American 
                         Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- 
                         er -- er --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (to Suzette)
                         Oh -- but it can't be.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
                              (she holds up her 
                              frock)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (changed mood)
                         All right, Suzette -- quickly -- 
                         hurry.

                                     PIMENOV
                         We will wait.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         You are late. Hurry.

               Meierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and 
               says:

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur 
                         to bring the car.

               Show few feet of Grusinskaya getting dressed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BY ELEVATOR

               Pimenov and Meierheim.

               Meierheim is pushing the bell.

                                     PIMENOV
                         How is the house?

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Terrible. After this, no more ballets 
                         for me. Jazz --
                              (snaps his fingers)
                         Just jazz.

                                     PIMENOV
                         If the house is empty again, I don't 
                         know --

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         When she gets her paint on and hears 
                         the music -- she'll be all right. I 
                         know these people.

               They are walking towards Kringelein's room. They are pacing 
               rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. They turn almost 
               together, but when they turn back past the CAMERA the CAMERA 
               PROCEEDS on into Kringelein's room. The CAMERA ENTERS THE 
               ROOM to a burst of laughter. Champagne bottles open, caviar, 
               smoke, etc.

               In the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen, 
               and a very fat waiter -- comedian.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You may laugh. Caviar and champagne 
                         may mean nothing to you, but to me -- 
                         they mean a great deal. You see, I'm 
                         ill and all of a sudden I got a fear 
                         of missing life. I don't want to 
                         miss life -- do you understand?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You are funny. You speak of life as 
                         if it were a train you wanted to 
                         catch.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- and for me, it's going to 
                         leave at any minute. Let's drink.

               The Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne. She shakes 
               her head.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm sure this beautiful room must 
                         appeal to your taste -- distinctive, 
                         don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 
                         'A-number one'. I'm in the textile 
                         trade and I know.
                              (he has a slight case 
                              of hiccups from the 
                              champagne. He touches 
                              the drapes)
                         And these are real silk drapes.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (amusedly)
                         Silk -- think of that -- silk -- 
                         they are, too.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (who hasn't stopped 
                              talking)
                         Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot 
                         and cold running water -- You see, I 
                         can get a bath whenever I like.

               At that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor 
               Clerk.

                                     PREYSING
                         The stenographer!

               Flaemmchen, hearing this, turns and looks off, apparently 
               through the door. Her manner changes, she puts down her glass.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Her master's voice!
                              (turns to Baron)
                         I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, don't go.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I'm engaged for the evening.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, can anyone engage you for the 
                         evening?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --
                              (to Baron)
                         Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five 
                         o'clock.
                              (she is moving out)

               Kringelein's optimism has left him for a moment, he stands 
               looking out of door undecided, he is drooped suddenly, as 
               though years had returned to him.

                                     BARON
                         What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to himself)
                         General Director Preysing!
                              (possibly he turns to 
                              Baron)
                         Baron, when I was sixteen years old, 
                         I started as an office boy in that 
                         man's factory --

                                     BARON
                         Then you know him?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Do I know him -- I know him through 
                         and through.

               They start to leave. Oh, gentlemen, please don't go.

                                     BARON
                         I must -- I hope to see you again, 
                         Mr. Kringelein.

               Baron leaves.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You will stay, Doctor -- if you have 
                         nothing better to do?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I have nothing better to do, Mr. 
                         Kringelein.

               They move into the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NO SCENES: 24 and 25 Sequence omitted from original script.

               NEAR ELEVATOR

               Pimenov and Meierheim are standing there.

               Meierheim is pushing the elevator button.

               The Baron stands near and pauses, he is now a changed man. 
               He looks off as he hears the voice of Grusinskaya, off in 
               the distance.

               Grusinskaya's Voice Hurry, Suzette.

               GRUSINSKAYA

               Shot from the Baron's angle. Grusinskaya is sweeping down 
               the corridor, followed by Suzette.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               BARON, PIMENOV AND MEIERHEIM

                                     BARON
                         Perhaps you could present me now, 
                         Mr. Pimenov.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not 
                         now -- here she is.

               Grusinskaya sweeps into scene.

               The Baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a 
               glance at her.

               They look at each other. He fixes his eyes on her 
               characteristically. She glances at him. This is the first 
               time they have met in the picture.

               She is impatient. As if to break an awkward silence, she 
               turns to Suzette.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         My coat.

               Suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls. As she takes 
               the coat off her arm, Grusinskaya glances down at the jewel 
               case.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Suzette -- I told you not to bring 
                         the pearls. I will not wear them 
                         tonight.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Why not?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Take them back, Suzette.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         You haven't time.

               Suzette hesitates.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Hurry, Suzette.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Such nonsense.

               Suzette toddles off with the pearls.

               The elevator opens, collects its passengers, all except the 
               Baron and descends.

               FLASH IN

               A shot of Grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up.

               FLASH IN

               A shot of the reverse of him looking down.

               The Baron pauses, hesitates, thinks. We are interested in 
               his action. For the first time he becomes furtive.

               HOTEL LOBBY - FROM ELEVATORS

               Music swells up from the Yellow Room. A great deal of noise, 
               confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit 
               Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other 
               people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the 
               great Grusinskaya.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                              (off scene)
                         The car for Madam Grusinskaya.

               The bellboy hears it and passes the word around. It seems to 
               be echoed through the lobby.

               People turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the 
               attention she is getting.

               THE CAMERA precedes her through the revolving door, as she 
               sweeps outside of the hotel.

               The Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go. 
               He looks furtively around and enters the hotel.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               UPPER CORRIDOR - CLOSEUP OF BARON

               As he watches Suzette returning from Grusinskaya's room. She 
               is about to push lift button - then decides to run downstairs.

               PREYSING'S ROOM

               Zinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door.

                                     PREYSING
                         No news from Manchester yet -- Do 
                         you think we ought to postpone the 
                         conference?

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Good heavens no. That'd create the 
                         very worst impression. You must be 
                         optimistic. You must convince them. 
                         You know as well as I do that the 
                         merger must go through.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes -- the merger must go through -- 
                         But I am used to making my deals on 
                         a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am 
                         an honest business man -- a good 
                         husband and father -- I have a sense 
                         of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. 
                         I couldn't live happily otherwise.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Well, don't get excited about it. We 
                         agreed that the merger with the 
                         Saxonia people must go through.

                                     PREYSING
                         I want to dictate my statement for 
                         tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. 
                         I like to have things down before me 
                         in black and white.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         I'll see you in the morning then, at 
                         the conference. Everything'll be all 
                         right, Preysing... Don't worry. 
                         Goodnight.

                                     PREYSING
                         Good night.

               Zinnowitz leaves.

                                      SEQUENCE "#2"

               FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM

               We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the 
               typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that 
               Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind 
               his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an 
               odd effect. We don't know quite what it is.

                                     PREYSING'S VOICE
                         Both parties have fully agreed that 
                         this merger can result only in mutual 
                         advantages.

               Preysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's 
               room.

               The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse.

               Flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing. Preying strides 
               forward As he strides he says:

                                     PREYSING
                         Moreover --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (repeating)
                         Moreover --

               Preysing paces the room.

                                     PREYSING
                              (repeating)
                         Moreover --
                              (he pauses, thinking. 
                              Picks up telephone 
                              quickly -- into 
                              telephone)
                         Is there a telegram for me yet?... 
                         Oh -- when it does, send it up.

               During this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her 
               fingers that have been over-worked. She glances at her wrist-
               watch.

               Preysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen.

                                     PREYSING
                         Now, where was I?
                              (he looks over the 
                              sheet in her 
                              typewriter -- 
                              accidentally his arm 
                              touches her neck)
                         Oh -- sorry.
                              (he puts his cigar in 
                              his mouth and walks 
                              away. As he walks 
                              away)
                         Where was I?

               As he turns, he catches a down shot on her from behind as 
               she stretches back showing her busts. Seeing his face looking 
               down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at 
               attention.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Moreover...

                                     PREYSING
                         Moreover...

               It seems a silly kind of lull.

                                     PREYSING
                         Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' 
                         office?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         No -- only occasional jobs.
                              (she yawns suddenly)

                                     PREYSING
                         Tired?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You pay me.

                                     PREYSING
                         You're a very unusual stenographer --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Moreover...

                                     PREYSING
                         Moreover...
                              (as he paces the room, 
                              it is obvious that 
                              he is trying to 
                              collect his thoughts)

               She looks at him, waits a moment and then begins 
               characteristically to, change the sheet of paper.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I don't see why it's unusual for a 
                         stenographer to be pretty -- if she 
                         does her work well, -- seems so silly. 
                         I don't know why they don't like 
                         girls like me in offices. Personally, 
                         I hate offices -- I'd much rather be 
                         in the movies.

                                     PREYSING
                         Movies?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes, I photograph very well. Look --

               She tosses magazine -- as if it were nothing at all over to 
               him.

               He looks down at it without touching it.

                                     PREYSING
                         What is this?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I got ten marks for that.

               He picks it up.

                                     PREYSING
                         You...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (without looking up)
                         Me.

               As he looks at picture -- he lowers his voice two notes.

                                     PREYSING
                         You...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (reading)
                         Moreover...

                                     PREYSING
                              (quickly)
                         What?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (reading)
                         Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.

                                     PREYSING
                         What brown hands you have.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         That's from skiing.

                                     PREYSING
                         Skiing?
                              (he holds her hands)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (natural -- unabashed)
                         Yes... A man I know took me to 
                         Switzerland last month...

               He drops her hand suddenly.

                                     PREYSING
                         A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That 
                         must have been nice -- for him.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (reading)
                         Only in mutual advantages -- 
                         moreover...

               Preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to 
               the work in hand.

                                     PREYSING
                         Moreover... He was a lucky man -- 
                         that man.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Perhaps.
                              (she waits at attention)

               He paces back and forth again.

                                     PREYSING
                         Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married 
                         man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?
                              (she takes cigarette)
                         I went to Florence once, too.

                                     PREYSING
                         With the same friend?

               By this time she is smoking her cigarette.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (without looking at 
                              him)
                         No.

                                     PREYSING
                              (quickly)
                         Moreover, the possibility of the 
                         successful termination of negotiations 
                         now pending with the Manchester Cotton 
                         Company...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Not too quickly.

                                     PREYSING
                         What?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're a little too fast.

                                     PREYSING
                         Can't you understand me?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I understand you perfectly.

                                     PREYSING
                         Have you got it now?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (typing)
                         Cotton Company --

                                     PREYSING
                         Should throw a great weight into the 
                         balance...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (as he turns his back 
                              looks at him 
                              significantly)
                         ...weight into the balance...

               There is a sudden knock at the door.

                                     PREYSING
                         Come in.

               Boy enters with telegram.

                                     BOY
                         Telegram for Mr. Preysing.

               With almost hysterical speed, Preysing snatches the telegram -- 
               opens it. Flaemmchen powders her nose.

               IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING

               it is bad news. He wipes the perspiration from his forehead.

                                     PREYSING
                         Oh -- oh.
                              (he throws the telegram 
                              away from him, onto 
                              her desk. Paces the 
                              room.)

               Flaemmchen, believing the telegram to be something that she 
               must copy, picks it up quite naturally and reads it.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Deal with Manchester Cotton Company 
                         definitely off.

               Preysing turns and snatches the telegram from her.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Sorry.

               Preysing paces the room with the telegram.

               Flaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at

                         How nice -- your daughters?

                              to himself)

                         Is that Mrs. Preysing.

                         Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
                              (she is looking at

                              definitely)
                         That'll be all -- be here tomorrow 
                         at nine o'clock.
                              (he turns, goes out 
                              onto balcony with 
                              telegram)

               Flaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up 
               her papers and is prepared to leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Trim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room. Take her down to 
               elevator.

               At the same time, CAMERA PANS OVER and shows the Baron's 
               chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door.

                              (calling)
                         Come in!

               Trim the chauffeur into the Baron's room.

               BARON'S ROOM

               Baron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he 
               closes the door behind him and stands there with an 
               inquisitive look.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You are late -- the dancer's gone to 
                         the theatre.

                                     BARON
                              (very nonchalantly)
                         Well?

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         She's gone to the theatre -- don't 
                         you know?

                                     BARON
                              (very nonchalantly)
                         Yes.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (ready to explode)
                         And what are you going to do?

                                     BARON
                         The pearls are in her room.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (threateningly)
                         Now listen to me. The others are 
                         getting suspicious of you. I was on 
                         the telephone to Amsterdam today, 
                         they think you're scared.

                                     BARON
                         I've been careful, I've been waiting 
                         my chance.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You've been waiting your chance. 
                         You're too much of a gentleman -- 
                         that's the trouble with you.

                                     BARON
                         I told you I'll get the pearls 
                         tonight.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Need any help?

                                     BARON
                         No.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Have you got that skeleton key?

               He takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it 
               to the Baron.

                                     BARON
                         No --

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Why?

                                     BARON
                         The floor clerk is out there in the 
                         corridor -- she sees everything ---

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (contemptuously)
                         I could take care of her.

                                     BARON
                         How?

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Chloroform on a handkerchief from 
                         behind -- while you...

                                     BARON
                         No -- no -- no -- no...

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Why?

                                     BARON
                         Poor girl -- chloroform would give 
                         her a rotten headache... I know -- I 
                         had it in the war. Besides, she's 
                         very pretty -- not young but --

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You're no good for this business. 
                         It's just a joke to you...

                                     BARON
                              (swings suddenly on 
                              him)
                         I don't like your tone.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (comes up to him -- 
                              face to face)
                         No --

               Baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists 
               his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly.

                                     BARON
                         Get out and leave it to me... be 
                         ready to leave on the night train 
                         for Amsterdam...

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         With the pearls?

                                     BARON
                         With the pearls --

               The Chauffeur leaves.

               The moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad 
               lib.

               Crosses to window.

               FACADE OF HOTEL

               The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear. He 
               proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room. Preysing is 
               apparently in the bathroom. Baron skips nimbly past the room.

               Working at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room.

               GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

               Baron is pretty shaken by jump.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               Darkness -- light from transom and building opposite.

               Business of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing 
               coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud 
               speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows:

                                     LOUD SPEAKER
                         'You are listening to the music of 
                         the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous 
                         Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.'

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               Baron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls 
               in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE ONTO PREYSING'S BALCONY:

               Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud 
               speaker seen. Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene 
               bullying waiter.

               GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

               The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's 
               balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm.

               Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is 
               locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers 
               refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd 
               way.

               As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off 
               of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the 
               operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's 
               room.

               He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger 
               prints off with his handkerchief.

               He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring 
               suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want 
               to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. 
               Crosses to the door again.

               Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's 
               voice singing an absurd song.

               He listens. She is coming in.

               The key turns in the door.

               Quickly he hides behind the curtains.

               Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, 
               enters the room.

               He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. 
               After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. 
               We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door.

               The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear 
               from Preysing's radio.

               The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer 
               it but continues her duties.

               At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it 
               up and speaks.

                                     CHAMBERMAID
                         No -- no -- there is no one here.
                              (she replaces the 
                              receiver)

               At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears 
               at the open door.

                                     INSPECTRESS
                              (to Chambermaid)
                         You're late... What have you been 
                         doing?

                                     CHAMBERMAID
                              (grumbling)
                         Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come 
                         back - come back.' They won't get 
                         out of their rooms.

               The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around 
               the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron. She is looking 
               at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking 
               for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see if it 
               is locked.

               Telephone bell rings again.

               Inspectress picks it up quickly.

                                     INSPECTRESS
                         No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here... 
                         The Western Theater?... No...

               Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette.

               Suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage.

                                     SUZETTE'S VOICE
                         Have you seen Madame?

                                     CLERK'S VOICE
                              (replying)
                         Isn't she at the theatre?

               Suzette comes in and hurries to telephone.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes... 
                         Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?... 
                         No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at 
                         the hotel.

               INTERCUT

               With the Baron watching.

               GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

               During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid 
               out of the room. Business ad lib.

               Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the 
               telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                              (into telephone)
                         Pimenov?... What's happening?... No, 
                         I haven't found her. Is Desprez 
                         dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all 
                         right. Keep the show going.
                              (bangs down receiver)
                         Wait till I see her, she'll pay for 
                         this -- this little trick is going 
                         to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach 
                         of contract.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madame is ill -- her nerves...

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Her nerves... What about my nerves?... 
                         Who is she anyway? Where does she 
                         think she is -- Russia? Those days 
                         have passed.

               He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is 
               in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one 
               shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into 
               the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, 
               make-up is on her face -- she is breathless.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madame --

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Well?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I want to be alone.

               The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to 
               pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Where have you been?

                                     SUZETTE
                         Should I -- Does madame wish...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Suzette, please go, I want to be 
                         alone.

               Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, 
               waiting for Meierheim.

               Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         I suppose I can cancel the Vienna 
                         engagement.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I wish to be alone.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         You'll be very much alone, my dear 
                         madame. This is the end.
                              (he stamps out)

               Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it 
               on Meierheim's exit.

               DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON.

               It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to 
               door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and 
               throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses 
               slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the 
               strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz.

               Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob.

               FLASH OF BARON

               Watching her.

               GRUSINSKAYA

               Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. 
               Then she becomes weary again.

               With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the 
               curtain -- where the Baron is standing.

               BARON

               We see him tense himself.

               GRUSINSKAYA

               She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out 
               of scene.

               CLOSEUP OF BARON

               He peeps around the curtains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA

               She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks 
               steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her 
               hands and we hear her say:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The end -- over -- finished --

               Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom.

               Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across 
               the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and 
               darts quickly into the half open door of the closet.

               She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, 
               places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are 
               quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- 
               asks for the theatre.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The Western Theatre --

               She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- 
               stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to 
               telephone speaks:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Western Theatre?

               She glances up at the clock.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet 
                         master... Grusinskaya -- hurry -- 
                         hurry.

               Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she 
               commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. 
               Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.

               She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into 
               the telephone --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. 
                         I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... 
                         No, no don't --
                              (long pause)
                         ...Just alone... Good night, good 
                         night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, 
                         how is it going, badly?... Uh?... 
                         Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- 
                         and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- 
                         they didn't miss me?... They didn't 
                         miss me.
                              (she lets her hand 
                              drop with the receiver 
                              and goes on talking 
                              into the air)
                         They didn't miss me -- good night, 
                         Pimenov...

               She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in 
               her hand, unreplaced.

               The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind 
               her the Baron peers from the closet.

               Her head sinks down upon her hands.

               A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts 
               the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice 
               of Opehlia, she speaks:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (with great humility)
                         Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have 
                         finished.
                              (she replaces the 
                              receiver)

               The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It 
               is in fact, ballet.

               Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. 
               She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the 
               table, or hangs it over the telephone.

               She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the 
               Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.

               We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. 
               "No, there is not time." She is returning calmly. She crosses 
               to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. 
               She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. 
               She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.

               She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded 
               hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.

               The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he 
               looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for 
               the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his 
               eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.

               It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.

               At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his 
               hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her 
               bed.

               She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer 
               who has heard something, then reassured. She places the 
               veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is 
               quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her 
               head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal 
               and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away 
               upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance 
               herself.

               The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to 
               the bedside noiselessly and stands there.

               She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the 
               glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.

               She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the 
               floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal 
               falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a 
               sitting position.

                                     BARON
                         Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.

               She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be 
               coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the 
               bed.

                                     BARON
                         Careful -- there's broken glass on 
                         the floor.

               Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her 
               kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse 
               of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she 
               is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be 
               a silly movement.

                                     BARON
                         There.
                              (takes a pillow from 
                              the bed throws it 
                              upon the floor over 
                              the glass, steps 
                              back)

               She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which 
               was lying across the back of a chair.

               Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She 
               draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron 
               puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, "What is this?" She glances 
               back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this 
               man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense 
               of relief with her. She is trembling.

               The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his 
               danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand 
               marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she 
               will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He 
               could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or 
               silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating 
               sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)

                                     BARON
                         Please do not be frightened, Madam.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (after a silence)
                         What do you want here?

                                     BARON
                         Nothing -- only to be here.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why do you hide in my room?

                                     BARON
                         But surely you must know -- because 
                         I love you.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Because you love me -- you love me?

               She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she 
               throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more 
               passionately.

                                     BARON
                              (going over to her)
                         Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do 
                         you good to cry? Are you afraid? 
                         Shall I go?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I was so alone -- always alone -- 
                         and suddenly you were there and said 
                         that.
                              (sitting up)
                         No. I am not afraid. It is strange.

                                     BARON
                         Don't cry -- it tears my heart to 
                         see you sob like that.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (regaining control)
                         Nerves -- just nerves. You must 
                         forgive me. I have had a bad evening. 
                         I am very tired. Do you know what it 
                         is to be tired -- tired of a routine 
                         existence?

                                     BARON
                         I'm afraid not -- I usually do just 
                         what I feel like doing at the moment.

               A look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the 
               situation. She rises with returning dignity and pulls her 
               robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial 
               Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for. She 
               sweeps across the room.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         So you feel like coming into a lady's 
                         room -- and you come... What now?

                                     BARON
                              (following her)
                         I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Certainly.

               She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds 
               it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches 
               him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale 
               the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. 
               She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks 
               into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to 
               live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why do you look at me like that?

                                     BARON
                         I did not know you were so 
                         beautiful... and --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (bitterly)
                         And then --?

                                     BARON
                         No irony. You're so appealing -- so 
                         soft -- so tired. I feel like taking 
                         you in my arms and not letting 
                         anything more happen to you -- ever.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (involuntarily closing 
                              her eyes)
                         And -- and --

                                     BARON
                         How tired you are!

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes -- tired...

                                     BARON
                         So alone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Alone. All alone.
                              (whispers in Russian)
                         Oh, you strange -- strange creature.

                                     BARON
                         You mustn't talk Russian to me.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Strange man...

                                     BARON
                         Am I quite strange to you?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Not quite strange now. It is as if I 
                         had been expecting you. You know, 
                         once when the Grand Duke was alive, 
                         I found a man hiding in my room -- a 
                         young officer --

                                     BARON
                         And...?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         He disappeared. Later he was found 
                         dead.

                                     BARON
                         I never knew it was so dangerous to 
                         hide in a woman's room when she's 
                         alone.
                              (he embraces her)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Go away. Who are you --?

                                     BARON
                         A man who could love -- that is all, 
                         who has forgotten everything else 
                         for you.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You could love me. It is so long 
                         since I have heard that word. Nobody 
                         has loved me for a long time. It is 
                         so icy-cold to be famous. One is so 
                         cruelly alone. How is it that you -- 
                         Let me look at you. Your hands. Your 
                         eyes. Why could you love me?

                                     BARON
                         I saw you just now -- then I saw you 
                         cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- 
                         Grusinskaya...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew 
                         how I slaved and slaved for 
                         Grusinskaya -- for the success of 
                         Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of 
                         Grusinskaya... and what is she now? 
                         Just someone who has found that on 
                         the day success ceases life ceases -- 
                         Are you listening to me -- Do you 
                         understand? -- I want you to 
                         understand.

                                     BARON
                         Yes -- I do understand.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I think you must go now -- the key 
                         is on the floor.

                                     BARON
                         I'm not going -- You know I'm not 
                         going -- Let me stay here?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I want to be alone.

                                     BARON
                         That is not so -- you don't want to 
                         be alone.
                              (he looks back at the 
                              bed as if remembering 
                              the suicide.)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I want to be alone --

                                     BARON
                         No -- You don't want to be alone at 
                         all -- You were in despair before -- 
                         If I left you, you'd feel worse than 
                         you did before, You must not be alone -- 
                         You mustn't cry -- you must forget... 
                         Tell me that I can stay with you -- 
                         tell me.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (whispering)
                         Just for a minute then.

               Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard --

                                     BARON
                         What? Say it again -- I didn't hear.

               She whispers.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You -- man...

               The way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She 
               has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting 
               and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly.

               (NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is)

               She reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on. 
               She can't find the other.

               Business as he gets other slipper for her.

               He kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Thank you -- you are gallant.
                              (she turns, her mood 
                              has changed)
                         What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya 
                         weeping is a sight worth seeing. It 
                         is many years since she did such a 
                         thing... You frightened me -- badly. 
                         You're responsible for this -- painful 
                         scene.

               He watches her.

               The sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating 
               warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, 
               volubly.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The stage frays one's nerves... the 
                         discipline -- it's so exacting. 
                         Discipline means doing what you don't 
                         want to do and take no pleasure in 
                         doing. Do you know what I mean? Have 
                         you ever experienced the weariness 
                         that comes from discipline?

                                     BARON
                         I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take 
                         pleasure in doing.

               Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I see -- you do only what you take 
                         pleasure in doing. You take pleasure 
                         in coming into a woman's bedroom and 
                         you come. You take pleasure in a 
                         dangerous climb onto a balcony, so 
                         you do it... And what is your pleasure 
                         now?

                                     BARON
                              (naive as he says 
                              frankly)
                         I should like to smoke.

               She rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes 
               her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing 
               table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds 
               out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches 
               him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale 
               the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. 
               She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks 
               into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to 
               live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why do you smile?

                                     BARON
                         Because I can see something in the 
                         mirror that you cannot. My dear --
                              (he pauses suddenly)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         What can you see?

                                     BARON
                         You are beautiful!

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         No.

                                     BARON
                         Beautiful but so sad. I did not know 
                         it was so dangerous to look into a 
                         woman's bedroom.

               Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses 
               it. A long tender and sincere embrace.

               Her eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his 
               whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages 
               herself.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I think you had better go now. The 
                         key is on the floor.

               He glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command.

                                     BARON
                         I'm not going... You know that I'm 
                         not going... Do you think I could 
                         leave you alone here? After that --?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         What?

                                     BARON
                         The veronal -- you. I'm going to 
                         stay here with you.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I want to be alone.

                                     BARON
                         That is not the truth.
                              (he catches her wrists)
                         You do not want to be alone -- you're 
                         afraid of being alone -- I know you're 
                         afraid. I know you. You were 
                         desperate, just now, if I go away 
                         you'll be more desperate than ever. 
                         Say I am to stay with you... say it.
                              (he almost shakes her)

               Her head falls slowly on his breast.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (whispers)
                         For just a minute then.
                              (she pulls away, 
                              crosses the room, 
                              quickly to the door, 
                              with almost a cry. 
                              She looks around for 
                              the key to the door)
                         No -- oh, no!

               He crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms.

                                     BARON
                         Just for a minute, Grusinskaya --

               Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor.

               FRONT ON SHOT OF KRINGELEIN

               approaching the CAMERA with the Doctor.

               They are returning from the bar and are passing Grusinskaya's 
               room. THE CAMERA precedes them. The Doctor is 
               characteristically drunk. He is silent, tense, cynical. A 
               distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for 
               the first time by alcohol.

               Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon 
               his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole.

               THE CAMERA backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because 
               the Doctor has paused at the door.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. 
                         To live -- to live -- in the Grand 
                         Hotel.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (with a deprecating 
                              gesture)
                         The Grand Hotel.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the 
                         champagne -- girls when they dance -- 
                         all the shining ice in those big 
                         silver things -- That's life --

                                     DOCTOR
                         Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are 
                         drunk -- good night.
                              (he leaves)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to doctor)
                         But Doctor --

               But the Doctor has gone.

               Kringelein re-enters his beautiful room. He crosses to the 
               mirror, regards himself. Business ad lib.

               He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat. 
               Imitating the doctor, he repeats:

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Mr. Kringelein -- you are drunk -- 
                         good night.

               He puts his hat on the knob of the bed.

               He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the 
               carnation out of his buttonhole. With the coat over his arm 
               and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass 
               and some water which he sees standing on the night table by 
               his bed.

               He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with 
               water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine 
               bottles.

               His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain.

               He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time -- 
               his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain.

               He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops 
               into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden 
               impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine 
               away.

               With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song 
               that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid 
               song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song. He saunters 
               around the room, undressing.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO PASSAGE

               His voice is still heard in the passage.

               Rows of shoes outside the doors. The dozing night clerk hears 
               the voice and looks up, startled.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO A WATCHMAN

               with his clock, hears the voice.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO A CORNER OF DOCTOR'S ROOM

               He is dozing in a chair with his clothes on. He looks up 
               suddenly, hearing the voice.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO PREYSING'S ROOM

               He is snoring. The distant voice disturbs him. He turns in 
               his sleep.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               A beautiful picture -- the distant voices -- shadows.

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                         I've never been as happy.

                                     GRU'S VOICE
                         What did you say?

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                         I've never been as happy!

                                     GRUSINSKAYA'S VOICE
                         Say it again -- say it!

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                         I have never been so happy!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

               He is now dressed in an absurd night dress. He crosses to 
               the bed, still singing, climbs into the huge bed -- the great 
               pillows. His hand goes out -- he pulls out the light. He 
               might be an Emperor as he turns with a happy, tired sigh.

               DISTANT CLOCK CHIMES.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                   END OF SEQUENCE "#2"

                                      SEQUENCE "#3"

               FADE IN:

               TELEPHONE ROOM

               It is the first time we have seen it. There are about eight 
               girls very busy. Morning confusion. (parts to be written)

               We pick up essential lines as we PAN DOWN SHOOTING AT THE 
               GIRL'S FACES, assuming the CAMERA to be the board.

                                     GIRL ONE
                         Grand Hotel -- good morning -- no, 
                         Baron von Gaigern's room does not 
                         answer... Yes,... all right... Baron 
                         von Gaigern's chauffeur calling.

               CAMERA PANS TO:

                                     GIRL THREE
                         Good morning, nine-thirty Doctor 
                         Otternschlag... No, Doctor, no 
                         messages... No, Doctor.

               CAMERA PANS TO:

                                     GIRL FIVE
                         Grand Hotel -- good morning... who 
                         is calling Madam Grusinskaya?... Oh, 
                         Mr. Pimenov. Madam Grusinskaya is 
                         not to be disturbed, sir... no, sir... 
                         yes, sir --

               The word passes down repeated.

                                     VOICE
                         Mr. Preysing's calls to one sixty 
                         two for today.

               CAMERA PANS TO:

                                     GIRL EIGHT
                         -- good morning... Mr. Preysing --
                              (she plugs through)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CONFERENCE ROOM

               Telephone bell ringing.

               General shot.

               Gerstenkorn, an old business man and Doctor Waitz, counsel 
               for the Saxonia organization are sitting at a gree table, 
               smoking and waiting.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (glances at watch)
                         Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us 
                         waiting.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                              (who has returned)
                         He likes to play the great man.

                                     WAITZ
                              (glancing at market 
                              report from table)
                         The Preysing stock is holding its 
                         own today on the market.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                         Ask Preysing what it's costing him 
                         to keep it up.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         And ask me what it's costing us to 
                         hammer it down.

                                     WAITZ
                         Exactly.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         If the Preysing people get the 
                         Manchester contract, we shall 
                         certainly merge with the Preysing 
                         company -- but if they haven't they're 
                         ruined -- Preysing will have to 
                         declare himself.

                                     WAITZ
                         Shhh -- here he is now.

               The door opens and Flaemmchen enters. She is agreeably 
               surprised to see the room full of men. She likes men.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (beams)
                         Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr. 
                         Preysing will be here in a minute.

               Business of Schweimann and Flaemmchen.

               Gerstenkorn, making notes, glances at his watch again.

               Door opens suddenly.

                                     PREYSING
                              (enters)
                         Good morning, gentlemen.

                                     MEN
                         Good morning.

                                     PREYSING
                         Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting 
                         for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal 
                         advisor.

                                     WAITZ
                         Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against 
                         us? -- The whole thing seems to me 
                         to be very simple.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Very simple -- I've always liked the 
                         way you dressed, Preysing -- English, 
                         isn't it?

                                     PREYSING
                              (disturbed)
                         What?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (quickly)
                         They turn out marvelous material in 
                         Manchester.

                                     PREYSING
                         Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they 
                         do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we 
                         begin at the beginning? -- Have we 
                         cigars -- water and everything?

               Flaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little table for 
               work is seen in several CLOSEUPS:

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                              (with a wink to 
                              Gerstenkorn)
                         Manchester is a very interesting 
                         city, don't you think so, Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                              (stalling)
                         Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in 
                         the textile industry naturally has 
                         to know Manchester.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         There's a lot of business to be done 
                         with the Manchester Cotton Company. 
                         They've the whole English market 
                         right in their hands. Have you any 
                         connections with -- Manchester?

                                     PREYSING
                              (quickly)
                         We have a good many connections in 
                         England, naturally.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         I mean with the Manchester people?

                                     PREYSING
                              (looking at Gerstenkorn 
                              impudently)
                         We are here to discuss our merger. 
                         Naturally I can make no statement at 
                         this time. We must begin at the 
                         beginning.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (winking at Schweimann)
                         All right.

                              (far-away commencing 
                              to read his report)
                         Since, on the eleventh of June, this 
                         year -- when the first negotiations 
                         for a merger between our respective 
                         firms was entered into -- both parties 
                         have fully agreed that this merger 
                         can result only in mutual advantages.

               INTERCUT this speech, which if played by Beery will be 
               interesting, with signals, winks and signs between the other 
               three men.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!

                                     PREYSING
                         I'm laying before you the last general 
                         statement of our concern. Active 
                         capital, plant and machinery, raw 
                         material and finished product -- for 
                         instance -- mop rags --

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Mop rags --!

               Business between Preysing and Flaemmchen finding papers on 
               'Mop Rag' report.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         What we want to know about is 
                         Manchester.

                                     WAITZ
                         Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we 
                         want to know.

                                     PREYSING
                         I'd like to wait for Justice 
                         Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --

                                     PREYSING
                         No water -- What a place!

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         All you have to do is phone for it.

               Flaemmchen, who is on her toes and busy every minute, rushes 
               to the telephone and gives an order -- her conversation is 
               heard over the conversation of the men in the room -- CAMERA 
               HOLDS ON FLAEMMCHEN:

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Water -- seltzer, three or four 
                         bottles and cigars -- good ones.

                                     WAITZ
                         I can see this session is going to 
                         be exhaustive.

                                     PREYSING
                         Now to proceed with the projected 
                         merger, the advantages for the Saxonia 
                         are so obvious...

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Oh -- now let's talk like adults. 
                         You want to tell us now a along story 
                         of what your factory can do. We know 
                         all that you could tell us and if 
                         you tell the truth it wouldn't sound 
                         so good. When you first approached 
                         us...

                                     PREYSING
                         We did not approach you.

                                     WAITZ
                              (quickly looking 
                              through the papers)
                         Letter on file September fourteenth 
                         would show that you approached...

                                     PREYSING
                              (snatching the document 
                              from his hand -- 
                              losing his temper)
                         It isn't so -- this was a response 
                         to a tentative feeler of your own.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (snatching the document 
                              violently away)
                         Tentative my foot -- a month before 
                         this your old father-in-law came 
                         very privately and scratched at my 
                         door.

                                     PREYSING
                         Scratched --
                              (he nearly chokes)
                         We did not take the initiative.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Of course you took the initiative.

               Zinnowitz enters the room.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the 
                         conference is already underway.

                                     PREYSING
                         Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- 
                         I'm at cross-purposes with these 
                         gentlemen -- will you clear up the 
                         situation?

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         But the situation is perfectly clear, 
                         If you will allow me --
                              (he clears his throat)

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         How clear is Manchester?

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, 
                         I'm told.
                              (to Preysing)
                         Have you said anything about 
                         Manchester, Mr. Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                         I can make no statement about 
                         Manchester at this time.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Well -- gentlemen.

               There is dead silence for a moment -- he clears his throat, 
               commences in almost the same tone as Preysing.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Since, on the eleventh of June of 
                         this year -- when the first 
                         negotiations for a merger...

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (over Zinnowitz's 
                              voice -- with a sigh -- 
                              sits back)
                         Thank God we're beginning at the 
                         beginning.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                              (stops suddenly -- 
                              takes glasses from 
                              his nose -- he is 
                              speaking, not reading)
                         As you remember it -- when you 
                         approached us...

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (bangs the paper down)
                         We did not approach you.

                                     PREYSING
                         I know you did -- I said you did --

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         And I said we didn't.

                                     WAITZ
                         And I know we didn't.

               During all this commotion Flaemmchen is paying no attention 
               whatsoever. She is calmly spraying herself with a perfume 
               atomizer and smiling at a gentleman. The noise continues 
               over her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NO SCENE 61

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines. Grusinskaya is 
               reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe drawn 
               about her. She speaks voluably.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition 
                         was in my blood -- no rest, no 
                         stopping. We were drilled like little 
                         soldiers -- We danced in the school 
                         of the Imperial Ballet, in St. 
                         Petersburg. I was little and slim 
                         but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- 
                         No rest, no stopping. And then -- I 
                         became famous and whoever is famous 
                         is alone... But why should I be 
                         telling you this? Last night I did 
                         not know you at all -- who are you, 
                         really? -- I do not even know your 
                         name.

                                     BARON
                         I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My 
                         mother called me Flix.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Flix. -- And how do you live? What 
                         kind of a person are you?

                                     BARON
                         I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep 
                         of a white flock -- I shall die on 
                         the gallows.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Really?

                                     BARON
                         Really, I haven't a bit of character. 
                         None at all.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         No?

                                     BARON
                         When I was a little boy I was taught 
                         to ride and be a gentleman -- at 
                         school, it was a monastery, I learned 
                         to pray and lie -- and ---

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         And?

                                     BARON
                         And then, in the war, to kill and 
                         hide. That's all.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         And what do you do -- now?

                                     BARON
                         I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large 
                         like a happy pig, devouring anything 
                         of life that pleases me, I really 
                         belong in jail

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Oh! What a picture -- and what else?

                                     BARON
                              (seriously)
                         I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
                              (he turns away)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         That's a silly joke.

                                     BARON
                              (turns -- takes both 
                              her hands)
                         Please look at me. You must believe 
                         me -- you must believe that I love 
                         you -- that I have never known what 
                         love is -- until last night.
                              (he releases her hands 
                              and turns away again.)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         What is the matter?

               He does not answer.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Flix!

               The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them 
               before her.

                                     BARON
                         There.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (with a little cry of 
                              pain)
                         Oh --
                              (in the silence 
                              Grusinskaya puts her 
                              head in her hands 
                              and thinks)

               The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then 
               holds back.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (softly)
                         Did you come here just -- just for 
                         that? Oh -- it's horrible.

               Pause.

               She is suddenly cold.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You may keep the pearls -- I don't 
                         want them any more -- I'll make you 
                         a present of them.

                                     BARON
                              (passionately)
                         I don't want them now.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (broken)
                         I'll not denounce you.

                                     BARON
                         I know.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         So --

                                     BARON
                         Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         But now, you must go... I give you 
                         the pearls. But now you must go ---

                                     BARON
                         I wanted money desperately -- Can 
                         you understand? -- That's why I wanted 
                         the pearls. I was threatened -- I 
                         was desperately in need of a certain 
                         big sum of money. I've been following 
                         you -- I've admired you. But I have 
                         forced myself not to think about you -- 
                         Last night, at last, I managed to 
                         came into your room and -- and now.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (softly)
                         And now?

                                     BARON
                         I couldn't go through with it.
                              (his head goes down 
                              into her lap -- he 
                              sighs:)
                         Remarkable.

               His hand touches her hair -- tenderly.

                                     BARON
                         Do you understand?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes -- yes -- yes.

               There is a sudden knock at the door.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Quickly -- here.

               With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the 
               bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens the 
               door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Good morning, Suzette.

                                     SUZETTE
                              (delighted to see her 
                              in a good mood)
                         Good morning, Madam.

               She puts the coffee down on the table.

               Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee 
               down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily 
               crested cigarette case of the Baron.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam has slept well?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Oh, yes, Suzette.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam will dress now, it is late.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Five minutes, Suzette, come back in 
                         five minutes. I'll ring.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Yes, madam Suzette knows all about 
                         it.

               She is a French woman. She is pleased.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam is beautiful this morning.

               As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes, Suzette.

               Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings 
               open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You must go now.

               As she speaks the telephone goes. She gives the telephone a 
               dirty look. Telephone rings again. She pulls him across to 
               the telephone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         There -- it begins.

               With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and 
               speaks.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...

               During this scene the Baron is touching her shoulder. A 
               charming light moment. She continues to speak into telephone. 
               His touch probably tickles her, she laughs -- quickly covers 
               the receiver so that Meierheim will not hear her laugh.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (to Baron)
                         No --

               During this scene she is listening to Meierheim. She frowns 
               suddenly --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you 
                         mad? We always have great success in 
                         Vienna... Certainly not. Come here 
                         and see me... yes... good-bye.

               She turns to the Baron and their arms go around each other.

               The telephone rings again.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (quickly)
                         There -- the day begins... I must go 
                         to rehearsal.

               She lets the telephone ring.

                                     BARON
                         Grusinskaya --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes.

                                     BARON
                         You do believe that I really love 
                         you?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd 
                         die after last night.

                                     BARON
                         I want to be good to you -- madly 
                         good.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Suzette will be back here in a minute.

                                     BARON
                         I'll go -- good-bye.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Shall I see you again?

                                     BARON
                         I --

               Telephone bell rings again.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Suzette will be back here any minute.

                                     BARON
                         When are you leaving Berlin?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Very early in the morning.

                                     BARON
                         For Vienna?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you 
                         come too -- I think it would be better -- 
                         for us -- for us both.

                                     BARON
                         Oh -- yes but -- later.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why later?

                                     BARON
                         I have no money now -- I must get 
                         some first -- I must get some.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I'll give you what you need -- I 
                         have money.

                                     BARON
                         Oh no -- that would spoil everything. 
                         I'll -- I will manage somehow -- 
                         I'll manage myself. I will go with 
                         you. When does the train leave?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Six twenty-seven in the morning... 
                         But the money?

                                     BARON
                         Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a 
                         whole day. I'll be on that train.

               They move towards the door.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I shall dance and you'll be with me 
                         and then -- listen -- After that you 
                         will come with me to Lake Como, I 
                         have a villa there. The sun will be 
                         shining. I will take a vacation -- 
                         six weeks -- eight weeks. We'll be 
                         happy and lazy. And then you will go 
                         with me to South America -- oh!

               Telephone starts ringing.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You must go now. Be careful on your 
                         way to your room.

                                     BARON
                         I'll go. -- I love you.
                              (he kisses her)
                         I'll be on that train. I'll get the 
                         money.

               She holds him back. The telephone is ringing.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Don't do anything foolish -- I'm 
                         alarmed about you.

                                     BARON
                         Don't worry. I'll be on the train.
                              (he kisses her)
                         He leaves.

               Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya breathes 
               deeply, stretches herself. She goes to the glass and looks 
               at herself -- smiling. Happily she takes the pearls, kisses 
               them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the telephone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (speaking into 
                              telephone)
                         Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are 
                         you, in your room? Come, I will see 
                         you now... hurry.

               She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is humming a 
               tune. She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair happily, 
               she is indeed younger.

               Suzette is putting out a dark dress.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Not that dark dress -- something 
                         light -- bright -- it's a sunny 
                         morning, Suzette.

               Suzette happily glances at her.

               There is a knock at the door.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Come in.
                              (sings)

               Pimenov enters, before he can speak --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Good morning, Pimenov.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (a little puzzled at 
                              change in her)
                         Good morning, Gru -- your --

               Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new 
                         ballet -- it must have mad music -- 
                         I'll explain it to you later. But 
                         now, hurry to the theatre -- I want 
                         full rehearsal -- properties -- full 
                         ballet and some musicians. Hurry -- 
                         Quickly. I will be there --

               During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is 
               busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face.

               Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him 
               the cigarette case on the table.

               As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost 
               sweeps Suzette to the door with him.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Gru -- you are positively radiant.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes, Pimenov.
                              (quickly to Suzette)
                         One minute, Suzette, I will call 
                         you.

               They leave.

               Grusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the 
               telephone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (very very softly - 
                              her voice is like 
                              music to operator)
                         Hello -- will you -- will you get me 
                         Baron von Gaigern, please... yes... 
                         Baron von Gaigern -- yes...

               While she waits, she moves with a sense of dance.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (again into telephone)
                         Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, 
                         please...
                              (she speaks quietly)
                         Cherie... yes... it is you... 
                         nothing... good morning, good morning, 
                         cherie... nothing... no... just to 
                         tell you I'm happy.

                                                           FADE OUT SLOWLY:

               Bring music up.

                                   END OF SEQUENCE "#3"

                                      SEQUENCE "#4"

               EXT. HOTEL - SIGN

               Music effect over sign "Grand Hotel." Precisely the same 
               angle as before. The sign lights.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK

               The music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key 
               shot of the lobby.

               Senf is busy.

               The Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk. 
               Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is 
               barring the way of an important looking alien.

                                     SENF
                         Step back please.

               Chauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy, 
               happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He 
               does not move but glares at Senf.

                                     SENF
                         I've told you three times -- Baron 
                         von Gaigern is out.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Did he leave any message for me?

                                     SENF
                         No, he did not -- there is no message.

               This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a 
               whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to Senf)
                         Any letters?

                                     SENF
                         No, doctor.

               During this short scene the chauffeur saunters off.

               Kringelein comes to the doctor.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a 
                         day!

               They move away from the scene.

               Kringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following 
               the chauffeur.

               The chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop 
               and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the 
               back of the Baron in the shot.

               CAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron 
               in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop 
               waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of 
               orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot.

                                     BARON
                              (to Senf)
                         Madam Grusinskaya.

                                     SENF
                              (taking the flowers 
                              and handing them to 
                              clerk)
                         For Madam Grusinskaya.

                                     CLERK
                              (to page boy)
                         Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --

                                     SENF
                              (to Baron)
                         Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.

                                     BARON
                              (Quickly -- shortly)
                         All right.
                              (he glances around 
                              apprehensively)

               Kringelein is speaking to the doctor.

               The Baron approaches them.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Baron, we must have gone a hundred 
                         miles an hour, at least...

                                     BARON
                         Yes, quite.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to doctor)
                         We've been together all day... and 
                         in an aeroplane.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best 
                         shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, 
                         silk -- feels so nice on the skin... 
                         a London hat, see -- made in England, 
                         that's silk, too -- fifty marks... 
                         Look, the price is on it. That was 
                         half my salary before. The Baron is 
                         a very fine gentleman -- no one in 
                         my life has been so nice to me as 
                         the Baron.

               The Baron smiles. He slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat.

                                     BARON
                         I'm going to change and we'll meet 
                         for a drink in the Yellow Room.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         In the Yellow Room, where the music's 
                         playing and the ladies are?

                                     BARON
                              (amused)
                         Where the music's playing and the 
                         ladies are...

               The Baron leaves.

                                     DOCTOR
                         No pain, Mr. Kringelein?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I 
                         had pain I'd be too happy to notice 
                         it...

               NOTE: Find cut here.

               While Kringelein is talking, they move away from the CAMERA.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FLASH OF BARON'S ROOM

               The Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns 
               up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed 
               under the door, glances at it.

               FLASH INSERT OF THE PAPER

               In scrawl: "I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY. WILL BE OUTSIDE OR 
               AT THE GARAGE." "S"

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               BARON

               We again see the apprehension on the Baron's face. He crosses, 
               closes the window. As he does so we hear the noise from the 
               conference room.

               Bring up noise from the conference room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CONFERENCE ROOM

               We must have the feeling that these men have been arguing 
               all day. Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains 
               of some sandwiches. In other words it is a business 
               battlefield. Preysing is drawn and tired. Zinnowitz is on 
               his feet. Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a 
               pretty picture.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         ...and let me say again for the tenth 
                         time...
                              (he is hoarse and 
                              tired)
                         ...you people were quite ready for 
                         the merger. You declared yourselves... 
                         fully agreed on all the terms -- Why 
                         should the signing of these articles 
                         be suddenly held up?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         I've admitted that at one time we 
                         had reason for desiring ther merger -- 
                         What reason have we now? The Preysing 
                         Company has fallon upon evil days, 
                         very evil days.

               Preysing jumps to his feet.

                                     PREYSING
                         Evil days -- I've shown you here --
                              (he bangs the paper)
                         -- my company exports to the Balkans 
                         alone, sixty-five thousand marks 
                         worth of mop rags a year.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're 
                         interested in something quite 
                         different!

                                     PREYSING
                         What?

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                              (to Gerstenkorn -- 
                              with a sigh)
                         Shall I tell them again?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (glancing at his watch)
                         Why waste time -- it's getting late.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                         You see -- what we are interested in --

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (interrupting)
                         Ah, come on -- we're going home.

               Due to the long tedious session the men's collars are wilted.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                              (rising)
                         Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a 
                         regard for certainties...

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         You've talked enough today, you're 
                         hoarse now.

               IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING

               His hand goes to his pocket. Slowly he takes out the telegram 
               and glances at it. The following scene is played over this 
               closeup.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Sorry, Preysing.
                              (he gets his hat)

                                     PREYSING
                              (nervously)
                         You've decided against the merger?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Yes --

                                     PREYSING
                         Then, it's all over?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Yes --

                                     WAITZ
                              (to Zinnowitz)
                         Well -- well -- You could call my 
                         office.

               There is a general movement to go.

               FLASH OF TELEGRAM

               Trembling in Preysing's hand. "DEAL WITH MANCHESTER DEFINITELY 
               OFF."

               GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM

               Gerstenkorn crosses to Preysing.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull 
                         through. This is a very bad time to 
                         be in such a crisis. We've...

                                     PREYSING
                              (interrupting)
                         Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- 
                         it's finished. You've broken off 
                         negotiations. You did it. You're 
                         calling them off. You had nothing on 
                         your mind all day, but Manchester, -- 
                         Manchester -- Manchester.
                              (he develops almost a 
                              passion)
                         You don't suppose for one moment 
                         that I'm such a fool as not to have 
                         something that I could say definitely 
                         about Manchester.
                              (he is generating 
                              almost a passion)

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         What?

                                     PREYSING
                         Oh no -- no -- the session is over. 
                         Let's go, it's off. Thank you, 
                         gentlemen.
                              (he starts packing up 
                              his papers.)

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         If you actually have news from 
                         Manchester then...

                                     PREYSING
                         Gentlemen, I am now free to 
                         announce...
                              (he is perspiring, 
                              his hands are 
                              trembling)
                         ...that the deal between my firm and 
                         the Manchester Cotton Company has 
                         been successfully negotiated.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Preysing, you're joking with us.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                         You're a deep one.

               QUICK CLOSEUP OF ZINNOWITZ 

               GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         In that case give us the articles. 
                         We'll sign at once. We know all the 
                         details...

                                     PREYSING
                              (smiling, slowly folds 
                              up the telegram and 
                              puts it back in his 
                              pocket)
                         I thought we'd suspended negotiations, 
                         gentlemen.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Under these circumstances it's quite 
                         a different matter.

                                     PREYSING
                         Under these circumstances we might 
                         refuse to sign.

               By this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon 
               the table.

               Preysing is perspiring.

               Gerstenkorn puts his arms around Preysing's shoulders.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Come on -- business is business -- 
                         Come on --

               Preysing stands, looking ahead of him.

               Gerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them, looks at 
               Waitz.

               Flaemmchen is awakening.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Here's my signature -- here Preysing, 
                         sign here.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         What a session this has been.

               While Preysing is signing.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                         It's twenty-five to six.

                                     WAITZ
                         We should celebrate this with a bottle 
                         of wine.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (with his hat and 
                              coat)
                         See you soon, Preysing. Next week 
                         we'll meet and discuss further 
                         details.

                                     PREYSING
                         Next week.

               Hasty hand-shaking, business of exits.

               Waitz, Gerstenkorn and Schweimann out.

               Preysing has not moved.

               Zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry 
               the signature.

                                     PREYSING
                              (to himself)
                         Next week.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         You let me talk till I'm hoarse and 
                         you had Manchester sewed-up all the 
                         time. Why?

               Preysing does not answer.

               Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Well -- the deal has been put through.

               Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes, it has been put through -- it 
                         has been put through.

               During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, 
               glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions 
               to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing 
               is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying 
               not to attract attention.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                              (to Preysing)
                         What's the matter with you?

                                     PREYSING
                              (hysterically)
                         Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         What's bluff?

                                     PREYSING
                              (throwing the telegram 
                              on the table)
                         That.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                              (reading at out loud)
                         'Deal with Manchester definitely 
                         off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have 
                         thought it of you.

                                     PREYSING
                         No one would have thought it of me. 
                         I've been getting rusty in 
                         Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what 
                         the world wants I guess I can put up 
                         as big a bluff as anyone. From now 
                         on...
                              (he turns away)

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         You must go to Manchester at once 
                         yourself and really see it through.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes -- I must go to England -- I was 
                         desperate -- Now I don't care -- 
                         This sort of thing goes to a man's 
                         head.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         What you need is some relaxation.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd 
                         like to tear loose -- I'd like a 
                         drink. I'd like to go down to that 
                         dancing place. I'd like to start 
                         something.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         I can understand that -- after your -- 
                         uh --

                                     PREYSING
                         Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's 
                         the first time in thirty years that 
                         I've ever... Where's that 
                         stenographer? Miss Flaemm...

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         What do you want with her?

                                     PREYSING
                         I want to see her, I want to do some 
                         dictating -- report of the conference 
                         for my father-in-law.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         She had an engagement in the Yellow 
                         Room at five o'clock -- she was in a 
                         hurry.

                                     PREYSING
                         Zinnowitz, would you say she was 
                         pretty?

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Pretty as a picture.

                                     PREYSING
                         Let's go down and find her -- I need 
                         a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.
                              (he is picking up 
                              papers)
                         I don't know anything about women -- 
                         been married for twenty-six years.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does 
                         it. Goodnight.

               Preysing is very excited, they start to leave -- at that 
               moment the telephone rings.

                                     PREYSING
                         Aeh!

               He crosses to the telephone.

                                     PREYSING
                              (into telephone)
                         Hello... Father-in-law?... Is that 
                         you?... The agreement is signed -- I 
                         did it... yes, father-in-law... but 
                         now I must go to Manchester.

               When he picks the telephone up his hands are shaking -- 

                                                       DISSOLVE HANDS INTO:

               COCKTAIL SHAKER

               -- which shakes more. Music crashes up --

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO BAR

               Kringelein and the Doctor are just entering. Kringelein is 
               changed. His hair has been cut short and his moustache is 
               gone, he looks almost saucy.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to barman)
                         Barman -- whiskey --
                              (to Kringelein)
                         For you, Mr. Kringelein?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         For me? -- Oh, please, something 
                         sweet and cold.

                                     BARMAN
                         A Louisiana flip, sir?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         A Louisiana flip, that sounds very 
                         nice -- sweet, eh? --

               During the following speech Kringelein keeps reaching for 
               the moustache that is not there. He is thoroughly happy.

                                     DOCTOR
                         What do you do in the Grand Hotel? 
                         Eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do 
                         business -- flirt a little -- dance 
                         a little. A hundred doors to one 
                         hall and nobody knows anything about 
                         the person next to him. When you 
                         leave another takes your room and 
                         lies in your bed -- the end.

               At that moment Flaemmchen enters.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- 
                         Where's the Baron?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm waiting for him here. The Baron 
                         and I have been together all day. A 
                         hundred miles an hour -- in a motor 
                         car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was 
                         marvelous --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Mr. Kringelein -- How you have 
                         changed, you look so nice.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, 
                         please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, 
                         Miss Flaemm, won't you have something 
                         sweet -- a Louisiana flip.
                              (to barman)
                         A Louisiana flip.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (to barman)
                         No - absinthe.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (amazed)
                         Yes -- that --

               Kringelein is beating time to the music -- a little carried 
               away.

               Flaemmchen laughs.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You like music?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man 
                         might --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (mischievously)
                         A man might what?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I don't know -- I'd like to do 
                         anything --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (very quietly)
                         Oh -- you would!

               The Baron enters quickly.

                                     BARON
                              (to Flaemmchen)
                         Hello -- sorry I'm late.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- 
                         A Louisiana flip?

                                     BARON
                         Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you 
                         feel now?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         A little strange, Baron.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I'd given you up.

                                     BARON
                              (to Flaemmchen)
                         Sorry.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?

                                     BARON
                         No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Dance then?
                              (they exit)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to Doctor)
                         She's beautiful -- isn't she?

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to Kringelein)
                         Oh -- there are plenty of women.

               BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN DANCING

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         What have you been doing all day?

                                     BARON
                         Chasing around.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Chasing what?

                                     BARON
                         Money.

               They dance a few steps, in silence.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You were very different yesterday.

                                     BARON
                         Yesterday -- yes -- that was 
                         yesterday.

               They dance into the crowd.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               BAR

                                     DOCTOR
                         Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting 
                         what you're looking for?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         What, Doctor?

                                     DOCTOR
                         A masculine paradise -- drink, the 
                         ladies, dancing...

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I had a very good opportunity, a 
                         young lady asked me to dance -- I 
                         ought to be able to dance, it seems 
                         to be very important.

                                     DOCTOR
                         You must learn as quickly as your 
                         time allows -- Believe me Mr. 
                         Kringelein, a man who isn't with a 
                         woman is a dead man.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you 
                         anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you 
                         all alone in the world.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (quietly)
                         I'm always alone -- I have been 
                         everything.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Everything?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I was sent as a military surgeon to 
                         South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken 
                         prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. 
                         I was a surgeon in the Great War 
                         till the end. Grenade in the face. 
                         Carried diphtheria bacilli in the 
                         wound until 1920. Isolated two years.
                              (pause)
                         I've been everything.

               The music has stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN ON DANCE FLOOR

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         That was lovely.

                                     BARON
                         Will you do me a big favor?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I'll do anything for you.

                                     BARON
                         Would you like to make a man happy?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (quietly)
                         Yes -- I'd love to.

                                     BARON
                         Then dance the next number with 
                         Kringelein.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Why?

                                     BARON
                         I feel sorry for him.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're not a bit like you were 
                         yesterday.

                                     BARON
                         I fell in love last night -- the 
                         real thing.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh -- there's no real thing -- it 
                         doesn't exist.

                                     BARON
                         I thought that, too -- but I found 
                         that it does. Come along, dance with 
                         Kringelein.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Anything for you.

               They move off. As they approach the bar, happily Preysing 
               pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm.

                                     PREYSING
                         Miss Flaemm.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Hello!

                                     PREYSING
                         I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (with the Baron)
                         Presently, Mr. Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                         It's urgent.

                                     BARON
                         Pardon me, the lady has urgent 
                         business here with me.

                                     PREYSING
                              (to himself)
                         Insolent -- Berlin manners.

               At that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and 
               crosses to Preysing.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I wish you a very good evening, Mr. 
                         Preysing. You are staying here, too, 
                         Mr. Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                         I don't know you.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein 
                         at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, 
                         building C, room twenty-three -- 
                         third floor.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (quickly)
                         Come and dance with me, Mr. 
                         Kringelein.

                                     PREYSING
                         I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- 
                         business.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (lightly)
                         Tomorrow morning.

                                     PREYSING
                         No -- now.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Do you gentlemen know each other, 
                         Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- 
                         Baron von Gaigern.

               They bow stiffly.

                                     PREYSING
                         Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend 
                         and not accept your invitation to 
                         dance.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I could not think of not accepting.

                                     PREYSING
                         You say that you are employed by us 
                         in Fredersdorf, and here you are in 
                         Berlin, indulging in diversions which 
                         ill befit your position and which 
                         are very much beyond your means -- 
                         Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, 
                         I think we will look into your books.

               Kringelein stands watching Preysing, his eyes narrowing.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Now, children, no fighting -- save 
                         that for the office. Let's have our 
                         dance.
                              (her arms go around 
                              Kringelein. They 
                              dance off)

                                     PREYSING
                         I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.

                                     BARON
                         Oh, let the poor devil alone.

                                     PREYSING
                         I did not ask your advice.

               The two men eye each other; for a moment there might be a 
               fight.

                                     BARON
                         I think it would be much better if 
                         you went away.

                                     PREYSING
                         We shall see who remains here the 
                         longer.

                                     BARON
                              (shrugging his 
                              shoulders)
                         As you will.

               Preysing leans against the bar, orders a cognac. The Baron 
               turns his back to him, watching the dancing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FAEMMCHEN AND KRINGELEIN ON FLOOR

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You must look at my face and not at 
                         the floor.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're trembling.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I never danced before -- in public.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You dance splendidly.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Really?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         For the first time in my life, I'm 
                         happy.

               Kringelein shows signs of exhaustion.

               Flaemmchen watches him quickly.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Let's stop -- I'm tired.

               It is obvious that she has stopped because of Kringelein's 
               distress.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Thank you, Miss Flaemm.

               They move back to the bar. Preysing catches Flaemmchen's 
               arm.

                                     PREYSING
                         Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?

                                     PREYSING
                         You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Does the world belong to you, Mr. 
                         Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                         What is this insolence?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Do you think you have free license 
                         to be insulting? Believe me you have 
                         not. You think you're superior, but 
                         you're quite an ordinary man.

                                     PREYSING
                         Go away -- go away.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Please -- please!

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You don't like to see me enjoying 
                         myself.

                                     PREYSING
                         Who are you? -- An embezzler most 
                         likely.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         An embezzler -- you're going to take 
                         that back, right here in the presence 
                         of this young lady -- who do you 
                         think you're talking to? You think 
                         I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot 
                         dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate 
                         Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                         You're discharged.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Me?

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get 
                         out -- you're discharged.

               Kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor. 
               Flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it.

               Kringelein starts to laugh.

               The Baron steps into the scene.

               The Doctor slowly comes from the bar.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You can't discharge me -- I'm my own 
                         master now -- at last. I'm ill, I'm 
                         going to die -- do you understand? 
                         I'm going to die very soon. Nothing 
                         can happen to me now. Nobody can do 
                         anything any more to me. By the time 
                         you can have discharged me I shall 
                         have been dead already.
                              (his laugh becomes a 
                              convulsive sob)

               The Baron steps between the two looking straight into 
               Preysing's face.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Come, Mr. Kringelein.
                              (he pulls him out of 
                              the scene towards 
                              the bar)

                                     PREYSING
                              (his fists clenched, 
                              between his teeth)
                         The man's insane -- he acts as if he 
                         is glad he is going to die...
                              (hesitates -- to 
                              Flaemmchen)
                         I shall see you in the lobby in half 
                         an hour.

                                    END SEQUENCE "#4"

                                      SEQUENCE "#5"

               FADE IN:

               KEY SHOT OF LOBBY OVER SENF'S HEAD

               General activity.

               The house detective, later identified, is talking to the 
               chauffeur. He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf.

                                     HOUSE DETECTIVE
                         Better let him stay -- I've sent for 
                         the Baron... How's your wife coming 
                         along?

                                     SENF
                         I was at the hospital all night 
                         walking up and down the corridor. 
                         They wouldn't let me in to see her. 
                         She has the pains, but the child 
                         doesn't come and I have to stay here 
                         chained to this desk.

                                     HOUSE DETECTIVE
                         It will be all right.

                                     SENF
                         I hope so.

               At that moment Preysing enters.

                                     PREYSING
                         Did you send that page?

                                     SENF
                         The young lady's there, sir.

               Preysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking 
               around.

               Preysing crosses to Flaemmchen.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                         Sit here.
                              (calls to a boy)
                         Cognac -- for you?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Nothing.

               At that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass.

               Preysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes.

                                     PREYSING
                         I'm going to keep an eye on that 
                         Kringelein fellow. I'll find out 
                         where he gets the money to hang around 
                         the Grand Hotel.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Well -- you want me?

                                     PREYSING
                              (looks straight at 
                              her)
                         Yes.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Well?

                                     PREYSING
                         I must go to England -- at once.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Well?

                                     PREYSING
                         You see, I'd like to take a secretary 
                         with me for my correspondence and --
                         humm -- humm -- for company on the 
                         trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- 
                         I don't know if you quite understand 
                         me. You said you have travelled with 
                         gentlemen -- and I mean --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I understand perfectly.

                                     PREYSING
                         What do you think your salary would 
                         be -- for such a trip?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Wait -- I must figure it up.
                              (she smokes and thinks)
                         First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- 
                         it's cold in England in March, I'll 
                         need a suit... You'd want me to look 
                         nice?

                                     PREYSING
                         Of course -- of course.
                              (he is fidgeting)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         A thousand marks --
                              (she waits anxiously 
                              thinking it might be 
                              too much)

                                     PREYSING
                         It's agreed -- I will get a room 
                         here for you.

               She is looking away.

                                     PREYSING
                         I can get a room here in the Grand 
                         Hotel for you.

               She still looks away.

                                     PREYSING
                         Can you pay some attention to me?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh, yes.

                                     PREYSING
                              (looking off)
                         Insolent young cub!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You mean Baron von Gaigern?

                                     PREYSING
                         Baron!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Well, he's a gentleman!

               THE BARON

               Who is leaning against a chair by a pillar with Kringelein.

               THE CAMERA APPROACHES THEM.

               They are not speaking. The Baron is looking off at:

               FLASH A SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE OF CHAUFFEUR

               Sauntering between the door and Senf's desk.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               THE BARON

               He slumps on the arm of the chair.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (watching him)
                         The Baron is tired?

                                     BARON
                         No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --
                              (he shrugs his 
                              shoulders)
                         Well -- well --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could 
                         go to the Casino -- the place we 
                         passed with the marvelous bright 
                         lights?

                                     BARON
                         I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- 
                         I am broke!

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --

               The Baron looks off, sees the chauffeur --

                                                                    CUT IN:

               FLASH OF CHAUFFEUR

               Arguing with Senf.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               BARON

                                     BARON
                         Excuse me, Mr. Kringelein.
                              (he strides off)

               Keep the CAMERA on Kringelein as he watches the Baron.

               He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing 
               to count it. The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron 
               money. Charming scene.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARON AND CHAUFFEUR

               Moving into position. They are talking.

                                     BARON
                              (quietly)
                         I've quit.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You can't.

                                     BARON
                         I'm not going to get those pearls 
                         and neither are you.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         What about the money?

                                     BARON
                         I'll pay you back.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         How?

                                     BARON
                         I have an idea working in my head...
                              (he glances at 
                              Kringelein)

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You might find a bullet through that 
                         head...

                                     BARON
                         If you did that, you'd get nothing 
                         except the police after you. If you 
                         wait -- I'll give you your six 
                         thousand back --

               At that moment a voice is heard.

                                     VOICE
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car -- Madam 
                         Grusinskaya's car.

               It is passed along.

                                     INSIDE PORTER
                              (calls through his 
                              little telephone)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car --

                                     MEGAPHONE
                              (outside)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car --

                                     BARON
                              (quickly to chauffeur)
                         Later.
                              (Chauffeur exits with 
                              bad grace.)

               Baron looks off...

               FULL SHOT -- FROM HIS ANGLE

               Like a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot. 
               Music comes up.

               Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim. 
               People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward.

               As she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly 
               aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (to them)
                         Go on please -- go on, Suzette.

               She and the Baron are alone.

                                     BARON
                              (quietly)
                         Bless you...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- 
                         I shall dance tonight -- How I shall 
                         dance -- I want to feel that you are 
                         in the theatre.

                                     BARON
                         I can't.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         No?

                                     BARON
                         No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- 
                         the pearls. You wear them now...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why do you think --

                                     BARON
                         Why?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         They've brought me such good luck -- 
                         you --

               He takes her hand, kisses it quietly.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I'm worried about you.

                                     BARON
                         Don't.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         On the train?

                                     BARON
                         Yes -- I will be on the train.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Till then.

                                     BARON
                         Bless you --

               During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As 
               Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the 
               Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his 
               mind miles away.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Was the Baron joking, or is it really 
                         true that the Baron is -- in financial 
                         straits.

                                     BARON
                              (lightly)
                         Absolutely true, Kringelein and I 
                         have to raise some money immediately.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         If the Baron -- if you would permit 
                         me --

               The Baron looks at him suddenly.

                                     BARON
                         What?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I would be awfully glad to oblige, 
                         you've been so decent to me. Three 
                         hundred?

                                     BARON
                         If I could get into a game I might 
                         win some.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Gambling! I'd like that. I have over 
                         six thousand eight hundred marks 
                         with me.

                                     BARON
                         If we could scare up some men to 
                         play.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         We could come to my room.

                                     BARON
                              (with enthusiasm)
                         Good!

               At that moment Flaemmchen passes.

                                     BARON
                         Going?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes --

               Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something 
               that is on her mind.

               A curious little scene.

               She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door. 
               The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to 
               Kringelein.

                                     BARON
                         Ready, Kringelein?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Ready, Baron.

               They move off and are last in the crowd.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                   END OF SEQUENCE "#5"

                                      SEQUENCE "#6"

               No scenes 88-93 inclusive

               Sequence omitted from original script.

                                                             DISSOLVE INTO:

               KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

               Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are 
               playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc., 
               on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The 
               game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the 
               monotonous words of the players.

               White faced, the Baron has the bank.

               Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach 
               the table.

               Kringelein's back is to us.

               They are smart people, not professional gamblers.

               There is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around 
               tightly. We do not see the cards.

               The following voices are heard:

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                         All right, gentlemen.

                                     VOICES
                         I play -- I play -- Here -- Up -- 
                         Playing --

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         Yes -- me.

               Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Is that too much, Baron?

                                     BARON
                              (glances down at his 
                              own money)
                         No -- not at all.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         All right then.

                                     BARON
                         All right then.

               There is tension in the room. The Baron deals two cards. 
               Kringelein takes cards.

                                     A MAN
                              (quickly)
                         Don't show them.

               Kringelein turns it down. He is like a little boy learning a 
               new game.

               The Baron deals himself a card.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to Baron)
                         What do I do now?

               The Baron is serious. There is enough money on the table to 
               take him to Vienna.

                                     A MAN
                              (next to Kringelein)
                         Turn 'em up.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I 
                         win, don't I --
                              (he turns the card up)

               The Baron rises.

                                     BARON
                         There you are gentlemen.

                                     A MAN
                              (to Kringelein)
                         Will you take the bank, sir?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- I'll take everything gentlemen -- 
                         please, let us drink -- champagne ---
                         champagne is expensive and good. I'm 
                         winning more than I used to earn in 
                         a year -- double what I used to earn.
                              (he is counting his 
                              money)

               They hand him the cards.

               Kringelein kisses the Baron -- he looks around.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Where is the Baron -- where are you, 
                         Baron?

               At the side table the Baron is standing -- he is drinking -- 
               his face is white -- he has lost.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (rising quickly)
                         Excuse me, gentlemen.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (sitting down in 
                              Kringelein's place)
                         I'll take the bank -- All right, 
                         gentlemen.

               Kringelein has come to the Baron.

                                     BARON
                         That was my last.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You've lost everything?

                                     BARON
                         I've no luck.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
                              (he puts bills in 
                              Baron's hand.)

               Baron pours out a glass of champagne -- he has been drinking 
               plenty -- he hands glass to Kringelein.

                                     BARON
                         Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my 
                         last chance.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (earnestly)
                         I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, 
                         Baron and to win.
                              (he drinks)
                         It's good, -- come along, Baron.

               They both move back to the table where the Doctor holds the 
               bank.

                                     BARON
                         I take five hundred.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         All of that at once, Baron?

               The Baron picks cards, shows them to Kringelein who doesn't 
               understand.

                                     BARON
                         Eight.
                              (he is triumphant.)

                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
                              (rings in background)
                         Nine.

               The Baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and 
               turns to Kringelein:

                                     BARON
                         That's it. The luck's with you.
                              (he walks away.)

                         Come along, Mr. Kringelein. Sit here.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm having luck for the first time 
                         in my life.

                                     A MAN
                         Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.

               Kringelein seats himself, puts his glass of champagne down 
               on the table.

               Doctor leaves table, crosses to Baron who is pouring another 
               drink.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Out, Baron?

                                     BARON
                              (bitterly)
                         For a while -- I'll recover -- in 
                         ten or twenty years.
                              (he points)
                         Look at that.

               He has pointed and turned off because we hear Kringelein's 
               voice:

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         I've won again, Baron -- I've won 
                         again.

               Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor. As Baron 
               approaches table.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Baron, I drink and win -- I drink 
                         and win -- I win and drink!
                              (he is pulling money 
                              towards him, counting 
                              it, eagerly, 
                              frantically, not the 
                              movement of a miser, 
                              not a greedy movement, 
                              but the movement of 
                              an excited child 
                              liberated. Money has

                              paper to him.)

               During the foregoing scene, one of the men at the table has 
               answered the ringing of the telephone bell, he comes back 
               now.

                                     A MAN

                         about the noise.

                         You've been very lucky... Where's my

                         Goodnight, Baron. Let's wind up the 
                         game, I'm broke and tired; you can't 
                         play against him. I put my hat down 
                         here, somewhere. I think I'll have a 
                         drink before I go. By the way, I've 
                         got to see you tomorrow morning. 
                         How've you been, Doctor?

               Business ad lib. General business of slow normal exit.

               Kringelein looks up from counting his money. He has been 
               like a little boy with a Christmas stocking. He looks up 
               suddenly, sees men are leaving --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- Stay a 
                         while.
                              (he stands to his 
                              feet)
                         Be my guests!

               By this time the men are pausing by the door.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I oughtn't to presume, but I --
                              (he is a little drunk)
                         I'm so grateful to you -- it's been 
                         so marvelous. The first time in my 
                         life I have gambled -- I've danced! 
                         Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but 
                         it's the first time in my life I've 
                         ever tasted life!

                                     A MAN
                              (slapping him on back)
                         Splendid!

               There is a general feeling in the room that although this 
               man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no 
               wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a 
               nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has 
               reached an emotional pitch.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but 
                         very dangerous. You must have courage 
                         for it, then it's wonderful. You 
                         gentlemen don't know that because 
                         you are all healthy and happy, but I -- 
                         believe me -- a man must know death 
                         and not until then does a man know 
                         anything about life.

                         lamp burns.

               General noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious. 
               Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him 
               goodnight.

               The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's 
               shoulder.

               Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard. The men 
               are nearing the door.

                                     DOCTOR
                         No, the Baron will stay.

                                     BARON
                         Certainly.

               Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully 
               making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows 
               behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his 
               hands are limp.

               By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course 
               know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from 
               Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket.

               We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see 
               his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his 
               inside pocket --

               He stands looking down at Kringelein.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (drops Kringelein's 
                              hand)
                         It will be over in a minute.

               Kringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely:

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Over -- over so soon -- it has just 
                         begun.
                              (he closes his eyes 
                              suddenly)
                         Oh, the pain.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be 
                         afraid.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (mutteringly)
                         I'd like to live a little longer but -- 
                         I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...

                                     BARON
                              (touching his shoulder 
                              gently)
                         You'll be all right, Kringelein.
                              (he moves from the 
                              bed -- takes out a 
                              cigarette, moves to 
                              the table. He seizes 
                              his drink)

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                              (out of scene)
                         My pocketbook... my money in it...

                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
                         What do you say -- what?

               We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.

                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
                         You what -- Oh, isn't it there?

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost 
                         my pocketbook.

               Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them.

               The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat.

                                     DOCTOR
                         There is no pocketbook here... On 
                         the floor probably.
                              (He glances down)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (starting up suddenly)
                         More than fourteen thousand marks... 
                         were in that pocketbook.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (looking at Baron)
                         Fourteen thousand marks... One can 
                         travel -- one's happiness might depend 
                         on fourteen thousand marks -- don't 
                         you think so, Baron?

                                     BARON
                              (with a shrug)
                         Quite possibly.

               At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the 
               ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, I've got to find it.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Stay where you are.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         No -- I must find it --
                              (he starts talking)
                         Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
                              (he pulls himself to 
                              the side of the bed)

               The doctor goes to restrain him.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm all right, Doctor. There's no 
                         pain now -- only you don't know what 
                         that money means to a man like me.

               He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the 
               floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, 
               his condition, makes the situation tragic. He actually gets 
               under the card table.

               The Doctor looks at the Baron.

               The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him, fascinated.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (talking at intervals 
                              as he crawls looking 
                              for money)
                         You don't know, because you've never 
                         lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and 
                         saved and scrimped. My life hangs 
                         upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives 
                         you anything. You have to buy 
                         everything and pay cash for it. I 
                         wanted to pay for my last days with 
                         that money. Every hour costs money. 
                         I've nothing -- nothing but that 
                         pocketbook.
                              (he crawls along the 
                              floor on his hands 
                              and knees talking to 
                              the carpet as he 
                              looks)
                         I must have it back.
                              (he pauses breathless -- 
                              like an animal along 
                              the wall -- looking 
                              up at the men)

               The foregoing speech is intercut with the following action 
               in which Kringelein's voice is heard throughout -- thus it 
               is not a long speech:

               The Baron watches. He throws his cigarette away -- he bites 
               his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a 
               thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped 
               him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity 
               for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the 
               time the Doctor watches.

               The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting 
               conscience.

               Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during 
               rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but 
               piercing, says:

                                     DOCTOR
                         He must find his money, Baron.
                              (next time)
                         Mr. Kringelein should find his 
                         pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?

               These are two interjections.

               And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little 
               sack of pain, his head down.

               The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking 
               for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and 
               turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his 
               voice as he says:

                                     BARON
                         Here -- here it is. Here's your 
                         pocketbook, Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (his head coming up)
                         Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found 
                         it -- you found it for me, Baron.

                                     BARON
                              (quickly)
                         Goodnight, Kringelein.
                              (he moves towards the 
                              door.)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- 
                         don't go -- don't leave me alone, 
                         Baron.

                                     DOCTOR
                         You've nothing to fear, Kringelein

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         No.

                                     BARON
                         Come, get up -- come let me help 
                         you.

               NOTE: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up -- 
               If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.

                                     BARON
                         You're all right now -- it's very 
                         late -- goodnight, Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.

               Baron bites his lip. It is the first and only time in the 
               play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost breaks.

                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
                         Goodnight, Baron.

                                     BARON
                         Goodnight.
                              (his hand presses on 
                              Kringelein's shoulder -- 
                              he exits)

                                                              CUT OUT INTO:

               CORRIDOR

               Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of 
               the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In 
               his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience 
               feel his problem with him.

               This man who has lived and whistled and love through the 
               play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron 
               has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his 
               hair back.

               Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. 
               He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of 
               Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The 
               Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. 
               He walks down the corridor.

                                     BARON
                         Flaemmchen, what are you doing here 
                         in the middle of the night.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Looking for my room -- one sixty-
                         six.

                                     BARON
                         You live here?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         For tonight.
                              (she points to door -- 
                              she looks at him a 
                              long time)

                                     BARON
                         Oh!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes -- oh!

                                     BARON
                         Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         And Baron, thanks so much for 
                         everything.

               They both go into their respective rooms.

               Here are our two gay young characters. The gay, fresh 
               Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of 
               funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about 
               themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically 
               for the want of a little money.

               FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM

               Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp 
               burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining 
               door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts 
               down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his 
               door. She peeps through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FLASH OF PREYSING'S ROOM

               from her angle.

               Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and 
               on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's 
               picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake 
               because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his 
               hand.

               FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN

               An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and 
               he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes 
               the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and 
               takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, 
               lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts 
               at the noise. "Has it awakened him." She looks off.

               SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR

               The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the 
               adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room 
               the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he 
               is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks 
               hoarsely, quietly.

                                     PREYSING
                         Flaemmchen!
                              (he seizes her to him)

               She goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair. 
               She is passive -- cold.

                                     PREYSING
                              (breathlessly)
                         You are late. I've been waiting for 
                         you -- waiting.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I had to arrange about the trip.

                                     PREYSING
                         You're sweet.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You think so?

               He holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately 
               avoids his kiss.

                                     PREYSING
                              (awkwardly)
                         Come here.
                              (he sits heavily on 
                              the bed, sitting on 
                              her night dress.)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Here, hold up!

               Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under 
               him.

               He draws her to him.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                         Call me -- do you know -- would you -- 
                         would you like to call me by my first 
                         name?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (pulling away, glad 
                              of an excuse for 
                              conversation)
                         Oh, no.

                                     PREYSING
                         Why not?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I couldn't do that, you're a stranger 
                         to me.

                                     PREYSING
                         You're a funny little creature, 
                         Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         It's not funny at all. One can't get 
                         intimate just off hand. I could go 
                         to England with you and everything 
                         like that -- supposing I met you 
                         next year and I said: 'How do you 
                         do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:
                              (she imitates him)
                         'That was the young lady who was my 
                         secretary in Manchester'.

               Preysing laughs. She laughs.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         That's all quite proper.
                              (she is happy again. 
                              She would rather 
                              talk than be squeezed)
                         But supposing I met you when you 
                         were with your wife and I called 
                         out: "Hello you big baby -- remember 
                         Manchester?' And you with your wife, 
                         how would you like that?

               There is a pause for a moment.

                                     PREYSING
                         Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my 
                         wife out of this.

               Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         All right. I'll get undressed -- get 
                         out.

               He moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his 
               fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto 
               the balcony.

               Preysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the 
               street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a 
               shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled. 
               Shadow crosses again. "Who can be in his room?" He moves 
               forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French 
               window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively 
               searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar 
               is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. 
               He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face 
               watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, 
               pulling the window after him. The two men face each other.

                                     PREYSING
                         Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want 
                         here?

                                     BARON
                         I must have made a mistake.

                                     PREYSING
                         Made a mistake -- remarkable. We 
                         shall soon see if you made a mistake.
                              (the Baron starts to 
                              leave.)
                              (bellowing)
                         Stay here... Give me that money.

               The Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word.

                                     PREYSING
                         So that's how we stand, Baron.

                                     BARON
                         Look here, sir -- I'm completely at 
                         your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's 
                         a matter of life or death -- I had 
                         to get some money -- tonight.

                                     PREYSING
                         Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. 
                         Humm -- humm, but you must go to 
                         jail, Baron, you're a thief.

                                     BARON
                         Be quiet.

                                     PREYSING
                         I'm going to call the police. I'm 
                         going to watch you play the great 
                         Baron with the police. Aristocrat! 
                         Aristocrat!
                              (he picks up the 
                              telephone)

               The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, 
               pulls at the knob.

                                     PREYSING
                         The door is locked, Baron.

               The Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at 
               his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone, 
               (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and 
               one hand holding the Baron.

                                     PREYSING
                              (into telephone)
                         Hello! Hello! --

                                     BARON
                         Don't do that.
                              (he tries to snatch 
                              the telephone from 
                              Preysing.)

               Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron. 
               The action excites him.

                                     PREYSING
                         Strike me, would you? Attack me would 
                         you? Attack me --

               With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down 
               upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book). 
               In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone.

                                     PREYSING
                         I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- 
                         I'll strike you -- Strike me!

               By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing 
               come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again.

                                     PREYSING
                         I strike you --
                              (with telephone 
                              foolishly in his 
                              hand, he looks down 
                              at what he has done.)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOWNSTAIRS TELEPHONE ROOM

               Sharp sound of buzzing.

               Dozing night girl plugs in, lazily.

                                     NIGHT GIRL
                         Yes -- yes -- Operator -- Operator --
                              (she listens -- says 
                              to herself)
                         They are having a nice little game 
                         up there with the telephone.

               With nonchalance she flicks plug out again, as she does so:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PREYSING'S ROOM

               New angle. Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the 
               receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He 
               is terrified.

               Door opens behind him.

               Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, 
               crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing 
               seizes her.

               Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we 
               think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She 
               is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can 
               hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the 
               traffic below.

               Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, 
               it is the first time we have been conscious of it.

               With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. 
               It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own 
               room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from 
               her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears 
               through her own room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CORRIDOR

               Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that. 
               After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running 
               across the ice in "Way Down East," -- it is Flaemmchen, a 
               Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. "What 
               the hell is this -- what is it." The impulse naturally is to 
               scream in alarm. She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't. She looks 
               around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She 
               will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly. 
               Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

               It is in darkness. The only light comes through the windows. 
               The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor 
               had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers 
               and shirt.

               Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes 
               hanging to her, crosses.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (hoarse whisper)
                         Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Kringelein -- 
                         where are you?

               She sweeps to bed. She shakes him. Kringelein starts up.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- what -- what --
                              (he is looking up at 
                              what seems to be a 
                              ghost.)

               She pulls on the light by the bed, it flames up on their 
               faces.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Quick -- something awful -- awful 
                         has happened. Go -- go at once, -- 
                         Mr. Preysing --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Preysing?

               It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must 
               have been roughly treated by Preysing. He suddenly assumes a 
               strength.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh, don't wait -- go -- it's awful -- 
                         it's awful.

               She slides down to the floor, by the side of the bed.

               Kringelein climbs out of bed, tries to help her up.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Stay here.

               She waves him away.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Don't wait now -- go -- Preysing.

               Kringelein assumes suddenly a strength. He is a man for a 
               crisis -- he forgets that he was ever ill -- he leaves.

               WE GO WITH HIM. CUT HIM DOWN CORRIDOR QUICKLY. He pauses 
               outside Preysing's door, uncertain of the rooms, then he 
               knocks.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (calling)
                         Mr. Preysing -- Oh, Mr. Preysing --

               He feels there must be a mistake -- he steps back, sees 
               Flaemmchen's door open next to it. He enters.

                                                           CUT HIM THROUGH:

               FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM

               He enters. Looks around. Looks through bathroom. Goes quickly 
               forward.

                                                          CUT INTO REVERSE:

               PREYSING'S ROOM

               Preysing is still leaning against the table, his mouth is 
               open, he is gaping -- stunned. The two hundred and four pounds 
               has collapsed and sagged. He is staring, his victim lying -- 
               a heap upon the floor, very still and quiet. His eyes come 
               around as Kringelein enters.

               Kringelein crosses, looks down. Touches the Baron's hand.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.

                                     PREYSING
                         He tried to rob me -- he is dead --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         My best friend -- poor, Baron -- 
                         dead -- just like that.

                                     PREYSING
                         -- We must do something...

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (quickly)
                         Yes, the police must be called.

                                     PREYSING
                         No -- no -- wait -- the man was a 
                         burglar -- he was going to steal my 
                         money.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.

                                     PREYSING
                              (suddenly)
                         Where is that girl -- she was working 
                         with him -- she enticed me into her 
                         room.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- 
                         I understand, Mr. General Director 
                         Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                              (frantically)
                         I can answer for this, it was self-
                         defense -- I can answer for this -- 
                         but that girl -- the scandal -- my 
                         wife -- my daughters, you know them?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes, I know them --

                                     PREYSING
                         The scandal -- we are men -- you -- 
                         you could take that affair of the 
                         young lady upon yourself -- take her 
                         and hold your tongue. Then you can 
                         travel -- I'll give you anything -- 
                         anything -- she was with you.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         We must call the police, your 
                         excellency.

               Preysing takes him by the shoulders.

                                     PREYSING
                         How much -- how much do you want -- 
                         you need money -- you have nothing.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Don't worry about me, Mr. General 
                         Director Pryesing -- worry about 
                         yourself.
                              (he picks up receiver)
                         There has been a murder -- this is 
                         room one sixty-four.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TELEPHONE ROOM

               Telephone girl plugs in.

                                     GIRL
                         Hello -- hurry up... hurry up... 
                         someone in one sixty-four says there 
                         has been a murder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HALL PORTER

               The scene gradually grows intense. Porter calls night man.

                                     PORTER
                         Here - quick - here -- go to one 
                         sixty-four immediately.
                              (calls back on 
                              telephone)
                         Give me Mr. Rohna -- Rohna the 
                         manager.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROHNA'S ROOM

               Darkened room. Bell ringing. Rohna sits up in bed, turns on 
               light, picks up telephone; on his face we see him hear the 
               news.

                                     ROHNA
                         Where?... murder?... who?... all 
                         right, I'm coming. Wait a minute.
                              (speaks in a monotone)
                         Instruct everyone to use the utmost 
                         tact -- we must have no scandal in 
                         the Grand Hotel. Answer no questions, 
                         I'm coming now -- inform the police.

               (he replaces the telephone commences dressing quickly)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               Trunks standing around everywhere. Suzette is finishing 
               packing. Grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a 
               loose night wrap -- she is doing her hair.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam should sleep.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I've done my hair differently -- do 
                         you like that?

                                     SUZETTE
                         When a lady falls in love she does 
                         her hair differently.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (rising)
                         In the middle of the night -- those 
                         flowers make me think of a funeral. 
                         Laurels and tube-roses.
                              (she pushes the window 
                              closed, shivers, it 
                              is chilly. She crosses 
                              the room turning out 
                              one of the lights)
                         Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and 
                         the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- 
                         happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.

                                     SUZETTE
                              (quietly)
                         Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. 
                         It is not long 'till the train.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Goodnight, Suzette.

               Suzette leaves -- turning out a light.

               Alone, Grusinskaya goes to the telephone. She raises the 
               receiver.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Hello -- can you tell me if Baron 
                         von Gaigern is in his room -- ring 
                         him.
                              (talking to herself)
                         Cherie, I must wake you or you'll 
                         miss the train.
                              (into phone)
                         ...yes... are you ringing, he may be 
                         asleep.
                              (to herself)
                         Cherie, you must get up and fetch me 
                         from my room -- I'm longing for you, 
                         Cherie -- I have not been to sleep -- 
                         I kept thinking you would come to 
                         me.
                              (into phone)
                         ...Oh, but he must answer. Ring -- 
                         ring -- ring.

               The trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs 
               of dawn, which we remember after the climax of the first 
               sequence.

               Music cold and eerie.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               General early morning bustle and activity.

               From one van, fruit and vegetables are being unloaded. From 
               another, huge hind quarters of beef are being carried in and 
               in a monotonous way a baker throws two loaves at a time, to 
               another man, from a van backed up --

                                     BAKER
                              (counting)
                         Forty-two -- forty-four -- forty-six -- 
                         forty-eight -- fifty -- fifty-two --

               Waiters coming to work. A noisy racket.

               Sandwiched between the bread and butcher vans, is backed a 
               hearse.

               At the moment we come upon it, the men are pausing in their 
               work to glance. The men take off their caps, as; proceeded 
               by the hotel detective and others, who will be there, the 
               corpse of the Baron in the basket, used at such time, is 
               brought out and placed in the hearse, which drives noisily 
               away. A policeman rides with the driver on the box.

               By this time the man with the bread is counting: 

                                     BAKER
                         One hundred and eight -- one hundred 
                         and ten -- one hundred and twelve...

               Stay with him for a moment.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR FRONT OF HOTEL

               Shooting onto door - day lighting.

               A man comes out and signals a black closed limousine, which 
               pulls forward.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO - MAIN HOTEL LOBBY

               Early morning. Sense of chill and desolation. Some chairs 
               stand on tables. A vacuum cleaner is at work on the carpets. 
               Newspaper boys are delivering papers at the news stand. The 
               various shops are slowly being opened, the windows being 
               cleaned.

               The general feeling of the beginning of another day.

               THE CAMERA waits at a distance shooting from door as Preysing, 
               with a plain clothes man on either side of him, leaves, moving 
               towards THE CAMERA. He is grim, his hat is drawn over his 
               eyes. His hands deep in his pockets. When he has passed the 
               CAMERA MOVES FORWARD TO:

               SENF'S DESK

               (the old shot) Meierheim is entering quickly goes through 
               the door.

               He crosses now to Pimenov. They talk eagerly out of earshot. 
               But it is apparent that Meierheim is, as usual, in a hurry.

               Rohna is there too. One of the men carries a telephone stand, 
               wrapped loosely in paper. But we know it's the telephone 
               stand.

               Senf comes on duty, looks around, it is apparent that he is 
               late.

                                     CLERK
                         The night clerk has already gone -- 
                         you are late.

                                     SENF
                         Man -- I was at the clinic the whole 
                         night -- there are no words to 
                         describe what my wife suffered.

                                     CLERK
                         And the child isn't coming?

                                     SENF
                         No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't 
                         let it interfere with my duty. Any 
                         news here?

                                     CLERK
                         News? Yes -- killing in number one-
                         sixty-four.

                                     SENF
                         What? -- Who? -- Whom?

                                     CLERK
                         The big manufacturer killed Baron 
                         von Gaigern.

                                     SENF
                         Good heavens. What for?

                                     CLERK
                         I don't know.

                                     SENF
                         Man -- that's terrible. He was a 
                         nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.

                                     CLERK
                         It seems that he was a thief and an 
                         imposter.

                                     SENF
                         I don't believe it -- he was a real 
                         gentleman. I know people... I'm so 
                         tired I can hardly see out of my 
                         eyes. No sleep for two nights and so 
                         many duties and now this killing in 
                         the hotel -- that means a lot of 
                         work. But it's too bad about the 
                         Baron, you always felt better when 
                         he came along -- always friendly -- 
                         such an agreeable fellow.

                                     CLERK
                         Most imposters are --

               A number of bellboys march up and form a line. Senf comes 
               from behind the desk and inspects them.

                                     SENF
                         Good morning.

                                     BOYS
                              (in chorus)
                         Good morning.

                                     SENF
                         Show your hands.

               They show their hands.

                                     SENF
                              (to one boy)
                         You have dirty nails -- you little 
                         pig -- you're no good... Caps off! -- 
                         Let's see your hair.
                              (Boys take off their 
                              caps)
                         Good -- caps on!
                              (Boys put on their 
                              caps)
                         Where is number seven?... Not here?
                              (to clerk)
                         Take his name -- if he comes late 
                         again today, he's fired. Dismissed!

               The boys sit down on the bench.

               THE CAMERA MOVES TO KRINGELEIN.

               Kringelein and the police officer move towards the desk in 
               ear shot.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Please, officer.

                                     OFFICER
                         That will be sufficient for the 
                         present, sir, you may travel in peace.

               Kringelein exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CORRIDOR BY ELEVATOR

               As Kringelein emerges from the elevator, Suzette speaking to 
               the Floor Clerk.

                                     SUZETTE
                         And they've taken him away.

                                     FLOOR CLERK
                         Yes -- it's terrible.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam must not know -- you understand -- 
                         Madam must not know.

                                     FLOOR CLERK
                         I will tell the maids. I cannot answer 
                         for downstairs --

               Suzette hurries down corridor. By this time Kringelein has 
               arrived at his door, he opens it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

               Kringelein opens the door and enters. Flaemmchen is looking 
               into space. A lovely picture. Morning light over her hair, 
               she is dressed.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         What's the matter?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- 
                         Lying there, his eyes so open.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You loved the Baron, didn't you?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         So did I. He was friendly to me as 
                         no man ever was.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Perhaps he really was a burglar -- 
                         But they don't kill a man for that.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         He was in desperate straits. He'd 
                         been trying to raise money all day. 
                         He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a 
                         man like Preysing kills him.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (naively)
                         I didn't like Preysing right off.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Then why did you have anything to do 
                         with him?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (simply)
                         Money!

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes, of course, -- money!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You don't understand that do you?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Of course I do -- I never knew what 
                         money really meant till I started 
                         spending it. Do you know --
                              (he is silent a moment)
                         I can hardly believe that anything 
                         so beautiful should come to me from 
                         Preysing -- I'll take care of you. 
                         Will -- will you let me?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         What?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You'll have a good time with me. 
                         Want to? I've got enough money. Ten 
                         thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. 
                         Three thousand four hundred that I 
                         won. It will last a long time. I can 
                         win more -- we'll travel.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there 
                         always.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Wherever you like. Here I'll give 
                         you the money I won, three thousand 
                         four hundred. Later you can have 
                         more.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Later?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It 
                         will not be long -- I'll not last 
                         long. Will you stay with me until...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, 
                         he'll cure you. They can cure anything 
                         these days.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Do you believe that you will have a 
                         better time with me than you would 
                         with Preysing?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh yes, of course.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (takes her hands)
                         Do you like me better?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- 
                         a very good man.

               Kringelein straightens, happy, inspired, a smile on his face. 
               He assumes in his gestures. Takes the telephone.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (into telephone)
                         When is the next train leaving for 
                         Paris? -- Yes... Get two tickets for 
                         me... and my bill please... and the 
                         lady's -- Miss Flaemm's.
                              (puts down telephone)
                              (to Flaemmchen)
                         We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll 
                         have breakfast on the train.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CORRIDOR

               The figure of Grusinskaya is standing at her door, there is 
               no one with her. Suzette steps out.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is 
                         waiting downstairs.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
                              (she looks off.)

               FLASH OF PIMENOV

               coming out of the elevator.

               Grusinskaya hurries down to Pimenov -- they meet.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (breathlessly)
                         He will be on the train.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         But when did he go? How do you know?

               She crosses and looks in the Baron's room. A maid is there 
               changing the bedding. The room is unoccupied otherwise.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Baron von Gaigern has left?

               The maid nods.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         When? How long ago?

               Maid shrugs her shoulders.

                                     VOICE OF FLOOR CLERK
                         The Baron left about half an hour 
                         ago, Madam.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Oh -- Gru -- come, come -- we'll 
                         lose the train.

               While they are waiting for the elevator Grusinskaya is like 
               a live electric wire.

               The elevator arrives. They are stepping in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LOBBY

               General activity. We hear the cry go up:

                                     VOICE
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car...

               Grusinskaya comes out of the elevator followed by Suzette 
               and Pimenov. Meierheim meets her.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Come along, oh, Madam, come along. 
                         The train will be going.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.

                                     PIMENOV
                         What's the use of asking, Gru -- he 
                         is at the train -- He will be there.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         The troupe, the scenery, everything -- 
                         all on board, waiting. You have a 
                         rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. 
                         Come, Madam, are you mad?

               Grusinskaya crosses to the desk. She speaks to Senf.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Have you seen Baron von Gaigern?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         He is gone?

                                     ROHNA
                         Yes, Madam.

                         Four minutes past. Please come.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- 
                         he will be there.

                         Madam Grusinskaya's car.

               Grusinskaya, followed by the others, sweeps out towards the 
               door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXTERIOR HOTEL

               Grusinskaya emerges, followed by the others. The sunlight 
               hits them.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in 
                         Tremezzo --

                         sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest

                         There's been -- a child born? A boy! 
                         Yes! My child born! It is healthy...

               At this moment Kringelein and Flaemmchen are coming out of 
               the elevator, Kringelein is carrying his suitcase.

               A bellboy attempts to take his bag but Kringelein, still 
               confused draws his hand with the suitcase away from the 
               bellboy.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Let him take it.

                         Your bag, your Excellency --

               Hearing the word 'Excellency' Kringelein goes through a 
               transformation. He stands and with a flourish hands the 
               suitcase over to the boy. He is a big man now.

                                     KRINGELEIN

                         And now we travel, Flaemmchen...

                         How do you know there is a Grand 
                         Hotel?

                         Oh, there must be one in Paris... 
                         They have everything in Paris.

                         Your bill, Your Excellency.

               Kringelein pays and taking Flaemmchen's arm starts to move 
               away from the desk, General business ad lib of tipping. Boys 
               line up, making a deep bow. There is almost a triumphant 
               march as Kringelein and Flaemmchen move towards the door.

                                     SENF CLERK BOYS
                              (in chorus)
                         Come again, your Excellency.

               With head erect, happy smile on his face, Kringelein leaves 
               the lobby. Normal activity in lobby, reminding us of opening 
               scene. Doctor comes up to desk.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Was that Mr. Kringelein leaving?

              Screenplay by Frank Darabont

              from the novel by Stephen King

              First Draft
              11/4/97


              "We each owe a death, there are no exceptions..."

              --------------------------------------------------------------

              A SONG BEGINS, distant as a faded memory on an old Victrola:

              Once I built a railroad, made it run... Made it race against
              time...Once I built a railroad, now it's done...Brother, can
              you spare a dime...

              Opening credit sequence

              plays against footage of the Great Depression, images
              haunting and sepia-toned, defining an era. The bread
              lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading
              west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in
              their eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their
              bootleg riches...an entire generation of lost youth riding
              the rials...the U.S. army troops raining truncheon blows on
              the half-starved and forgotten veterans of World War One as
              "Hooverville" is set afire in the very shadow of the nation's
              capitol...

              All these faces, all these lives, in a world not really so
              very long ago...

              EXT. FIELD - DAY(SLOW MOTION)

              ...where cattails sway in the sepia-toned heat. A small scrap
              of fabric is snagged in the nettles, fluttering languidly...

              COLOR BLEEDS SLOWLY IN as mosquitoes swarm and dragonflies
              skitter, showing the fabric scrap to be pale yellow...

              Suddenly, a MAN WITH A SHOTGUN comes crashing through the
              cattails, wiping through frame and exiting...

              ...then ANOTHER MAN...and ANOTHER...armed with rifles,
              plowing through the brush, exiting frame...

              ...and now comes KLAUS DETTERICK, a farmer one step above
              shirt-tail poor, a double-barrel shotgun in the crook of his
              arm. He pauses, horrified, seeing the scrap of cloth. He
              pulls it loose, turns back, screaming something in anguish...

              ...and still more men come crashing into view, flooding by us
              with dreamlike, slow-motion grace. ONE MAN is leading a team
              of DOGS, trying to untangle the leads. DEPUTY ROB McGEE is
              shouting for everybody to stay together...

              ...and under it all, we hear a sibilant, frightening whisper:

                                  WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
                        You love your sister? You make any
                        noise, know what happens?

              And off that horrible voice, we

              INT. GEORGIA PINES NURSING HOME - MORNING(PRESENT DAY)

              A CLOCK RADIO spews the morning weather report, abruptly
              pulling us into the present with a prediction of rain. PAUL
              EDGECOMB, late 70's/early 80's, wakes to another day...

              INT. PAUL'S ROOM - MORNING

              Paul stands at his bathroom mirror, meticulously buttoning
              his shirt. He picks up a hairbrush, starts tidying his hair...

              INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING

              THE OLD AND INFIRM haunt these corridors like ghosts. A WOMAN
              inches along on a walker. A MAN shuffles by with a rolling
              I.V. stand. The floor is a limey, institutional green.

              Paul comes into view, spry for his age, murmurs an occasional
              greeting.

              INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING

              DOZENS OF RETIREES are having breakfast, sipping weak coffee
              or tea. Some chat and gossip, other are content to keep their
              own company, some just stare slackly into space.

              Paul enters, sees ELAINE CONNELLY sitting with a few other
              ladies, sipping tea. She's 80, refined and elegant, his best
              friend here. She gives him a good-morning smile. He gives her
              a rakish wink in return, which makes her smiles all the more.

              Paul reaches past the people at the counter and sneaks two
              pieces of cold leftover toast off a serving plate. He tosses
              Elaine another look--catch ya later--and exits.

              INT. HALLWAY PAST KITCHEN - MORNING

              Paul slips to the back door unnoticed. Identical red plastic
              rain ponchos line the wall on pegs. He helps himself to one
              and eases outside, making good his escape.

              EXT. NURSING HOME - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

              Nestled in a valley of wooded hills, a drizzly mist rolling
              over the treetops.

              Paul appears f.g., coming up the ridge in his borrowed
              poncho. He looks back at the valley below, inhales deeply--
              this is a man who loves his walks.

              He pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to
              nibble as he presses up on the ridge...

              Low angle: nursing home and ridge beyond

              ...and we see Paul from a distance, just a speck trudging up
              toward the treeline. A PICKUP TRUCK rumbles into frame and
              parks, a bumper sticker looming large: "I Have Seen God and
              His Name Is Newt Gingrich".

              BRAD DOLAN gets out, an orderly in his late 20's/early 30's,
              arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt. He gazes
              up toward the ridge, scowling and muttering softly:

                                  BRAD
                        Old fuck.

              He slams the door and heads for the nursing home...

              EXT. WOODS - MORNING

              ...as CAMERA BOOMS DOWN through the trees to find Paul
              wandering a wooded path, munching a tidbit of toast, looking
              for all the world like Red Riding Hood in his plastic poncho.

              It's silent here, like a church. The only sounds we hear are
              the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the
              woodpecker.

              A RUSTLING SOUND makes Paul freeze. He turns, becomes
              transfixed. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        Oh, my...

              Reverse angle

              reveals a magnificent BUCK, not twenty feet away, misty
              breath punching the cold morning air. They watch each other
              for an endless moment, both standing stock still...

              ...and then the animal bounds away, vanishing into the
              foliage. Paul lets out a breath, shakes his head in wonder.
              He takes another bite of toast, moves on...

              ...and WE PAN WITH HIM to reveal a pair of old wooden storage
              shacks along the path up ahead.

              INT. SHACK - MORNING

              Dark in here, cobwebby and decrepit. We see Paul approaching
              outside the grimy window. He steps up to the glass and shades
              his eyes, peering curiously in as we

              EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

              Paul approaches the back door, returning from his walk. He
              reaches for the knob...and a figure in white lunges from
              behind the dumpster to grab his wrist. He whirls, gasping in
              fright--it's Brad Dolan, wearing his orderly's uniform.

                                  BRAD
                        Out for a little stroll, Paulie?

                                  PAUL
                        Let go...

              Paul tries to pull away, but Dolan's got him tight.

                                  BRAD
                        What's with this poncho you got
                        on, huh? This isn't yours.

                                  PAUL
                        I got it off the wall there.
                        There's a whole row of them.

                                  BRAD
                        But not for you, Paulie, that's
                        the thing. Those are for the staff.

                                  PAUL
                        I just borrowed it. Don't see what
                        harm it does.

                                  BRAD
                        It's not about harm, it's about
                        rules. You probably don't think an
                        old fart like you has to mind
                        rules anymore, but that's just not
                        true.

              Brad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing
              the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm sorry if I broke the rules.

                                  BRAD
                        You got no business up in those
                        woods anyway, especially in the
                        rain. What if you fall and bust a
                        hip, huh? Who you think's gonna
                        have to hoss your sorry old bacon
                        back down here? Me, that's who.

                                  PAUL
                        You're hurting me!

                                  BRAD
                        What do you do up there, anyway?
                        You're too old to go jerk off, so
                        what do you do?

                                  PAUL
                        Nothing. I just walk, that's all,
                        I like to walk!

              Brad lashes out and grabs Paul's other hand, which he's been
              holding tightly clenched shut.

                                  BRAD
                        Come on. Open up. Let Poppa see.

              Paul uncurls his fingers, revealing the crushed remnants of
              a bit of toast, his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear.

                                  ELAINE (O.S.)
                        Paul?

              They turn. Elaine stands just inside the screen door with a
              cup of tea. Brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much
              she's seen. Elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing:

                                  ELAINE
                        I saw you coming back, thought
                        you'd like some tea.
                               (beat)
                        Are you coming in?

                                  PAUL
                        Mr. Dolan and I were...chatting.
                        About the weather. I think we're
                        through now.

              Brad lets Paul loose, leans close:

                                  BRAD
                        Paulie? You tell anyone I squeezed
                        your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em
                        you're having senile delusions.
                        Who you think they'll believe?

              Brad walks off. Paul turns, watches him go. The screen door
              opens and Elaine steps out, her face pale. Paul gives her a
              strained, though grateful, smile as we

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. TV ROOM - DAY

              Jerry Springer's on the tube, whipping his studio audience
              into a frenzy. PAN OFF TO REVEAL DOZENS OF OLD FOLKS watching
              on couches and folding chairs. An old black fellow named PETE
              is grousing to a GROUP OF ELDERLY LADIES...

                                  PETE
                        Why we always watch this crap?

                                  ELDERLY LADY #1
                        It's interesting.

                                  PETE
                        Interesting? Bunch'a inbred
                        trailer trash, all they ever talk
                        about is fucking...

              ...and WE CONTINUE PANNING to Paul and Elaine sitting near
              the back, talking quietly as Paul rubs his bruised hand:

                                  ELAINE
                        We should report him.

                                  PAUL
                        That might just provoke him all
                        the more, make things worse for
                        everybody.

                                  ELAINE
                        It's not everybody he has it in
                        for, Paul. It's you.
                               (off his look)
                        What did you do to provoke him in
                        the first place? Nothing. He's
                        just an abusive bully, and should
                        be made to stop.

                                  PAUL
                        Ellie, please...

              Pete

              is at the TV, switching channels while:

                                  ELDERLY LADIES
                        ...no, the Movie Classic channel
                        is further down...past the Home
                        Shopping...keep going...

              He finds the Movie Classic channel, which is playing an old
              black and white musical--"Top Hat," with Fred Astaire and
              Ginger Rogers. A delighted reaction:

                                  ELDERLY LADY #2
                        Oh! This is wonderful...

              Paul

              idly shifts his gaze to the TV...and his expression goes
              slack with recognition and dismay. Elaine sees the look in
              his eyes.

              He glances away...even briefly considers walking out...but in
              the end, he can't help himself. The past just caught up with
              him with a freight-train wallop, and, for one, he decides to
              ride the rails...

              He looks back at the TV. On screen, Fred and Ginger have
              begun their famous "Cheek to Cheek" number, with Astaire
              singing in that sublime, easy-go-lucky way of his:

                                  FRED ASTAIRE
                        Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my
                        heart beat so that I can hardly
                        speak...

              SLOW PUSH IN on Paul, watching. He'd like to take his eyes
              off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than
              Brad Dolan's. Elaine is watching him with puzzled concern:

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul? What is it?

              No response. All he can hear is that music, all he can see
              are those dancers. The figures on TV are gliding with
              ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor-dot world of long
              ago...

              Paul abruptly bursts into tears.

              The room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill. All
              eyes turn, some concerned, others merely curious. Paul just
              sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving.

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul...my God...

                                  ORDERLY
                               (rushing over)
                        What is it? What's wrong?

                                  PAUL
                        It's okay...I'll be okay...

              Another orderly appears--Brad Dolan. He puts his hand on
              Paul's shoulder and leans close, feigning concern.

                                  BRAD
                        S'matter, Paulie? Why the boo-hoo-
                        hoo? Something nasty happen?

              Elaine shoves his hand away, eyes flashing with anger.

                                  ELAINE
                        Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly
                        fine without your help, thank you.

              Brad back off with a "hey, suit yourself" gesture. Elaine
              helps Paul to his feet and leads him out.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. SUN ROOM - DAY

              Paul is staring out the windows, pensive and drained. It's
              raining now, pattering the glass and the lawn beyond. Elaine
              waits across from him, wishing he would speak. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        I guess sometimes the past just
                        catches up with you, whether you
                        want it to or not. It's silly.

                                  ELAINE
                        Was it the film?
                               (off his look)
                        It was, wasn't it?

                                  PAUL
                        I haven't spoken of these things
                        in a long time, Ellie. Over sixty
                        years.

              She reaches out, gently takes his hand.

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul. I'm your friend.

                                  PAUL
                        Yes. Yes you are.

              Paul wonders if he's even up to talking about it after all
              this time...and decides that perhaps he is:

                                  PAUL
                        I ever tell you I was a prison
                        guard during the depression?

                                  ELAINE
                        You've mentioned it.

                                  PAUL
                        Did I mention I was in charge of
                        death row? That I supervised all
                        the executions?

              This does come as a surprise. She shakes her head.

                                  PAUL
                        They usually call death row the
                        Last Mile, but we called ours the
                        Green Mile, because the floor was
                        the color of faded limes. We had
                        the electric chair then. Old
                        Sparky, we called it.
                               (beat)
                        I've lived a lot of years, Ellie,
                        but 1935 takes the prize. That was
                        the year I had the worst urinary
                        infection of my life. That was
                        also the year of John Coffey, and
                        the two dead girls...

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (1935)

              HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS work the fields, pickaxes rising and
              falling in waves, a prison song being sung in cadence with
              the work. GUARDS patrol on horseback, rifles aimed at the sky.

              A late 20's Ford PRISON TRUCK comes chugging into view along
              the road, kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat. It
              seems to be riding unusually low on its rear suspension.

              EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN PENITENTIARY - ESTABLISHING - DAY

              A Depression-era prison in the south. The prison truck sways
              down the rutted dirt road toward the main gate...

              INT. E BLOCK TOILET - DAY

              ...while Paul Edgecomb, early 40's, stands in a cramped
              toilet in his guard's uniform, trying to piss. His face is
              pained, his forehead beaded with sweat.

              INT. E BLOCK (THE GREEN MILE) - DAY

              BRUTUS HOWELL(nicknamed "Brutal" for his intimidating size,
              but he's actually rather thoughtful by nature) stands at the
              entry door of the cellblock, peering out through a viewing
              slot. He sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate.

              He turns and nods to fellow guard DEAN STANTON sitting at the
              duty desk, then cross the Green Mile--a wide corridor of
              faded green linoleum running some sixty paces top to bottom,
              with four large cells to a side.

              Brutal steps to the bathroom, listen a moment, knocks softly.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Paul? Prisoner.

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                        Christ. Gimme a minute.

              Brutal waits patiently, a bit embarrassed. He finally hears
              a THIN TRICKLE, accompanied by a stifled groan of pain.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You all right in there?

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                        For a man pissing razor blades.

              The door opens, revealing Paul's pale and sweaty face.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You should'a took the day off,
                        gone to see the doctor.

                                  PAUL
                        With a new arrival? You know
                        better. Besides, it's not as bad
                        as it was. I think it's clearing
                        up.

              They hear the truck HONKING as it rumbles up outside. Paul
              gives them a nod to resume their positions. Paul walks down
              the Mile, passing the cells where two inmates reside--the
              first is ARLEN BITTERBUCK, a Washita Cherokee; the second is
              EDUARD DELACROIX("DEL"), a skinny Cajun.

                                  DEL
                        New boy coming in, boss?

                                  PAUL
                        Never you mind, Del, you just keep
                        your nose quietly on your business.

              Paul arrives at the end of the Mile, takes up a position at
              an empty cell. (Down at this end, past the cells, is E
              Block's version of the "hole" -- a padded room where violent
              inmates are sent to cool off. It isn't used very often...in
              fact, at the moment, it's doubling as storage space.)

              Brutal

              peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Damn, they're riding on the axle.
                        What'd they do, bust the springs?

              GUARDS PERCY WETMORE AND HARRY TERWILLIGER OF E BLOCK emerge
              from the back of the truck and step down, turn back...

              Tighter angle on back of truck

              We get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of
              GIGANTIC BLACK FEET step down into the yard...and the rear of
              the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs.

              Brutal

              sees what's coming, eyes widening slightly.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Paul? You might wanna reconsider
                        getting in the cell with this guy?

                                  PAUL
                        Why's that?

                                  BRUTAL
                        He's enormous.

                                  PAUL
                        Can't be bigger than you.

              Brutal tosses him a look--just wait. He swings the door open
              in a hot flood of daylight, giving us our first good look at:

              John coffey

              is a huge black man, nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his
              massive head shiny and bald, his skin a tapestry of old
              scars, his prison overalls (the biggest size they had) ending
              at mid-calf. He looks dull and confused, as if wondering
              where he is and how he got there. Percy and Harry lead him
              toward E Block in shackles. Percy's got his hickory baton out
              of it custom-made holster, hollering:

                                  PERCY
                        Dead man walking! Dead man walking
                        here!

              Inside the cellblock

              Paul can't see them approach from where he stands, but he can
              certainly hear Percy:

                                  PAUL
                        Jeezus, pleeze-us, what the hell's
                        he yelling about?

              Up by the door, Brutal just rolls his eyes. Percy is the
              first one through the door, still hollering...

                                  PERCY
                        Dead man walking!

              ...then Coffey enters, ducking low to get through, his shadow
              blotting out Brutal and Dean as his massive frame fills the
              door. Everything hangs suspended for a moment, a look of
              "hold shit" written on everybody's faces. Percy keeps yanking
              on the big man's cuffs, leading him along with a cry of:

                                  PERCY
                        Dead man walking! Dead man--

                                  PAUL
                        Percy, that's enough.

              Percy falls reproachfully silent. Paul doesn't dignify it,
              just motions for them to come on. The procession comes down
              the Mile, with Brutal and Dean bringing up rear.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You sure you wanna be in there
                        with him?

                                  PAUL
                               (looks to Coffey)
                        Am I gonna have trouble with you,
                        big boy?

              Coffey shakes his head slowly. Paul takes the clipboard
              transfer papers from Harry, turns and enters the cell.

              Coffey just stands outside the cell and waits, as if he
              doesn't understand the concept. Paul motions him to come on
              in. Coffey starts to comply, but Percy raps him smartly with
              the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster.

              Coffey flinches, enters the cell. Paul stares angrily at
              Percy, who stands slapping his hickory baton against the palm
              of his hand like a man with a toy he's itching to use.

                                  PAUL
                        Percy. They're moving house over
                        in the infirmary. Why don't you go
                        see if they could use some help?

                                  PERCY
                        They got all the men they need.

                                  PAUL
                        Why don't you just go make sure?
                               (off his look)
                        I don't care where you go, Percy,
                        as long as it's not here at this
                        very moment.

              Percy flushes red, the baton hovering near his palm. He looks
              like he's about to say something, but thinks better of it and
              stalks angrily up the Mile instead...

              ...and sees Del at his bars, smiling. Infuriated, Percy
              swings his baton and smashes Del's fingers with a LOUD CRACK.
              Del jerks back, howling in pain:

                                  DEL
                        OWW, GOD, HE BUS' MY FINGERS!

                                  PERCY
                        Wiped that grin off your shitpoke
                        face, didn't I

                                  PAUL
                        Goddamn it, Percy! Get the hell
                        off my block!

              Percy throws Paul a look of disdain--your block, huh? He
              swaggers out. Del's on his knees, weeping from the pain:

                                  DEL
                        Oww, damn, boss, he done bus' my
                        fingers for true...

                                  PAUL
                        We'll get it looked at, Del, now
                        keep yourself quiet like I said!

              Del falls silent, moaning over his hand. Paul turns to
              Coffey, who looks unsettled by all the commotion.

                                  PAUL
                        If I let Harry take those chains
                        off you, you gonna be nice?

              Coffey nods. Harry enters to remove Coffey's shackles.

                                  PAUL
                        Your name is John Coffey.

                                  COFFEY
                               (deep and quiet)
                        Yes, sir, boss, like the drink,
                        only not spelt the same.

                                  PAUL
                        So you can spell, can you?

              Coffey shakes his head. Harry steps out.

                                  PAUL
                        My name is Paul Edgecomb. If I'm
                        not here, you can ask for Mr.
                        Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr.
                        Stanton...those gentlemen there.
                               (beat)
                        This isn't like the rest of the
                        prison. It's a quiet place, we
                        like to keep it that way.

              Coffey considers this carefully, puzzled.

                                  COFFEY
                        It weren't me making all the
                        noise, boss.

                                  PAUL
                               (eyes narrowing)
                        You having a joke on me, John
                        Coffey?

                                  COFFEY
                        No, sir.

              Paul sees he isn't joking, continues:

                                  PAUL
                        Your time here can be easy or
                        hard, depends on you. If you
                        behave, you get to walk in the
                        exercise yard every day.

                        We might even play some music on
                        the radio from time to time.
                        Questions?

              Coffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask:

                                  COFFEY
                        Do you leave a light on after
                        bedtime?

              Paul blinks. It's the last thing he expected. Coffey smiles
              uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking.

                                  COFFEY
                        Because I get a little scared in
                        the dark sometimes. If it's a
                        strange place.

              Paul looks to his men. The guards are trading glances.

                                  PAUL
                        It's pretty bright in here all
                        night long. We keep half the
                        lights burning in the corridor.

                                  COFFEY
                        Cor'der.

              Coffey looks confused. Paul points to the lights lining the
              ceiling of the Green Mile in wire mesh cages.

                                  PAUL
                        Right out there.

              Coffey nods, relieved. Then he surprises everybody by
              offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. Paul
              hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by
              accepting. Coffey's hand swallows his. Coffey shakes gently,
              lets go.

              Paul steps from the cell. Brutal slides the door shut, locks
              it. Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then
              sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees.
              He looks up at Paul, his voice soft as a whisper:

                                  COFFEY
                        Couldn't help it, boss. I tried to
                        take it back, but it was too late.

              Paul turns, leads his men up the Mile...

              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE

              ...and they enter a few moments later. Paul is furious, but
              keeping a lid on his temper:

                                  PAUL
                        Dean, run Delacroix up to the
                        infirmary and see if his fingers
                        are broken.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Course they're broken, I heard the
                        damn bones crack. Goddamn Percy.

                                  HARRY
                        You hear what he was yelling when
                        we brought the big dummy in?

                                  PAUL
                        How could I miss it, Harry? The
                        whole prison heard.

              This makes Brutal snort, breaking the tension--the others
              can't help smiling.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You'll probably have to answer for
                        sending him off the Mile. He's
                        gonna cause you trouble over this,
                        you mark me.

                                  PAUL
                        I'll chew that food when I have
                        to. Right now I wanna hear about
                        the new inmate...aside from how
                        big he is, okay?

                                  BRUTAL
                               (smiles)
                        Monstrous big. Damn.

                                  PAUL
                        Seems meek enough. Looks like they
                        sent us an imbecile to execute.

                                  HARRY
                        Imbecile or not, he deserves to
                        fry for what he done. Here...

              Harry tosses a pair of manila envelopes bound with rubber
              bands on the desk before Paul--Coffey's file.

                                  HARRY
                        ...make your blood curdle.

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. E BLOCK PRISON YARD - DAY

              A small are reserved for inmates of the Mile, fenced-off from
              the main prison yard. Arlen Bitterbuck walks the perimeter
              under the watchful eyes of guard BILL DODGE.

              We find Paul sitting by himself on the bleachers with
              Coffey's file on his knees, thoughtfully unwrapping his brown-
              bagged sandwich. PUSH SLOWLY IN as he begins to read...

              EXT. DETTERICK FARM - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

              ...and we see Klaus Detterick walk from his house to the barn
              with a milking pail, a solitary figure against a brightening
              horizon. He disappears into the barn...

              ...and we hold for a long moment, the house silent
              b.g.,chickens clucking and scratching in the front yard...

              ...until a WOMAN'S SCREAM shatters the silence. Klaus
              reappears, dropping the pail, running toward the house...

              INT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

              ...and Klaus bursts in to find his wife MARJORIE absolutely
              frantic with terror:

                                  KLAUS
                        WHAT? GOD SAKES, WHAT?

                                  MARJORIE
                        THE GIRLS! THE GIRLS ARE GONE!

              She drags him through the house to a screened-off porch area
              where their 12 year old son HOWIE is pointing and shouting--

                                  HOWIE
                        Papa! Papa, look! The blood!

              --and Klaus freezes there, stunned to see blood spattered on
              the floor and the screen door hanging off its hinges...

                                  KLAUS
                        Oh my God.

              really tasting it, keeps reading...

              INT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

              ...plunging us back into the screaming chaos: Klaus grabbing
              up shotgun shells, Howie loading the .22 rifle he got for
              Christmas, Marjorie sobbing incoherently...

                                  KLAUS
                        GODDAMN IT, WOMAN, GET ON THE
                        PHONE NOW! YOU TELL 'EM WE HEADED
                        WEST! MIND WHAT I'M SAYING! WEST,
                        Y'HEAR?

              ...and she goes stumbling through the house, grabbing for the
              phone as her men disappear toward the porch b.g.:

                                  MARJORIE
                        Central! Central, are you on the
                        line? Oh, God, please, somebody
                        took my little girls...

              OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

              Klaus and his son race from the house, following spatters of
              blood across the yard...

              EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

              ---and we see CARS AND TRUCKS pulling up, MEN jumping out
              with rifles, pouring down the incline toward the field where
              Klaus is hollering and waving his arms. Deputy McGee comes
              sliding down from the road, taking charge at the top of his
              lungs--

                                  McGEE
                        I WANT ALL THE WEAPONS UNLOADED,
                        Y'HEAR? TAKE OUT YOUR SHELLS, I
                        WON'T HAVE A MAN SHOT BY ACCIDENT
                        TODAY! BOBO, WHERE THEM DOGS?

              --and the dogs come bounding out of the back of a truck,
              howling down the incline to lead the chase...

              VARIOUS ANGLES

              ...which takes us through the cattails and bulrushes...to the
              spot where Klaus finds the little scrap of pale yellow
              fabric, turns and screams...

                                  KLAUS
                        Oh, Lord, this belongs to my
                        Katie...

              ...and they keep going, stopping abruptly as they find: A
              blood-drenched area of tramped grass. A little girl's bloody
              nightgown hangs in the low branches of a tree. Some of these
              strong men look like they might throw up or faint at the
              sight of it. Their blood freezes in their veins as an INHUMAN
              HOWLING commences up ahead. It's like nothing they've ever
              heard before, raising the hackles of men and dogs alike.

              PAUL ON BLEACHERS

              ...as Paul quietly turns another page, shaking his head...

                                  PAUL
                        Jesus.

              EXT. FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

              The men reload their weapons. Everybody's terrified. McGee
              starts off, the other following his lead toward--

              THE RIVER

              --where they emerge from the treeline, drawing ever closer to
              the source of that INHUMAN HOWLING...

              ...and they stop, gazing in horror:

              John Coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls, his
              huge feet splayed out before him. He's making that inhuman
              howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing
              occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air.

              Curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of
              Detterick's 9 year-old twin girls, their once-blonde hair now
              matted to their heads with blood.

              A tableau. The men staring. John Coffey howling. A train
              puffing smoke across the landscape.

              Klaus Detterick breaks the moment, lunging down the riverbank
              in a headlong rush. The others try to grab him, but he shrugs
              them off and throws himself on Coffey with a scream of
              inarticulate rage, kicking and punching, fists flying. Coffey
              barely seems to notice.

              The others catch up with Klaus, drag him off. He falls to his
              knees on the riverbank, sobbing into his hands. Howie runs to
              him, throws himself into his father's arm. They hug each
              other tightly, overwhelmed with grief.

              A semblance of quiet descends, except for Coffey's
              heartbroken wailing. A ring of rifle toting men forms around
              him, though he hardly seems aware of it. McGee steps forward,
              uncertain:

                                  McGEE
                        Mister.

              Coffey goes quiet at once, eyes still streaming tears.

                                  McGEE
                        Mister? Can you hear me?
                               (Coffey nods)
                        You have a name?

                                  COFFEY
                        John Coffey. Like the drink, only
                        not spelt the same.

              McGee hunkers carefully down, watching for any sudden moves.

                                  McGEE
                        What happened here, John Coffey?
                        You want to tell me that?

                                  COFFEY
                        I couldn't help it. I tried to
                        take it back, but it was too late.

                                  McGEE
                               (pause)
                        Boy, you are under arrest for
                        murder.

              McGee spits in Coffey's face...

              PAUL ON BLEACHERS

              ...as Paul looks up with a slight start, jarred from his
              reading to find WARDEN HAL MOORES standing before him.

                                  HAL
                        I interrupt?

                                  PAUL
                        I'm just about done.

              Paul stows the file as Hal settles onto the bleachers.

                                  PAUL
                        How's that pretty gal of yours?

                                  HAL
                        Melinda's not so well, Paul. Not
                        so well at all. Got laid up with
                        another headache yesterday. Worst
                        one yet. She's also developed this
                        weakness in her right hand.

                                  PAUL
                        Doctor still think it's migraines?

              Hal gives a slight shake of his head.

                                  HAL
                        I'll be taking her up to Indianola
                        next day or so for some tests. Had
                        X-rays and the like. She is scared
                        to death. Truth to tell, so am I.

                                  PAUL
                        If it's something they can see
                        with an X-ray, maybe it's
                        something they can fix.

                                  HAL
                        Maybe.

              He pulls a letter, hands it to Paul.

                                  HAL
                        This just came in. D.O.E. on
                        Bitterbuck.

              Paul glances toward Bitterbuck, scans the letter, nods.

                                  PAUL
                        You didn't come all the way down
                        here just to hand me a D.O.E.

                                  HAL
                        No. I had an angry call from the
                        state capital about twenty minutes
                        ago. Is it true you ordered Percy
                        Wetmore off the block.

                                  PAUL
                        It is.

                                  HAL
                        I'm sure you had reason, but like
                        it or not, the wife of the
                        governor of this state has only
                        one nephew, and his name happens
                        to be Percy Wetmore. I need to
                        tell you how this lays out?

                                  PAUL
                        Little Percy called his aunt and
                        squealed like a schoolroom sissy.
                               (Hal nods)
                        He also mention he assaulted a
                        prisoner this morning out of sheer
                        petulance? Broke three fingers on
                        Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

                                  HAL
                        I didn't hear that part. I'm sure
                        she didn't either.

                                  PAUL
                        The man is mean, careless, and
                        stupid. Bad combination in a place
                        like this. Sooner or later, he's
                        gonna get somebody hurt. Or worse.

                                  HAL
                        You and Brutus Howell will make
                        sure that doesn't happen.

                                  PAUL
                        Easy enough to say. We can't watch
                        him every minute, Hal.

                                  HAL
                        Stick with it. May not be much
                        longer. I have it on good
                        authority that Percy has an
                        application in at Briar Ridge.

                                  PAUL
                        The mental hospital?

                                  HAL
                               (nods)
                        Administration job. Better pay.

                                  PAUL
                        Then why's he still here? He could
                        get that application pushed
                        through...hell, with his
                        connections, he could have any
                        state job he wants.

              Hal has no answer. Paul look off toward Bitterbuck.

                                  PAUL
                        Tell you what I think. I think he
                        just wants to see one cook up
                        close.

              Hal follows Paul's gaze, takes his meaning.

                                  HAL
                        Well, he'll get his chance then,
                        won't he? Maybe then he'll be
                        satisfied and move on. In the
                        meantime, you'll keep the peace.

                                  PAUL
                        Of course.

                                  HAL
                        Thank you, Paul.

              Hal rises, slapping yard dust off his trousers.

                                  PAUL
                        You give Melinda my love, okay? I
                        bet that X-ray turns out to be
                        nothing at all.

              Hal walks off looking like he's got the weight of the world
              on his shoulders. Paul looks at the letter again...

              TIGHT ON LETTER

              ...which is head: Date Of Execution."

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

              Paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours of the morning,
              drinking buttermilk and listening to SOFT MUSIC on the radio.
              JANICE EDGECOMB appears, shuffling sleepily downstairs.

                                  JAN
                        Paul?

                                  PAUL
                        Hey, you. Music too loud?

                                  JAN
                        No. There's just this big empty
                        spot in the bed where my husband
                        usually sleeps.

                                  PAUL
                        He said to tell you he's having a
                        little trouble with that tonight.

              She comes into the kitchen, strokes his hair. There's an easy
              familiarity and a deep love between these two.

                                  JAN
                        Worried about Melinda and Hal? Is
                        that what's got you up?

                                  PAUL
                        Yeah, that. Things.

                                  JAN
                        Things.

              She sits on his lap and gives him a crooked smile--you're not
              getting off that easily.

                                  PAUL
                        Got a new inmate today. Big,
                        simple-minded fella.

                                  JAN
                        Do I want to hear what he did?

                                  PAUL
                        No. One sleepless member of this
                        family's enough.
                               (softly)
                        The things that happen in this
                        world. It's a wonder God allows it.

              She gives him a tiny kiss above his left eyebrow, in that
              special spot that makes him prickle.

                                  JAN
                        Why don't you come to bed? I've
                        got something to help you sleep,
                        and you can have all you want.

                                  PAUL
                        Don't I wish. I've still got
                        something wrong with my
                        waterworks, I don't want to pass
                        it on.

                                  JAN
                        You see Doc Sadler yet?

                                  PAUL
                        No, because he'll want me to take
                        sulfa tablets and I'll spend the
                        rest of the week puking in every
                        corner of my office. It'll run its
                        course all by itself, thank you
                        very much for your concern.

              She kisses that spot above his eyebrow again. He smiles.

                                  JAN
                        Poor old guy...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              IN TIGHT ANGLES: Copper plugs are cleaned, switches are
              oiled, circuits are tested...

              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

              ...as maintenance is performed on Old Sparky by JACK VAN HAY
              and a small crew. Paul is carefully sanding a connector plug.
              Dean is waxing Old Sparky's wooden arms to a gleam.

              Paul and Dean pause, thinking they hear a LAUGH drifting in
              from E Block...and then Brutal calls softly to them:

                                  BRUTAL (O.S.)
                        Paul? Dean?

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Paul and Dean enter to find Brutal trying not to wake the
              cons in their cells by laughing too loudly. They follows his
              gaze down the Mile, see nothing, turn to him like he's crazy.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I guess the legislature loosened
                        those purse-strings enough to hire
                        on a new guard.
                               (off their looks)
                        Look again. He's right there.

              Paul and Dean look again and this time they see it:

              A tiny brown mouse is coming up the Mile. It trots a short
              distance, peers right and left as if checking the snoring
              inmates in their cells, then makes another forward spurt.

                                  PAUL
                        He's doing a cell check.

              This gets them all trying not to laugh. The mouse draws ever
              closer. Dean starts to look worried.

                                  DEAN
                        It ain't normal for a mouse to
                        come up on people that way. Maybe
                        it's rabid.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Oh, my Christ. The big mouse
                        expert. The Mouse Man. You see it
                        foaming at the mouth, Mouse Man?

                                  DEAN
                               (dubious)
                        I don't see its mouth at all.

              That does it--Paul and Brutal burst out laughing. The mouse
              stops before them and peers up, curling its tail primly
              around its paws as if to wait. The guards fall silent,
              fascinated. Bitterbuck stirs in his cell, sits up to watch.

              Brutal tears off a piece of his half-eaten corned beef
              sandwich, holds it delicately out with two fingers. The mouse
              rises up, appraising the morsel with shiny black eyes.

                                  DEAN
                        Aw, Brutal, no! We'll be hip-deep
                        in mice around here...

                                  BRUTAL
                               (to Paul)
                        I just wanna see what he'll do. In
                        the interests of science, like.

              Paul shrugs. Brutal drops the scrap. The mouse grabs it and
              eats, sitting up like a dog doing a trick.

              The mouse turns and scurries back down the Mile, vanishing
              under the restraint room door at the far end. Dean throws
              Paul an "I told you so" look.

                                  DEAN
                        He's in the damn restraint room.
                        You know he's gonna be chewing the
                        padding out of walls and making
                        himself a nice little nest.

              Brutal give Paul a sheepish look--well? Paul sighs.

                                  PAUL
                        All right. Let's get the damn
                        mouse.

              They stride grimly down the Mile to the restraint room door,
              men on a mission. Coffey's awake now, peering from his cot.

                                  COFFEY
                        Saw me a mouse go by.

                                  PAUL
                        It was a dream. Go back to sleep.

                                  COFFEY
                        Weren't no dream. It was a mouse
                        all right.

                                  PAUL
                        Can't put anything over on you.

              Paul unlocks the door, revealing a padded room filled with
              storage: cleaning supplies, buckets of paint, mops and
              ladders, you name it. Brutal shrugs off his jacket. Paul
              grabs a mop from a steel bucket, hands it to Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        Dean, watch the door. He tries to
                        get past you, whack him.

                                  DEAN
                        Brutal or the mouse?

                                  BRUTAL
                        Har har, Mouse Man.

              Brutal and Paul start doing the heavy lifting, muscling an
              unused filing cabinet out the door...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and they finally relay the last few heavy buckets of paint
              onto the Mile. Paul and Brutal catch their breath, scanning
              the empty restraint room. Their eyes go glaringly to Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        You let him get past you.

                                  DEAN
                        No I didn't, I was here all the
                        time!

                                  BRUTAL
                        Then where the hell is he?

              They move slowly into the room, peering into every nook and
              cranny, utterly mystified. Brutal shakes his head.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Three grown men. Outsmarted by a
                        mouse.

                                  DEAN
                        Well, bright side is, all this
                        commotion probably scared him off
                        for good.

                                  PAUL
                        Yeah, that's right. That's the
                        last we'll see of him...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                                "The Mouse on the Mile"

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              A low, static shot. Green floor stretching before us. Harry
              and Bill Dodge are at the desk b.g., doing paperwork and
              filing chores. Percy is idling nearby, whistling softly and
              combing his hair...

              ...and into this quiet shot, deep in foreground, creeps the
              mouse. He starts walking the Mile as before...

              ...right toward Percy.

              COFFEY

              stares through his bars as the mouse goes by...

              PERCY

              keeps combing his hair, unaware...

              DEL

              sits quietly picking his nose in his cell. The mouse appears
              outside the bars, cruising inexorably up the Mile. Del turns
              slowly, watches the mouse go by...

              PERCY

              still grooming himself, still unaware...

              THE MOUSE

              keeps coming closer. ANGLE UP to Bitterbuck peering through
              his bars, watching him go by...

              PERCY

              keeps working that comb--and freezes at the sound of a TINY
              SQUEAK. His head swivels slowly...

              ...and there's the mouse. Staring at him.

              That moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than time
              itself. If mice have a natural enemy, Percy is it.

                                  PAUL
                        You little son of a bitch.

              Harry and Bill glance up from their work.

                                  HARRY
                        Well, I'll be damned. There he is,
                        big as Billy-be-frigged. I thought
                        Brutal was pulling my leg.

                                  BILL
                        That's a goddamn mouse.

                                  HARRY
                        Yeah. Brute said he was in here
                        last night begging for food, came
                        right up to the desk.

                                  BILL
                        My ass. Give him some room, Percy,
                        see what he does.

              Percy takes a few careful steps back, eyes never leaving the
              mouse. (Percy's hand starts easing toward the handle of his
              baton.) The mouse comes up to the desk as before.

                                  HARRY
                        Brave little bastard, gotta give
                        him that.

              Harry breaks off a small piece of cracker and drops it. The
              mouse picks it up, starts to eat. (Percy's hand inches ever
              closer to his baton).

                                  BILL
                        Here, lemme try.

              Bill drops a piece of cracker. The mouse ignores it
              completely, keeping its beady little eyes on Harry. (Percy's
              hand starts easing his baton from its holster.)

                                  BILL
                        Maybe he's full.

                                  HARRY
                               (grins)
                        Maybe he knows you're just a
                        floater. Gotta be an E Block
                        regular to feed the E Block mouse,
                        don'cha know...

              Harry drops another piece--and sure enough, the mouse starts
              to eat. Harry's smile fades. He and Bill trade a look.

                                  HARRY
                        I was just kidding ab--

              Percy lets rip a BELLOWING WAR CRY ("Yaaaahhh!") and launches
              his baton like a spear, scaring the crap out of everyone.

              The mouse ducks (yes, actually ducks) and the baton sail over
              his head close enough to ruffle its fur, bouncing off the
              floor. Apparently remembering a pressing engagement
              elsewhere, the mouse takes off in a flash toward the
              restraint room.

              Percy roars with frustration and takes off after it, trying
              to squash it with his heavy work shoes, leaping and stomping
              with great big galloping strides, missing the mouse by
              inches...

              ...and thus is the Green Mile traversed, with Percy stomping
              and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer, the convicts
              yelling at their bars, the mouse zigging and zagging like Jim
              Thorpe heading for the endzone...

              The mouse wins, zipping to safety under the restraint room
              door. Percy pounds his fist against the door in frustration:

                                  PERCY
                        FUCK!

              He fumbles with his keys, unlocks the door, yelling all the
              while:

                                  PERCY
                        I'M GONNA RIP YOUR DISEASED HEAD
                        OFF, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT!

              OUTSIDE E BLOCK

              Paul and Brutal are arriving for work--they pause, hearing
              PERCY'S YELLS drifting from the windows. The regular CONS in
              the yard are drifting curiously to the fence, wondering if a
              riot's brewing. Paul and Brutal take off running--

              INSIDE E BLOCK

              --and rush in to find:

                                  HARRY
                        Percy met your mouse.

              Harry points. Percy's down at the far end, rummaging wildly
              in the restraint room, tossing shit out onto the Mile.

                                  PERCY
                        It's in here somewhere! I'm gonna
                        squish the little son of a bitch!

              He starts muscling the filing cabinet out the door, kicking
              buckets out of his way. Brutal calls out to him:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Percy, we already tried that--

                                  PERCY
                        What? Whad'ja say?

                                  BRUTAL
                        I said--

              Paul stops Brutal with a look--don't you dare stop him.

                                  BRUTAL
                        --uh, knock yourself out. Hope you
                        nail the bastard.

              Paul crosses his arms and smiles, leans back against the desk
              to wait...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and Percy hauls the last of the stuff out, exhausted. He
              steps back in and looks around, unable to believe there's no
              mouse cowering in the corner. Paul and the men approach,
              keeping straight faces, navigating the crap in the corridor.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Gosh. Ain't in there, huh? Don't
                        that beat the mousie band?

              Percy keeps scanning the restraint room. The others all look
              to Paul, waiting for him to speak--you're the boss.

                                  PAUL
                        Percy. You want to think about
                        what you were doing just now.

                                  PERCY
                               (turns, glaring)
                        I know what I was doing. Trying to
                        get the mouse. You blind?

                                  HARRY
                        You also scared the living crap
                        out of me and Bill. And them.

              He cocks a thumb at the inmates in their cells.

                                  PERCY
                        So what? They aren't in cradle-
                        school, case you didn't notice...

                               (directed at Paul)
                        ...although you treat them that
                        way half the time.

                                  BRUTAL
                        We don't scare 'em any more than
                        we have to, Percy. They're under
                        enough strain as it is.

                                  PAUL
                        Men under strain can snap. Hurt
                        themselves. Hurt others. That's
                        why our job is talking, not
                        yelling. You'll do better to think
                        of this place like an intensive
                        care ward in a hospital--

                                  PERCY
                        I think of it as a bucket of piss
                        to drown rats in. That's all.
                               (scans their faces)
                        Anybody doesn't like it can kiss
                        my ass. How's that sit?

              Brutal steps forward, wanting to slug the little bastard.
              Percy shies back, but keeps his bravado up:

                                  PERCY
                        Try it. You'll be on the bread
                        lines before the week is out.

                                  PAUL
                        We all know who your connections
                        are, Percy...
                               (steps close)
                        ...but you ever threaten a man on
                        this block again, we're all gonna
                        have a go. Job be damned.

                                  PERCY
                        Big talk. You done?

                                  PAUL
                        Get all this shit back in the
                        restraint room. You're cluttering
                        up my Mile.

              They turn and walk away, leaving Percy as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              A SLOW TRACKING SHOT OF THE GREEN FLOOR takes us past a tiny
              scrap of break...and then another...and then past a mousetrap
              primed with a scrap of bacon...

              ...and we keep following a long trail of bread scraps and
              mousetraps until we come to Percy, alone on the Mile,
              carefully laying the last mousetrap down...

              ...and he scoots back against the desk to wait, crouched and
              holding his breath, eyes riveted to the restraint room door
              for any sign of his furry nemesis...

              ...and CAMERA BOOMS SLOWLY DOWN off his face, dipping down to
              floor level...

              ...where the mouse is revealed under the desk, peering in the
              same direction as Percy, wondering what the hell's so
              interesting down there. It hops further out to see...

              ANGLE OF PERCY FROM FLOOR LEVEL

              ...and the mouse enters frame, hopping out a few more steps,
              mouse and man staring in the same direction.

              A long beat. Percy turns, looks down at the mouse. The mouse
              turns, looks up at Percy...

              ...and all hell breaks loose again. They race the Mile as
              before, Percy hollering and stomping all the way, mousetraps
              snapping and flying up into frame as they go charging wildly
              past the cells.

              The mouse wins again. Percy pauses, furious...and sees Coffey
              staring at him from his cell.

                                  COFFEY
                        Saw me a mouse go by.

              Percy loses it, kicking and punching the restraint room door
              in a screaming rage as we

                                                       FADE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Paul appears at Bitterbuck's bars with a group of guards.

                                  PAUL
                        Arlen? Your daughter and her
                        family are here.

              Bitterbuck steps from his cell. Bill Dodge escorts him off
              the block. The moment they're gone:

                                  PAUL
                        Let's move. I want at least two
                        rehearsals before he gets back.

              INT. VISITOR'S ROOM - DAY

              Bitterbuck is led in. His DAUGHTER rises...an awkward
              hesitation...and she touches his face, kisses him. He takes
              her hands, kisses them, tries not to cry. The rest of the
              family is there: SON-IN-LAW, GRANDCHILDREN, COUSINS. They
              form around him, murmuring hellos, shaking hands...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              ...while TOOT-TOOT takes Bitterbuck's place in the cell. He's
              a wiry and toothless old trusty, crazy as a tick. He sits:

                                  TOOT
                        Sittin' down, sittin' down,
                        rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

              He glances to Paul--okay, hit it.

                                  PAUL
                        Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

              Toot springs to his feet and steps from the cell.

                                  TOOT
                        I'm steppin' forward, I'm steppin'
                        forward, I'm steppin' forward...

              Toot turns, shows the top of his head to Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        Is his head properly shaved?

                                  DEAN
                        No, it's dandruffy and it smells.

                                  PAUL
                        I'll take that for a yes. All
                        right, Arlen, let's go.

              Toot starts up the corridor, ringed by guards.

                                  TOOT
                        I'm walkin' the Mile, I'm walkin'
                        the Mile, I'm walkin' the Mile...

              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE

              Toot throws himself to his knees as soon as they enter:

                                  TOOT
                        I'm prayin', I'm prayin', I'm
                        prayin'. The Lord is my shepherd,
                        so on an' so forth...

                                  PAUL
                        Toot, you have to wait till I tell
                        you to pray.
                               (Toot waits)
                        Okay, pray.

                                  TOOT
                        Still prayin', still prayin'...

                                  HARRY
                        Paul, we're not gonna have some
                        Cherokee medicine man in here
                        whoopin' and hollerin' and shaking
                        his dick, are we?

                                  PAUL
                        Well, actually--

                                  TOOT
                        Still prayin', prayin', gettin'
                        right with Jesus...

                                  HARRY
                        Do it quietly, you old gink!

              Harry slaps Toot upside the head to shut him up.

                                  PAUL
                        As I was saying, I don't believe
                        they actually shake their dicks,
                        Harry. Be that as it may, Mr.
                        Bitterbuck is a Christian, so we
                        got Reverend Schuster coming in.

                                  DEAN
                        Oh, he's good. Fast, too. Doesn't
                        get 'em worked up.

                                  PAUL
                        On your feet, Toot. You've prayed
                        enough for one day.

                                  TOOT
                        Gettin' to my feet, walkin' again,
                        walkin' on the Green Mile...

              EXECUTION CHAMBER

              They enter. Brutal is waiting for them, gun drawn. Percy
              peers out from behind the partition wall from the switch room.

                                  PERCY
                        What do I do?

                                  PAUL
                        Watch and learn.

              Paul motions Percy behind the wall. Percy sighs, takes his
              spot next to Jack Van Hay, peers through the wire mesh as
              Toot plops into Old Sparky, wriggling his skinny ass to get
              comfy.

                                  TOOT
                        Sittin' down, sittin' down, takin'
                        a seat in Old Sparky's lap...

              Paul and Dean kneel to apply the ankle clamps. Brutal steps
              in from the side, pressing down on the condemned man's left
              arm to keep him in place until the ankle clamps are secure.
              Harry moves in from the other side, securing the right arm
              clamp.

                                  TOOT
                        Gettin' clamped, gettin' clamped,
                        gettin'--ow, shit, watch the skin!

              Paul signals "ankles secure." Brutal holsters his pistol,
              applies the final clamp to the left arm.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Roll on one.

              BEHIND THE PARTITION

              Van Hay mimes turning the generator knob up, whispering:

                                  VAN HAY
                        "Roll on one" means I turn the
                        generator up full. You'll see the
                        lights go brighter in half the
                        prison...

              RESUME MAIN CHAMBER

              as Brutal steps before the "condemned" and pronounces:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been
                        condemned to die by a jury of your
                        peers, sentence imposed by a judge
                        in good standing in this state.

                        Do you have anything to say before
                        the sentence is carried out?

                                  TOOT
                               (gleefully)
                        Yeah! I want a fried chicken
                        dinner with gravy on the taters,
                        I want to shit in your hat, and I
                        got to have Mae West sit on my
                        face, because I am one horny
                        motherfucker!

              Brutal tries to hold on, but it's impossible--he cracks up.
              Everybody falls apart, howling helplessly with laughter. Even
              Jack Van Hay is guffawing behind his partition.

              Only Paul is reining it in--he's a little too pissed to go
              with it. He waits until the laughing fit starts to pass, then:

                                  PAUL
                        Shut up, Brutal. That goes for
                        everybody. I want quiet in here.
                               (turns)
                        Toot, another remark like that,
                        I'll have Van Hay roll on two for
                        real.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (beat, gently)
                        It was pretty funny.

                                  PAUL
                        That's why I don't like it.
                        Tomorrow night we're doing this
                        for real. I don't want somebody
                        remembering a stupid joke like
                        that and getting going again.
                               (off their looks)
                        Ever try not laughing in church
                        once something funny gets stuck in
                        your head. Same goddamn thing.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Sorry, Paul. You're right. Let's
                        keep going. Harry...

              Harry takes a black mask and snugs it down over Toot's head,
              leaving only the crown of his head exposed. Brutal takes a
              large sponge, dips it in a steel bucket, mimes soaking it...

              BEHIND THE PARTITION

                                  PERCY
                        What's with the sponge?

                                  VAN HAY
                        You soak it in brine, get it good
                        and wet. Conducts the electricity
                        directly to the brain, fast like
                        a bullet. You don't ever want to
                        throw the switch on a man without
                        that.

              RESUME MAIN CHAMBER

              as the sponge is placed atop Toot's head. Harry now lowers
              the steel cap and Brutal secures the straps.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity
                        shall now be passed through your
                        body until you are dead, in
                        accordance with the state law. God
                        have mercy on your soul.
                               (to Van Hay)
                        Roll on two.

              BEHIND THE PARTITION

              Van Hay mimes flipping the switch, looks to Percy:

                                  VAN HAY
                        And that's that.

              RESUME MAIN CHAMBER

              Toot can't resist--he starts bucking and flailing:

                                  TOOT
                        Now I'm fryin'! Fryin'! Geeaaah!
                        Fryin' like a done tom turkey!

              Paul rolls his eyes at Brutal. Brutal shifts his gaze past
              him and nods--look behind you.

                                  BRUTAL
                        One of the witnesses showed up a
                        day early.

              Paul turns. Sitting on the door sill, watching them with
              beady eyes, is the mouse. Paul turns back, addresses the room:

                                  PAUL
                        All right, let's go again and do
                        it right this time! Get that idiot
                        out of the chair...

              HIGH WIDE ANGLE OF EXECUTION CHAMBER

              Brutal and Harry start undoing Toot's clamps. Everybody
              relaxes, drifting from their positions...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              SAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - NEXT NIGHT

              ...and the room is now quietly filling up with WITNESSES
              trickling in. People speak in whispers, if at all.

              INT. BITTERBUCK'S CELL - NIGHT

              Bitterbuck, the top of his head now shaved, is speaking
              quietly as Paul listens:

                                  BITTERBUCK
                        You think if a man sincerely
                        repents on what he done wrong, he
                        might get to go back to the time
                        that was happiest for him and live
                        there forever? Could that be what
                        heaven is like?

              Paul doesn't think so--but that's not what Bitterbuck needs
              to hear, so the lie comes easy:

                                  PAUL
                        I just about believe that very
                        thing.

              Pause. Bitterbuck smiles.

                                  BITTERBUCK
                        Had me a young wife when I was
                        eighteen. Spent our first summer
                        in the mountains. Made love every
                        night. She'd just lie there after,
                        bare-breasted in the firelight,
                        and we'd talk sometimes till the
                        sun come up.
                               (beat)
                        That was my best time.

              Brutal appears at the door, checks his pocketwatch, nods to
              Paul. Bitterbuck takes a deep breath, getting himself ready.

                                  PAUL
                        It'll be fine. You'll do fine.

              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

              THE SPONGE is pulled sopping wet from the bucket of brine,
              dripping a trail of water across the floor. Brutal places it
              atop Bitterbuck's head. Water courses down the sides of the
              condemned man's mask and neck, pooling on the floor.

              The cap is lowered, the straps secured. All we hear now is
              the sound of Bitterbuck's BREATHING growing louder and faster
              under the mask...until, softly:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Roll on two.

              WHAM! The switch is thrown. Bitterbuck surges forward against
              the straps, riding the powerful current.

              Some witnesses turn away. Paul and Brutal maintain grim eye
              contact with each other, waiting.

              Behind the partition, Percy watches through the mesh with
              gleaming eyes, wishing he could see better.

              Van Hay kills the current. Bitterbuck goes limp. A DOCTOR
              steps forward, checks for a heartbeat, shakes his head.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Again.

              The switch is thrown a second time. Bitterbuck surges forward
              again, riding the current all the way...

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              Bitterbuck's dead face stares up at us from a gurney. A hand
              reaches down, gives his cheek a squeeze. TILT UP to:

                                  PERCY
                        Adios, Chief. Drop us a card from
                        hell, let us know if it's hot
                        enough.

              Brutal knocks Percy's hand away, shoves him aside.

                                  BRUTAL
                        He's paid what he's owed. He's
                        square with the house again, so
                        keep your goddamn hands off him.

              He draws the sheet over Bitterbuck's face, wheels the gurney
              down the tunnel. Percy throws a look to Paul.

                                  PERCY
                        What's up his ass?

                                  PAUL
                        You, Percy. Always you.

              Paul brushes past him, but:

                                  PERCY
                        You gotta hate the new boy? That
                        the way it is around here?

                                  PAUL
                               (turns back)
                        Why not just move on? Go to Briar
                        Ridge.
                               (off his look)
                        Yeah, I know about it. Sounds like
                        a good job.

                                  PERCY
                        I might take it, too. Soon as you
                        put me out front.

              Paul cocks his head--excuse me?

                                  PERCY
                        You heard me. I want Brutal's spot
                        for the next execution.

                                  PAUL
                               (beat)
                        What's with you? Seeing a man die
                        isn't enough? You gotta be close
                        enough to smell his nuts cook?

                                  PERCY
                        I wanna be out front, is all. Just
                        one time. Then you'll be rid of me.

                                  PAUL
                        If I say no?

                                  PERCY
                        I might just stick around for
                        good, make me a career of this.

              Paul just shakes his head in wonder and walks away.

                                                       FADE TO:

              INT. COFFEY'S CELL - DAY

              Coffey's lying on his bunk, weeping quiet tears. He stirs at
              the sound of GIGGLING. He sits up, peers curiously through
              the bars. Softly:

                                  COFFEY
                        Del?

              AT THE GUARD STATION

              Paul glances up from writing in the daily log. Silence now.
              He goes back to writing--and the GIGGLING comes again.

                                  PAUL
                        Delacroix? That you?

              No answer. Just more giggling. Paul rises, walks down the
              Mile to Delacroix's cell--and stops, staring in through the
              bars.

              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE

              Brutal and Dean are having lunch. Paul pokes his head in.

                                  PAUL
                        You are not gonna believe this.

              RESUME E BLOCK

              The men follow Paul onto the Mile. By now, Del is CACKLING
              WILDLY in his cell. Brutal shoots Paul a look--has he gone
              insane? Paul gestures "see for yourself."

              They arrive at the bars...and find the mouse sitting on Del's
              shoulder. Del looks up, giggling like a kid at Christmas.

                                  DEL
                        Look! I done tame me dat mouse!

                                  PAUL
                        We see that.

                                  DEL
                        Watch dis! Watch what he do!

              He stretches out his left arm. The mouse crawls over the top
              of his head, scampers along his arm to the wrist, turns
              around and scampers back. The guards just stand there,
              staring.

                                  DEL
                        Ain't he sumpthin now? Ain't Mr.
                        Jingles smart?

                                  PAUL
                        Mr. Jingles?

                                  DEL
                        Dat his name. He whisper it in my
                        ear. Cap'n, can I have a box for
                        my mouse so he can sleep in here
                        wi' me?

                                  PAUL
                        I notice your English gets better
                        when you want something.

                                  DEL
                        Wanna see what else he can do?
                        Watch, watch, watch...

              He puts the mouse on the floor, grabs a small wooden spool.
              The mouse sees it, poises like a man getting ready for a race.

                                  DEL
                        We play fetch, Mr. Jingles? We
                        play fetch?

              He tosses the spool across the floor, bounces it against the
              wall. The mouse goes after it like a dog after a stick--and
              proceeds to push it back to the bunk, rolling it with its
              front paws all the way to Delacroix's feet.

              By now, the guard's jaws are hanging open. Paul's got a funny
              little chill running up his spine.

                                  DEL
                        He fetch it ever' time. Smart as
                        hell, ain't he? We do da trick
                        again, watch, watch, watch...

              Again he throws the spool. Again the mouse goes after it,
              starts rolling it back. Del howls with laughter, claps his
              hands like a kid. Brutal murmurs to the others:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Who's training who here?

                                  COFFEY
                        That's some smart mouse, Del. Like
                        he's a circus mouse or something.

                                  DEL
                        A circus mouse! Dat jus' what he
                        is, too! A circus mouse! I get
                        outta here, he make me rich, see
                        if he don't!

              He picks up the spool again, makes a drumroll sound, tosses
              it. The mouse does its thing, rolling the spool back...

              ...as Percy enters the scene. Del catches sight of him and
              scoops up his mouse, drawing fearfully back on his bunk. He
              tries to hide Mr. Jingles in his hands--but the mouse
              wriggles from his grasp and scampers up on top of his head,
              where he regards Percy with mistrustful, beady mouse eyes.

                                  PERCY
                        Well, well. Looks like you found
                        yourself a new friend, Eddie.

              Del tries to offer some defiance--but all he can manage is:

                                  DEL
                        Don' hurt him, 'kay? 'kay?

              Percy shrugs as if to say "no skin off me", looks to Paul.

                                  PERCY
                        That the one I chased?

                                  PAUL
                               (level)
                        Yes, that's the one. Only Del says
                        his name is Mr. Jingles.

                                  PERCY
                        Is that so?

              Paul trades a look with the others, everybody wondering just
              what the hell's going through Percy's mind.

                                  PAUL
                        Del was just asking for a box. He
                        thinks the mouse will sleep in it,
                        I guess. That he might keep it for
                        a pet. What do you think?

                                  PERCY
                        I think it'll shit up his nose
                        some night and run away, but I
                        guess that's Del's lookout.
                               (beat)
                        We oughtta find a cigar box. Get
                        some cotton batting from he
                        dispensary to line it with. That
                        should do real nice.

              Percy walks away, leaving them dumbstruck. Paul turns to the
              others. Of all the things they've seen in the last few
              minutes, Percy being nice is the most amazing of all.

                                  PAUL
                        Man said get a cigar box.

              Paul comes up the stairs to the warden's office...

              INT. WARDEN MOORES' OFFICE - DAY

              ...and enters to find Hal staring out the window.

                                  PAUL
                        Hal? You wanted to see me?

                                  HAL
                        Yeah. Paul. Close the door.

              Hal's speech is halting, his thoughts disjointed and slow:

                                  HAL
                        Uh. So you know. You got a new
                        prisoner coming in tomorrow.
                        William Wharton. Young kid. Wild
                        as hell, judging from this...

              He picks up the report, trying to focus his thoughts:

                                  HAL
                        ...been rambling all over the
                        state last few years, causing all
                        kinds of trouble. Finally hit big
                        time. Killed three people in a
                        holdup, including a pregnant
                        woman. Got "Billy the Kid"
                        tattooed on his left arm...bad
                        news all around...

              He trails off, no longer able to focus on the words. Paul is
              shocked to see tears spill silently down his cheeks.

                                  PAUL
                        Hal?

                                  HAL
                        It's a tumor, Paul. A brain tumor.

              Paul doesn't know what to say. Hal looks at him.

                                  HAL
                        They got X-ray pictures of it.
                        It's the size of a lemon, they
                        said, and way down deep inside
                        where they can't operate. They say
                        she'll be dead by Christmas. I
                        haven't told her. I can't think
                        how. For the life of me, Paul, I
                        can't think how to tell my wife
                        she's going to die.

              Hal Moores, one of the toughest and steadiest men you'd ever
              meets, starts to cry. He dissolves into great big gasping
              sobs, losing all control.

              Paul lies awake, watching Jan sleep. He looks troubled--not
              to mention feverish. It occurs to him how badly he has to
              pee. He sits up, clutching at a queasy stab of pain in his
              groin...

              LIVING ROOM STAIRS

              ...and comes hurrying down the steps, clutching himself...

              EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

              ...and he's moving even faster as he exits the kitchen,
              racing for the outhouse. He realizes he's not going to make
              it, stops to piss near the woodpile at the corner of the
              house...

              ...and as he does, he's hit with the most stunning pain of
              his life. He buckles to his knees--it's only his flailing
              hand against the woodpile that prevents him from going face-
              first into his own piss. He crams his other hand to his mouth
              in an enormous effort not to scream and wake his wife.

              He manages to ride it out until his bladder empties. He falls
              onto his side, rolls over on the grass, and stares up at the
              sky with both hands pressed to his groin.

                                  PAUL

              Paul looks feverish and clammy as he buttons up his uniform
              jacket. Jan is packing his lunch, throwing him looks, knowing
              how sick he is.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm going.

              We see a tattoo: "Billy the Kid." TILT UP to WILLIAM WHARTON
              staring out the window, wearing a hospital gown, his face
              utterly blank. He looks heavily medicated.

              Harry, Dean, and Percy enter. Billy doesn't react, just keeps
              staring out. Harry waves his fingers in Billy's face.

                                  HARRY
                        Boy's doped to the gills. Dean,
                        hand me them clothes...

              Dean relays some folded prison clothes to Harry.

                                  HARRY
                        William Wharton! Hey! I'm talking
                        to you! Put these clothes on!

              Billy turns with a vacant look, takes the clothes. He fumbles
              with the shirt, drops the pants. Harry and Dean sigh.

              They strip Billy's hospital gown off and proceed to put the
              shirt on him, guiding his limp arms through the sleeves.

                                  PERCY
                        Hellraiser, huh? Looks more like
                        a limp noodle to me. Hey! Hey, you!

              Billy looks up, meets Percy's eyes.

                        gonna ride the lightning, son!

              Percy does a quick impression of a man jittering and jerking
              in the electric chair.

                                  PERCY
                        Bzzzzzzzzt-zap! Just like that!

                        C'mon, Percy, give us a hand.

              Laughing, Percy picks up the pants. They proceed to help
              Billy into them one leg at a time...

              Paul is trying to piss. Except for a few drops hitting the
              bowl, excruciating pain seems to be the only result. He gives
              up, grabs a towel, wipes the sweat from his feverish face...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              ...and steps gingerly from the toilet. Del's watching.

                        you runnin' you a fever.

              Paul shoots him a baleful look--no kidding. Another voice
              calls softly from further down the Mile:

                                  COFFEY (O.S.)
                        Boss Edgecomb? Needs ta see you

                        John Coffey. You be still in your
                        cell now, y'hear?

              Coffey falls silent. Paul goes to the entrance door and peers
              through the viewing slot, anxious to have this over with...

              EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN PENITENTIARY - DAY

              The prison truck appears, swaying along the rutted road...

              IN THE TRUCK

              ...while Billy Wharton stares at nothing, drool dripping from
              his slack mouth in long strings.

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Paul watches the truck pull in. He draws away from the slot,
              proceeds toward the empty cell which used to be
              Bitterbuck's...

              ANGLE ON TRUCK

              The rear doors are swung open. Harry emerges. Dean and Percy
              are guiding Billy by the arm, helping him down...

              INSIDE E BLOCK

              Paul waits at the empty cell. ANGLE PANS TIGHT to Coffey at
              his bars, eyes widening in a blossoming of some nameless fear
              or dread. Something bad's coming. A whisper:

                                  COFFEY
                        Careful.

              OUTSIDE E BLOCK

              Billy is brought to the door. Dean pulls his keys, starts to
              unlock it. We PUSH IN on Billy's face, where the tiniest
              trace of a smile is starting to grow...

              INSIDE E BLOCK

              ...and Coffey's unease grows with it. he presses his face to
              the bars, his whispering becoming more urgent:

                                  COFFEY
                        Careful. Careful.

              Paul hears him, glances back with a puzzled look. Coffey's
              gaze is directed at the door, which is being unlocked...

              THE DOOR

              ...and opened. In that moment, the slack look on Billy's face
              gives way to a wild grin. A CRAZED SCREECH leaps from his
              throat, a cross between a rebel yell and a dog being
              tortured, freezing everybody's blood in their veins--

                                  BILLY
                        Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo!

              --and he drops his wrist-chain down over Dean's head, jerks
              it tight, begins to strangle him. Dean lurches forward, Billy
              riding/propelling him through the door onto the Mile.

              Percy stands frozen in the doorway, stunned. Harry shoves him
              aside and jumps on Billy from behind, trying to get him off
              Dean. Dean is choking, turning purple.

              Paul rushes from the cell to join the fray. Billy whirls,
              delivering a stunning kick to Paul's groin. Paul's bladder
              pain goes nuclear--he falls back in agony, clutching himself
              and sucking air through his teeth, unable even to scream.

              Billy rams an elbow into Harry's face, knocks him sprawling
              on the desk, screaming and laughing and howling all the while:

                                  BILLY
                        WHOOOEE, BOYS! AIN'T THIS A PARTY,
                        NOW? IS IT, OR WHAT?

              Paul forces himself to his feet, pulls his revolver, draws
              down on Billy...

                                  PAUL
                        LET HIM GO!

              ...but Billy jerks Dean around, using him as a shield...

                                  BILLY
                        G'WAN, SHOOT! SEE WHO YA HIT!

              Dean is choking, dying. Paul is shifting his aim, trying for
              a clear shot, not getting one. Percy's still just inside the
              doorway, pressed against the wall with fear...

                                  PAUL
                        HIT HIM, PERCY! GODDAMN IT, HIT
                        HIM!

                                  BILLY
                        C'MON, PERCY, HIT ME! HIT ME, YOU
                        LIMP NOODLE, HIT ME! YEEHAWWW!

              ...and suddenly a hand comes in, grabs the hickory stick out
              of Percy's grasp, raises it high--

              --it's Brutal coming through the door. He swings the baton
              and lands an awesome blow to Billy's head--THUMP! The force
              of it spins Billy off his feet and slams him flat on his back.

              Dean crawls away, gulping ragged breaths of air. Amazingly,
              Billy's still conscious--he looks up at Brutal and laughs:

                                  BILLY
                        Big fucker. Snuck up on me. No
                        fair.

              Still laughing, he makes another grab at Dean. Brutal whacks
              him again, turning his lights out for good. Brutal drops to
              Dean's side, helping him hack air back into his lungs:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Breathe...breathe...that's it...

              Everybody's reining in their adrenaline. Paul glares at Harry.

                                  HARRY
                        We thought he was doped.

                        Didn't we? Didn't we all of us
                        think he was doped?

              Percy nods, still numb. Paul is furious:

                                  PAUL
                        You didn't ask? I guess that's not
                        a mistake you'll be need to make
                        again anytime soon, is it?

              Harry shakes his head miserably. Paul grabs Billy by the feet.

                                  PAUL
                        Grab his arms! You too, Percy!
                               (off Percy's
                                hesitation)
                        Percy, goddamn it, get your feet
                        out of cement and help us out here!

              Percy finally unfreezes. The three of them hoist Billy up in
              a dead-lift, get him in his cell, toss him on the cot. They
              step out, slam the door, lock it. Paul looks to Harry and
              Brutal.

                                  PAUL
                        Get Dean looked at right away,
                        make sure he's all right.

                        Percy, you go make a report to the
                        warden for me. Start off by saying
                        the situation is under control--
                        it's not a story, he won't
                        appreciate you drawing out the
                        suspense.

                                  BRUTAL
                        What about you? You look about
                        ready to collapse.

                                  PAUL
                        I've got the Mile till you all get
                        back. Go on now.

              They all exit. As soon as he's alone, Paul gives in to the
              pain, holding his crotch and sinking to his knees with a
              moan. It's so bad he actually lays down on the Mile, face
              pressed against the cool linoleum, wishing he were dead. A
              stretch of silence...and then:

                                  COFFEY (O.S.)
                        Boss? Needs ta see ya down here.

                                  PAUL
                        This is not a good time, John
                        Coffey. Not a good time at all.

                                  COFFEY (O.S.)
                        But I needs ta see ya, boss. I
                        needs ta talk t'ya.

              Paul sighs. Things couldn't get much worse than this. He
              rises with a supreme effort, walks painfully down the Mile...

              COFFEY'S CELL

              ...and finds Coffey waiting at his bars.

                                  COFFEY
                        Closer.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm alone here right now, John.
                        Figure this is close enough.

                                  COFFEY
                        Boss, please. I got to whisper in
                        your ear.

              Paul blinks. Maybe it's the fever clouding his brain, or
              maybe...hell, is this what being hypnotized is like? He tries
              to shake the sensation off, comes a little closer.

                                  DEL
                        Boss? You know you not s'pose to
                        do dat.

                                  PAUL
                        Mind your business, Del. What do
                        you want, John Coffey?

                                  COFFEY
                        Just to help.

              His hand shoots out, grabs Paul by the collar, jerks him
              close. Paul makes a panic-grab for his revolver...

              ...but Coffey lays his free hand atop Paul's, eases his grip
              from the gun--no need for that. Coffey's hand then drifts
              slowly down, easing to Paul's crotch...

                                  PAUL
                               (stunned, frozen)
                        What are you...doing?

              ...and something goes WHUMP through Paul's body. He arches
              back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of
              energy seems to pass from Paul through Coffey's hand...

              ...and then it's over. Paul comes back to the real world,
              weak against the bars, realizes Del is hollering in his cell:

                                  DEL
                        HELP! JOHN COFFEY'S KILLING BOSS
                        EDGECOMB! HELP!

                                  PAUL
                        Del, Chrissake, settle down, I'm
                        fine...

              It dawns on him that he really is fine. Fever's gone. So is
              the pain in his groin. John Coffey, though, seems to be
              having trouble. He sits down on his bunk, bends forward,
              gagging like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat.

                                  PAUL
                        John? John, what's wrong?

              Paul fumbles his keys to the lock, unsure if he should open
              the door, watching the big man's contortions grow stronger
              like a cat trying to cough up a hairball...

              ...and then comes an unpleasant, gagging/retching sound as
              Coffey's lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of godawful
              sneer...and he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny black
              insects. They swirl furiously in front of his face, turn
              white...and disappear. Paul just stares, stunned. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        What did you do, big boy? What did
                        you do to me?

                                  COFFEY
                        I helped it. Didn't I help it?

                                  PAUL
                        Yes, but...how?

              Coffey shrugs--it's something that just is.

                                  COFFEY
                        Just took it back, is all. Awful
                        tired now, boss. Dog tired.

              He rolls onto his bunk, faces the wall. Paul just stares at
              him, stunned. He turns and walks up the Mile, his stiffness
              and pain now gone. Del watches him go by, also stunned:

                                  DEL
                        What dat man do to you? He throw
                        some gris-gris on you?
                               (off Paul's look)
                        You look diff'int! Even walk
                        diff'int. Like y'all better!

                                  PAUL
                        You're imagining thing. Lie down,
                        Del. Get you some rest.

              Paul continues up the Mile...

              E BLOCK TOILET

              ...and steps back into the toilet. Not trusting this
              situation for even a moment, Paul opens his fly, takes a deep
              breath to prepare himself for the pain, starts to pee...

              ...and we hear a healthy stream of water hitting the bowl.
              The look on Paul's face says it all--blessed relief.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DUSK

              Paul comes home from work, still looking numb about the whole
              thing. He drifts to the kitchen door. Jan's at the counter,
              slicing vegetables for dinner. She glances at him.

                                  JAN
                        Hi, honey. How are you feeling?

                                  PAUL
                        Um...not too bad.

              She turns back. Paul's eyes drift down to admire her ass.

                                  JAN
                        What did the doctor say?

              No response. He's too busy staring. She turns again--he
              glances hastily up.

                                  PAUL
                        Oh, you know doctors. Gobble-de-
                        gook mostly.

              She turns back, keeps working. He crosses the room, eyeing
              her ass all the way...and surprised her by pressing up
              against her from behind, running his hands along her hips.

                                  JAN
                        Paul? What are you doing?

              He starts laying kisses on the back of her neck, giving her
              pleasant shivers, murmuring:

                                  PAUL
                        What's it feel like?

                                  JAN
                        I know what it feels like...it
                        feels great...but...Paul...

              He's getting her breathless. She turns into his arms and they
              get into some passionate kissing. It's not too long before
              they're frantically peeling each other's clothes off...

              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

              ...and we find them having a wild tumble in the sheets, both
              moaning and groaning, sweating and panting. She pushes him
              flat on the bed, pauses to catch her breath...

                                  JAN
                        Those must've been some pills.

              ...and they keep going, rutting like crazed weasels...

              EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

              ...as their moans go drifting into the night...

                                                       FADE TO:

              SAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - DAWN

              ...and they're still moaning up there as the sun creeps up.

              INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

              Jan falls back, exhausted after the latest go-round. She
              catches her breath, looks over at Paul, and finally:

                                  JAN
                        Paul? Not that I'm complaining.
                        But we haven't gone four times in
                        one night since we were nineteen.
                               (off his look)
                        You wanna tell me just what the
                        hell's going on?

                                  PAUL
                        Well...thing is...I never actually
                        got to the doctor yesterday...

              She gives him a look--oh?

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

              Paul is on the phone:

                                  PAUL
                        Brutal? Listen...I'm thinking of
                        taking the morning off sick. You
                        cover the fort for me?
                               (beat)
                        That's swell. Thanks. Yeah, I'm
                        sure I'll feel better. Okay.

              He hangs up, turns to Jan.

                                  JAN
                        You sure you ought to do this?

                                  PAUL
                        I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. ROAD TO TEFTON - DAY

              Paul's model T comes putt-putting up the road past a sign:
              "Trapingus County Welcomes You."

              EXT. HOUSE IN TEFTON - BACK PORCH - DAY

              BURT HAMMERSMITH, public defender for Trapingus County, sits
              with a cold soda and a magazine, watching his TWO CHILDREN
              playing on a swing at the far end of the backyard. The screen
              door opens and CYNTHIA HAMMERSMITH ushers Paul out.

                                  CYNTHIA
                        I offer you a cold drink?

                                  PAUL
                        Yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be
                        fine. Thank you.

              She goes back inside. Burt rises.

                                  PAUL
                        Mr. Hammersmith. Your office said
                        I'd find you at home today. I hope
                        I'm not troubling you.

                                  BURT
                        That depends, Mr.--?

                                  PAUL
                        Paul Edgecomb. I'm the E Block
                        superintendant at Cold Mountain.

                                  BURT
                        The Green Mile. I've heard of it.
                        Lost a few clients your way.

                                  PAUL
                        That's why I'm here. I'd like to
                        ask you about one of them.

              Burt settles back down, motions "please sit".

                                  BURT
                        Which client? Now you got my
                        curiosity aroused.

                                  PAUL
                        John Coffey.

                                  BURT
                        Ah, Coffey. He causing you
                        problems?

                                  PAUL
                        No, can't say he is. He doesn't
                        like the dark. He cries on
                        occasion. Other than that...

                                  BURT
                        Cries, does he? Well, he's got a
                        lot to cry about, I'd say. You
                        know what he did.

                                  PAUL
                               (nods)
                        I read the court transcripts.

              Cynthia reappears, hands Paul a cold root beer.

                                  PAUL
                        Thank you, Missus.

                                  CYNTHIA
                        My pleasure. Kids! Lunch is about
                        ready! Y'all come on up!

              She goes back inside, but the kids aren't quite able to tear
              themselves away from their play.

                                  BURT
                        What exactly are you trying to
                        find out? Satisfy my curiosity,
                        I'll see if I can satisfy yours.

                                  PAUL
                        I've wondered if he ever did
                        anything like that before.

                                  BURT
                        Why? Has he said anything?

                                  PAUL
                        No. But a man who does a thing
                        like that has often developed a
                        taste for it over time. Occurred
                        to me it might be easy enough to
                        follow his backtrail and find out.
                        A man his size, and colored to
                        boot, can't be that hard to trace.

                                  BURT
                        You'd think so, but you'd be
                        wrong. Believe me, we tried. It's
                        like he dropped out of the sky.

                                  PAUL
                        How do you explain that?

                                  BURT
                        We're in a Depression. A third of
                        the country's out of work.

                        People are drifting by the
                        thousands, looking for work,
                        looking for that greener grass.
                        Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't
                        get noticed everywhere he goes...
                        not until he kills a couple of
                        little girls.

                                  PAUL
                        He's...strange, I admit. But there
                        doesn't seem to be any real
                        violence in him. I know violent
                        men, Mr. Hammersmith. I deal with
                        'em day in and day out.

              Burt smiles, realizing:

                                  BURT
                        You didn't come up here to ask me
                        whether he might have killed
                        before. You came up here to see if
                        I think he did it at all. That's
                        it, isn't it?

                                  PAUL
                        Do you?

                                  BURT
                        One seldom sees a less ambiguous
                        case. He was found with the
                        victims in his arms. Blurted out
                        a confession right then and there.

                                  PAUL
                        Yet you defended him.

                                  BURT
                        Everyone is entitled to a defense.

              Cynthia hollers from an open window:

                                  CYNTHIA
                        Kids! Lunch!

                                  BURT
                        Y'all listen to your Momma, now!

              The kids start this way. Burt turns back to Paul.

                                  BURT
                        Tell you something. You listen
                        close, too, because it might be
                        something you need to know.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm listening.

                                  BURT
                        We had us a dog. No particular
                        breed, but gentle. Ready to lick
                        your hand or fetch a stick. Just
                        a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.
                               (Paul nods)
                        In many way, a good mongrel dog is
                        like you negro. You get to know
                        it, and often you get to love it.
                        It is of no particular use, but
                        you keep it around because you
                        think it loves you. If you're
                        lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never
                        have to find out any different. My
                        wife and I were not so lucky.
                        Caleb. Come here for a second.

              The little boy comes to him, staring at his feet. Burt tires
              to raise the boy's chin. The boy resists for a moment...

                                  BURT
                        Please, son.

              ...and then his face comes around. He's horribly scarred on
              that side, the eye missing.

                                  BURT
                        He has the one eye. I suppose he's
                        lucky not to be blind. We get down
                        on our knees and thank God for
                        that much at least. Right Caleb?
                               (the boy nods shyly)
                        Okay, go on in now.

              The boy races inside after his sister. Paul follows Burt's
              gaze off toward the rear of the property, where an unoccupied
              doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds.

                                  BURT
                        That dog attacked my boy for no
                        reason. Just got it into his mind
                        one day. Same with John Coffey. He
                        was sorry afterwards, of that I
                        have no doubt...but those little
                        girls stayed raped and murdered
                        nonetheless. Maybe he's never done
                        it before--my dog never bit
                        before, but I didn't concern
                        myself with that. I went out there
                        with my rifle and grabbed his
                        collar and blew his brains out.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm sorry for your trouble.

              Burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod.

                                  BURT
                        I'm as enlightened as the next
                        man, Mr. Edgecomb. I would not
                        bring back slavery for all the tea
                        in China. I believe we have to be
                        humane and generous in our efforts
                        to solve the race problem. But we
                        have to remember that the negro
                        will bite if he gets the chance,
                        just like a mongrel dog will bite
                        if it crosses its mind to do so.
                               (beat)
                        Is Coffey guilty? Yes, he is.
                        Don't you doubt it, and don't you
                        turn your back on him. You might
                        get away with it once or even a
                        hundred times...but in the end...

              He raises his hand, making biting motions with his fingers.

                                  BURT
                        You understand?

              Paul says nothing. Burt gazes out again. Softly:

                                  BURT
                        I'm gonna have to tear that old
                        doghouse down one of these days.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. PAUL'S MODEL T - DAY

              Paul drives back to Cold Mountain, his heart conflicted...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              ...and he walks onto the Mile with a bundle wrapped in a dish
              towel. Brutal glances up from the desk, sniffing the air.

                                  PAUL
                        No, it's not for you.

              Paul continues down the Mile. Whatever he's carrying, the
              smell of it brings Del to his bars. Even Mr.Jingles comes
              skittering out of his cigar box, sniffing.

                                  DEL
                        Oh. Oh my.

              Paul arrives at Coffey's cell. Coffey's on his bunk facing
              the wall. His head comes around, drawn by the aroma. He sits
              up, wipes the tears leaking from his eyes, looks at Paul.

                                  COFFEY
                        I'm smelling me some cornbread.

              Paul speaks softly so the others can't hear:

                                  PAUL
                        It's from my missus. She wanted to
                        thank you.

              Coffey nods thoughtfully, absorbing this notion. Then:

                                  COFFEY
                        Thank me for what?

                                  PAUL
                        You know. For helping me.

                                  COFFEY
                        Helping you with what?

              Paul motions discreetly to his crotch.

                                  COFFEY
                        Ohhh.
                               (beat)
                        Was your missus pleased?

                                  PAUL
                        Several times.

              Paul hands him the bundle through the bars. Coffey takes it,
              uncovers the cornbread reverently, gazes back up.

                                  COFFEY
                        This all for me?

              Paul nods. Across the way, Del is pressing his face longingly
              through the bars while Mr. Jingles crawls on his shoulder.

                                  DEL
                        Oh my. John, I can smell it from
                        here. I surely can.

                                  COFFEY
                               (looks to Paul)
                        Can I give some to Del?

                                  PAUL
                        It's yours, John. You do with it
                        as you please.

              John carefully scoops a big chunk of cornbread out with his
              enormous hand, holds it through the bars to Paul.

                                  COFFEY
                        Here's for Del and Mr. Jingles
                        then.

                                  BILLY
                        Hey! What about me? I'm'a get some
                        too, ain't I

              Coffey looks to Paul--do I have to?

                                  PAUL
                        It's yours, John. As you please.

                                  COFFEY
                        Well. Fine. I think I'll keep the
                        rest, then.

              He smiles like a big kid, digging in with his fingers. Paul
              crosses the Mile to Del's cell, hands him his share.

                                  PAUL
                        Courtesy of the gentleman across
                        the way.

                                  DEL
                        Oh, John. So very fine of you. So
                        very kind. Mr. Jingles t'ank you.

                                  COFFEY
                               (mouth full)
                        ...wel'cm...

                                  BILLY
                        Hey! What about me? Don't you hold
                        out on me, ya big dummy nigger!

              Paul's temper flares--he steps to Billy's cell.

                                  PAUL
                        You'll keep a civil tongue on my
                        block.

              Beat. Billy spits in Paul's face and follows it up with a big
              grin--what are you gonna do about that? Paul is seething as
              he wipes the spit off, but keeps his temper where it belongs.

                                  PAUL
                        You get that one for free. But
                        that's the last one.

              Paul walks away. Billy laughs, hollering after him:

                                  BILLY
                        That's it? Just that little bitty
                        one? Guess I'll have to pay out
                        for the rest, huh?

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Harry is walking the Mile, doing a cell check and jotting on
              a clipboard. He pauses, making a notation...

              ...and a long stream of piss hits his leg. Billy's at his
              bars, peeing on him. Harry jumps back, stunned. Billy howls
              with laughter, hosing his aim wildly from side to side.

                                  BILLY
                        Yeehaaw! Good shot, weren't it?
                        Oh, the look on your face!

              Paul and Brutal come running. Harry's just flabbergasted:

                                  HARRY
                        You believe this? Son of a bitch
                        pissed on me!

                                  BILLY
                        Hey, d'jall like that? I'm
                        currently cooking some turds t'go
                        with it! Nice soft ones! I'll have
                        'em out t'yall tomorrow!

              Paul stays calm, turns to Brutal, nods at the restraint room.

                                  PAUL
                        We've been looking to clear that
                        room out anyway.

                                                       TIMECUT:

              A STREAM OF GUARDS comes toting the last of the restraint
              room stuff past Billy's cell while he heckles them from the
              bars...

                                  BILLY
                        Hey! Whassit now, movin' day?
                        Y'all wanna come in and dust a
                        little? Y'can shine my knob for me
                        while yer at it!

              ...and he pauses as Paul and Brutal step to the bars. Paul
              has a canvas straitjacket. Brutal pulls his nightstick.

                                  BILLY
                        You can come in here on your legs,
                        but you'll go out on your backs,
                        Billy the Kid guarantee ya that.
                               (motions to Brutal)
                        C'mon, fuckstick. No sneakin' up
                        on me this time. We'll go man to
                        man, see who's the better fel--

              Brutal unlocks the cell--and sidesteps, revealing Harry
              pointing a fire hose. The hose erupts, driving Billy across
              the cell with bone-jarring force. They batter him half-
              senseless, then cut the water. Billy collapses in a heap.

              Paul and Brutal drag him semi-conscious from his cell and get
              the straitjacket on him. He comes around as they draw the
              straps tight and pull him to his feet.

                                  PAUL
                        C'mon, Wild Bill. Little walky
                        walky.

                                  BILLY
                        Don't you call me that! Wild Bill
                        Hickock wasn't no range rider! He
                        was just a bushwackin' John Law!
                        Dumb sonovabitch sat with his back
                        to the door and kilt by a drunk!

                                  BRUTAL
                        Oh, my suds and body! A history
                        lesson! You just never know what
                        you're gonna get when you come to
                        work everyday on the Green Mile.
                        Thank you, Wild Bill.

              Billy lets out a scream of rage and throws himself at Brutal.
              Brutal, bored, shoves him back toward Paul, who then propels
              him down the Mile toward the open restraint room door. Billy
              sees where they intend to put him, resorts to pleading:

                                  BILLY
                        Oh, not in there! C'mon now, I'll
                        be good! Honest Injun I will! No!
                        No! Ummmmhhhh...urg...ah!

              He suddenly drops to the floor, bucking and jerking wildly,
              spewing drool. Harry's eyes go wide.

                                  HARRY
                        Holy Christ, he's pitchin' a fit!

              Paul reaches down and unceremoniously starts dragging Billy
              kicking and writhing the rest of the way.

                                  PAUL
                        He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on
                        this one.

              Brutal helps Paul toss Billy headlong into the padded room.
              They slam the door...

              RESTRAINT ROOM

              ...and Billy staggers to his feet in the straitjacket,
              inarticulate with rage, starts throwing himself against the
              door, screaming at the top of his lungs.

                                  BILLY
                        ALL I WANTED ME WAS A LITTLE
                        CORNBREAD, YOU MUTHERFUCKERS!

                                                       FADE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - NEXT DAY

              Paul and Brutal unlock the restraint room. Billy looks up
              from the corner, pale and drained. Softly:

                                  BILLY
                        I learnt my lesson. I'll be good.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Billy's back in his cell, quiet for a change. Toot-Toot is
              outside the bars, mopping the floor. Billy notices a
              chocolate Moon Pie in Toot's shirt pocket.

                                  BILLY
                        Pssss. Hey. Give'ya nickel for
                        that Moon Pie.

              Toot looks around. Nobody's watching, and a nickel's a
              nickel. He steps to Billy's bars, swaps the Moon Pie for the
              money.

              Toot hurries away. Billy unwraps the Moon Pie, makes sure
              he's not being watched...and crams the entire thing into his
              mouth...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and here comes Brutal strolling down the Mile, doing a
              cell check and jotting on a clipboard. He pauses, seeing:

              Billy at his bars. Just standing there staring. His cheeks
              bulging way out.

              Brutal steps closer, fascinated...what the fuck is that.
              Billy waits until he's just a bit closer--

              --and he slams his fists against his own cheeks, propelling
              a disgusting spew of liquefied chocolate sludge into Brutal's
              face. Billy falls back onto his bunk, shrieking with laughter:

                                  BILLY
                        Li'l Black Sambo, yassuh, boss,
                        yassuh, howdoo you do?

                                  BRUTAL
                               (beat, calmly)
                        Hope your bags are packed.

                                                       TIMECUT:

              ...and once again, Billy gets dragged to the restraint room,
              kicking and screaming all the way. They toss him in, slam the
              door. Brutal turns, still wiping traces of sludge off.

                                  PAUL
                        The Moon Pie thing was pretty
                        original. Gotta give him that.

              Brutal nods. They walk away as we

                                                       FADE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Paul and Brutal appear at Del's bars with Harry and Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        Del, grab your things. Big day for
                        you and Mr. Jingles.

                                  DEL
                        Whatchoo talkin' bout?

                                  PAUL
                        Important folks heard about your
                        mouse, wanna see him perform. Not
                        just guards, either. One of them's
                        a politician all the way from the
                        state capital, I believe.

              Del swells with pride upon hearing this. He scrounges up Mr.
              Jingles props, steps from his cell, looks to Harry and Dean.

                                  DEL
                        You fellas comin'?

                                  HARRY
                        We got other fish to fry just now,
                        Del, but you knock 'em for a loop.

              Del nods, beaming happily, looks to Coffey in his cell.

                                  COFFEY
                        You knock 'em for a loop like Mr.
                        Harry says, Del.

              Brutal leads Del up the Mile, Paul and the others at their
              heels. Percy's at the duty desk. He smirks and rolls his eyes
              as Del goes by. The moment Brutal and Del are out the door...

              ...Toot emerges from Paul's office where he's been hiding.

                                  PAUL
                        Let's move along briskly, folks.
                        There's not much time.

              Toot hurries down to take his place in Del's cell.

                                  TOOT
                        I'm sittin' down, I'm sittin'
                        down, I'm sittin' down.

              INT. OFFICE/ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY

              A HALF DOZEN GUARDS are waiting. We find Bill Dodge fixing
              the tie of a fat good ol' boy named EARL.

                                  EARL
                        Been sweepin' floors here ten
                        years, never had to wear no damn
                        tie before.

                                  BILL
                        You're a V.I.P. today, Earl, so
                        just shut up.

              A KNOCK at the door. Everybody takes a seat. Del is ushered
              in by Brutal. Del faces his audience, puts his hands to his
              chest in a "thank you" gesture worthy of Lillie Langtry
              before her adoring public, then announces grandly:

                                  DEL
                        Messieurs et mesdames! Bienvenue
                        au cirque de mousie!

              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - DAY

              The steel cap is lowered over Toot's head, the straps
              tightened. TILT UP to Percy as:

                                  PERCY
                        Roll on two.

              Behind his partition, Van Hay mimes flipping the switch.

                                  VAN HAY
                        That's that.

              A pause. Percy looks anxiously to Paul, who's trading glances
              with the other guards. Finally:

                                  PAUL
                        Very good. Very professional.

              Percy smiles. Harry and Dean step up, slapping his back and
              shaking his hand...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              ...and they're still chatting a short time later, waiting for
              Del's return. Percy actually looks happy for a change,
              feeling genuinely accepted for the first time...

              Billy is watching from his cell. Just watching.

              The door opens. Del returns with Mr. Jingles on his shoulder,
              escorted by Brutal. Brutal is toting the cigar box and spool
              like a magician's assistant carrying the boss' props.

                                  PAUL
                        Well?

                                  DEL
                        They love Mr. Jingles! They laugh
                        and cheer and clap they hands!

                                  PERCY
                        Well, that's just aces. Pop back
                        in your cell, old-timer.

              The generosity of Percy's tone catches Del completely off
              guard. Del gives him a look of almost comical mistrust...

              ...and the old Percy comes back. He bares his teeth in a mock
              snarl and curls his fingers as if to grab Del. It's a joke,
              but Del doesn't know that--he jerks back in fear and trips
              over Brutal's big feet. Del goes down hard, hitting the
              linoleum with the back of his head. Mr. Jingles jumps clear,
              goes squeaking down the Mile. Del sits up, painfully
              clutching his head. Brutal helps him up...

                                  BRUTAL
                        Percy, you shit.

              ...and moves him toward his cell. Percy is actually moved to
              apologize--he starts after them with a half-laugh, drifting
              much too close to Wild Bill's side of the Mile...

                                  PERCY
                        Del! Hey, you numb wit, I didn't
                        mean nothin' by it! You all ri--

              ...and Wild Bill's arms thrust out, grabbing Percy and
              slamming him back against the bars with an arm around his
              throat. Percy squeals like a pig in a slaughter-chute,
              thinking he's gonna die. The guards scramble, drawing their
              clubs--as Billy strokes Percy's hair and whispers in his ear:

                                  BILLY
                        Ain't you sweet. Soft. Like a
                        girl. I druther fuck your asshole
                        than your sister's pussy, I think.

              Billy kisses Percy's ear--and his hand drops down to squeeze
              Percy's crotch. Paul pulls his sidearm, taking aim...

                                  PAUL
                        Wharton!

              ...and Billy lets go, stepping back with his hands raised,
              laughing. Percy darts across the Mile in terror and cringes
              against the cell opposite, breathing so loud and fast it
              almost sounds like sobbing.

                                  BILLY
                        I let 'im go, I'us just playin'
                        and I let 'im go! Never hurt a
                        hair on his purty head!
                               (grins at Percy)
                        Your noodle ain't limp at all,
                        loverboy! I think you sweet on ol'
                        Billy the Kid...
                               (sniffs his fingers)
                        ...oooh, but smell you.

              Down at his cell, Del starts laughing shrilly. Everybody else
              starts to realize it, including Percy himself...he looks
              down, sees the huge dark stain spreading at his crotch.

                                  DEL
                        Lookit, he done piss his pants!
                        Look what the big man done! He
                        bus' other people wid 'is stick,
                        mais oui some mauvais homme, but
                        someone touch him, he make water
                        in his pants jus' like a baby!

              Percy just stares. Brutal shoves Delacroix into his cell.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Shut up, Del.

              Paul steps to Percy, puts a hand on his shoulder. Percy
              shakes his hand off, looks around at their faces, whispers:

                                  PERCY
                        You talk about this to anyone,
                        I'll get you all fired. I swear
                        that to God.

                                  PAUL
                        What happens on the Mile, stays on
                        the Mile. Always has.

              The men nod solemnly. Nobody's going to talk about this.
              Percy looks at Delacroix still snorting in his cell, points
              at him.

                                  PERCY
                        You keep laughing, you French-
                        fried faggot. You just keep
                        laughing.

              Del falls silent. Percy turns and storms away as we

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                          "The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix"

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. DEL'S CELL - DAY

              Paul is sitting with Delacroix. Brutal is leaning against the
              bars. Del is throwing the spool. Mr. Jingles is fetching it.

              The silence is thick. Just the clack-clatter of the spool,
              and the skitter skitter of tiny mouse paws on concrete. It's
              getting on Paul's nerves in a big way. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        What about Dean? He's got a little
                        boy would love a pet mouse, I bet.

              Del looks horrified at the thought.

                                  DEL
                        How could a boy be trust wid Mr.
                        Jingles? Maybe forget to feed him.
                        And how he keep up wid his
                        trainin', just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

              Del tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter-skitter.

                                  PAUL
                        All right, I'll take him.

                                  DEL
                        T'ank you kindly, merci beaucoup,
                        but you live out in the woods, and
                        Mr. Jingles, he be scared to live
                        out dans la foret.

                                  PAUL
                        He whisper that in your ear?

              Del nods, tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter
              skitter. Paul is completely out of ideas. But then:

                                  BRUTAL
                        How about Mouseville?

                                  DEL
                        Mouseville?

                                  BRUTAL
                        Tourist attraction down in
                        Florida. Tallahassee, I think. Is
                        that right, Paul? Tallahassee?

                                  PAUL
                               (level)
                        Yeah, that's right. Tallahassee.
                        Just down the road apiece from the
                        dog university.

              Brutal's mouth twitches, but he manages to keep a straight
              face. He gives Paul a look--don't blow this.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?
                        You think he's got the stuff?

                                  PAUL
                        Might. He's pretty smart.

                                  DEL
                        Hey! What dis Mouseville?

                                  BRUTAL
                        Tourist attraction, I said. They
                        got this big tent you go into--

                                  DEL
                        Like a cirque? You have to pay?

                                  BRUTAL
                        You shittin' me? Course you pay.
                        Dime a piece, two cents for the
                        kids. And inside the tent there's
                        this mouse city made out of boxes
                        and toilet paper rolls...

              Percy is drifting up the block, listening too, but nobody's
              really paying him much mind.

                                  BRUTAL
                        ...plus they got the Mouseville
                        All-Star Circus. There's mice that
                        swing on trapeze, mice that roll
                        barrels, mice that stack coins...

                                  DEL
                        Dat's it! Dat's da place for Mr.
                        Jingles! You gonna be a circus
                        mouse after all! Gonna live in a
                        mouse city down in Florida!

              Del tosses the spool extra hard--it takes a bad bounce off
              the wall and goes clattering through the bars onto the Mile.
              The mouse goes after it like a shot, too intent to notice:

              His old enemy Percy.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Percy, no!

              Percy stomps the heel of his heavy work shoe down on Mr.
              Jingles. There's a SOFT SNAP as the mouse's back breaks.

              Del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars, sobbing
              the mouse's name. Percy looks to Brutal and Paul, smiles.

                                  PERCY
                        Knew I'd get him sooner or later.
                        Just a matter of time, really.

              He turns and strolls up the Mile, leaving Mr. Jingles dying
              in a tiny pool of blood. Up at the duty desk, Dean and Harry
              get up from a cribbage game, stunned and furious.

              Percy strolls past, exits to the execution chamber. Del is
              still screaming, all his pent-up terror and grief pouring out
              at the dying mouse. And then comes a soft, urgent voice:

                                  COFFEY
                        Give'm to me.

              They turn. Coffey's got his arms out through his bars, one
              massive hand spread open.

                                  COFFEY
                        Give'm to me. Might still be time.

              Paul hesitates, scoops the mouse up off the floor, wincing at
              the feel of it. Splintered bones are poking at the hide.

                                  BRUTAL
                        What are you doing?

              Paul doesn't answer, just lays Mr. Jingles into Coffey's
              hand. Coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and lays his
              other hand gently over it, cupping the creature. All we see
              now is the tail hanging out the side, twitching weakly.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Paul, what the hell--

              Paul motions him quiet. Del is pleading softly at his bars:

                                  DEL
                        Please, John. Oh Johnny, help him,
                        please help him, s'il vous plait.

              Harry and Dean join the group. Everybody watching now.

              Coffey puts his mouth to his cupped hands, inhales sharply.
              The world hangs suspended for a moment. Coffey raises his
              face, contorting as if desperately ill, starts making those
              horrendous choking sounds in his throat...

                                  BRUTAL
                               (softly)
                        Oh, dear Jesus. The tail. Look at
                        the tail.

              They do. The tail is no longer weak and dying. It's snapping
              briskly back and forth, as if ready to play.

              Coffey makes that retching/gagging sound...and again exhales
              a cloud of swirling black "insects" from his nose and mouth.
              The men watch, speechless, as the bugs turn white and
              disappear.

              Coffey bends down, opens his hand. Mr. Jingles bounds off his
              fingers through the bars, racing past the guards' feet. They
              turn to see Del gather the mouse up, laughing and crying.
              Dean turns back to Coffey with a stunned whisper:

                                  DEAN
                        What did you do?

                                  COFFEY
                        I helped Del's mouse. He a circus
                        mouse. Goan live in a mouse city
                        down in...down in...

                                  BRUTAL
                               (numb)
                        Florida?

              Coffey nods, remembering.

                                  COFFEY
                        Boss Percy's bad. He mean. He step
                        on Del's mouse.
                               (softly)
                        I took it back, though.

              And with that, he lies back on his bunk and faces the wall.
              The others look to Paul, don't even know what to say.

                                  PAUL
                        Brute, come along with me.
                               (to Harry and Dean)
                        You fellas go on back to you
                        cribbage game.

              Harry nods numbly. Paul leads Brutal up the Mile...

              EXECUTION CHAMBER

              ...and they enter to find Percy polishing Old Sparky's arms.

                                  PERCY
                        Don't start in on me. It was just
                        a mouse. Never belonged here in
                        the first place.

                                  PAUL
                        The mouse is fine. Just fine.
                        You're no better at mouse-killing
                        than anything else around here.

                                  PERCY
                        You expect me to believe that? I
                        heard the goddamn thing crunch.

              Paul steps closer, angry as we've ever seen him:

                                  PAUL
                        Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is
                        okay? After all our talks about
                        how we should keep the prisoners
                        calm? Aren't you relieved?

                                  PERCY
                        What kind of game is this?

                                  PAUL
                        No game. See for yourself.

              Beat. Percy stalks past them, heads out onto the Mile. Paul
              and Brutal just wait, saying nothing. Brutal picks up the rag
              left by Percy, resumes polishing chores on Old Sparky. Paul
              stretches, cracks his neck. The silence heavy...

              ...until Percy reappears.

                                  PERCY
                        You switched them! You switched
                        them somehow, you bastards!

                                  BRUTAL
                        I always keep a spare mouse in my
                        wallet for occasions such as this.

                                  PERCY
                        You're playing with me, the both
                        of you! Just who the hell do you
                        think you are--

              Brutal grabs him , slams him bodily into the electric chair.
              Paul bends close, gets right in Percy's face.

                                  PAUL
                        We're the people you work with,
                        Percy, but not for long. I want
                        your word.

                                  PERCY
                        My word?

                                  PAUL
                        I put you out front for Del, you
                        put in your transfer to Briar
                        Ridge the very next day.

                                  PERCY
                        What if I just call up certain
                        people and tell them you're
                        harassing me? Bullying me?

                                  PAUL
                        Go ahead. I promise you'll leave
                        your share of blood on the floor.

                                  PERCY
                        Over a mouse? You think anyone's
                        gonna give two shits?

                                  PAUL
                        No. But four men will swear you
                        stood by while Wild Bill tried to
                        strangle Dean to death. About that
                        people will care, Percy. Even your
                        uncle the governor will care.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Thing like that goes in your work
                        record. Work record can follow a
                        man around a long, long time.

              Percy looks from one man to another, knowing he's trapped.

                                  PAUL
                        I put you out front, you put in
                        your transfer. That's the deal.

              Percy thinks it over, nods. He tries to get up, but Paul keep
              him pinned...and pointedly offer his hand.

                                  PAUL
                        You make a promise to a man, you
                        shake his hand.

              Percy hesitates, shakes Paul's hand...

              HIGH WIDE ANGLE OF EXECUTION CHAMBER

              ...and Paul pulls him out of the electric chair as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              SAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - NEXT NIGHT

              Witnesses are trickling in, filling the seats. A storm is
              brewing, sending FLASHES OF LIGHTNING across the floors.

              INT. DEL'S CELL - NIGHT

              Del sits with Mr. Jingles in his lap, stroking the mouse
              between the ears. Paul, Brutal, and Harry appear at the bars.

                                  DEL
                        Hey, boys. Say hi, Mr. Jingles.

                                  PAUL
                        Eduard Delacroix, will you step
                        forward?

                                  DEL
                        Boss Edgecomb?

                                  PAUL
                        Yes, Del?

                                  DEL
                        Don' let nothin' happen to Mr.
                        Jingles, okay?

              Paul nods--I promise. Del rises, steps to Paul.

                                  DEL
                        Here, take him.

              Del lifts his hand. Mr. Jingles steps off onto Paul's
              shoulder with no hesitation. Gently:

                                  PAUL
                        Del. I can't have a mouse on my
                        shoulder while...you know.

                                  COFFEY
                        I'll take him, boss. Jus' for now.
                        If Del don' mind.

                                  DEL
                        Yeah, you take 'im, John. Take him
                        til' dis foolishment done--bien!
                               (to Paul and Brutal)
                        After, you take him down to
                        Florida? To dat Mouseville?

                                  BRUTAL
                        We'll do it together, most likely.
                        Maybe take a little vacation time.

              Paul moves to Coffey's cell. The mouse skitters off Paul's
              shoulder onto Coffey's hand.

                                  DEL
                        People pay a dime apiece to see
                        him. Two cents for the kiddies.
                        Ain't dat right, Boss Howell?

                                  BRUTAL
                        That's right, Del.

                                  DEL
                        You a good man, Boss Howell. You
                        too, Boss Edgecomb. Wish I could'a
                        met you bot' someplace else.

              Del gives Mr. Jingles one last look, starts to cry.

                                  DEL
                        Au revoir, mon ami. Je t'aime, mon
                        petit.

              And they start to walk the Mile...

              EXECUTION CHAMBER

              Sweltering in the damp heat. Rain is pissing down, drumming
              the tin roof. People glance up uneasily as THUNDER BOOMS. A
              FAT LADY is staring grimly at the electric chair.

                                  FAT LADY
                        Hope he's good and scared. Hope he
                        knows the fires are stoked, and
                        that Satan's imps are waiting.

              ANGLE ON DOOR

              Del enters, horrified to see Percy waiting at Old Sparky.
              Paul gives Del's arm a reassuring squeeze, leads him
              forward...

              IN A TIGHT SERIES OF SHOTS:

              The clamps are applied. The straps are drawn tight.

                                  PERCY
                        Roll on one.

              The lights brighten on a RISING HUM. Witnesses look up.

              ON THE MILE

              Coffey looks up as the overheads flare hotter and hotter,
              whispers to the mouse in his hands:

                                  COFFEY
                        You be still, Mr. Jingles. You be
                        so quiet and so still.

              RESUME EXECUTION CHAMBER

                                  PERCY
                        Eduard Delacroix, you have been
                        condemned to die by a jury of your
                        peers, sentence imposed by a judge
                        in good standing in this state.
                        You have anything to say before
                        sentence is carried out?

              Del tries to speak. Doesn't quite manage the first time.
              Licks his lips and tries again.

                                  DEL
                        I sorry for what I do. I give
                        anything to take it back, but I
                        can't. God have mercy on me.
                               (whispers to Paul)
                        Don' forget 'bout Mouseville.

              Paul and Brutal nod--and are stunned as:

                                  PERCY
                        No such place. That's just a fairy
                        tale these guys told you to keep
                        you quiet. Just thought you should
                        know, faggot.

              The stricken look in Del's eyes tells us a part of him had
              known all along. Paul and Brutal would both like to deck
              Percy right about now, and he knows it--he gives them a "what
              are you gonna do about it" smile.

              Nothing they can do. Paul nods to Harry, who takes the black
              mask from the back of the chair and rolls it down over Del's
              head, leaving the top of his shaved head exposed.

              PERCY

              takes the sponge and bends down to the bucket of brine. The
              other don't see it, but we do:

              Percy only pretends to dip the sponge and soak it. It never
              touches the water. He straightens up and places the sponge
              atop Delacroix's head, hiding it with his hands.

              The cap is lowered. Paul and the others haven't yet realized
              what's happened. THUNDER BOOMS and LIGHTNING CRASHES as Percy
              hides a smile, steps back to address the condemned:

                                  PERCY
                        Electricity shall now be passed
                        through your body until you are
                        dead, in accordance with state
                        law. God have mercy on your soul.

              TIGHT ON PAUL

              as realization starts to dawn. He stares at the bucket, then
              across the floor to Delacroix, coming to terms with the
              evidence of his eyes--there's no water on the floor or
              dripping down the sides of Del's neck.

              Paul's eyes widen. A stunned beat of horror. He starts to
              open his mouth to scream "NO!", but Percy beats him to it
              with:

                                  PERCY
                        Roll on two.

              Van Hay flicks the switch. WHAM. The electricity hits home
              and Del rocks forward, riding the current.

              Then things start to go horribly wrong.

              The HUMMING loses its steadiness and starts to waver with a
              CRACKLING SOUND. Tendrils of smoke begin curling from under
              the cap, a mixture of burning hair and sponge. Brutal shoots
              Paul a horrified look. Paul responds with a harsh whisper:

                                  PAUL
                        It's dry!

              Delacroix begins twisting and jittering in the chair, his
              masked face snapping violently from side to side, his legs
              pistoning up and down in his restraints.

              There's a MUFFLED POP from under the cap, like a pine knot
              exploding in a hot fire. Smoke starts coming through the
              fabric of the mask, puffing upward. Del is being cooked
              alive. Paul spins to the partition, hollering--

                                  PAUL
                        JACK!

              --but Brutal grabs his arm, whispers fiercely:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Don't you tell him to stop. Don't
                        you do it. It's too late for that.

              Paul turns back, helpless. The other guards are trading wild
              looks, unable to believe what's happening. Even Percy looks
              aghast--he was expecting something, but not this.

              Del begins SCREAMING--the wild, hysterical sound of an animal
              being shredded alive in a hay baler. The HUMMING goes uneven
              and ragged, the lights rising and falling...

              ON THE MILE

              ...as Del's screams rise and fall with them, echoing up the
              corridor. Coffey's shaking and screaming too, as if feeling
              Del's pain. Mr. Jingles squirms out of his grasp and goes
              squeaking in terror toward the restraint room door...

                                  BILLY
                        HE'S COOKIN' NOW! THEY COOKIN' HIM
                        GOOD! NEAR ABOUT DONE, I RECKON!

              RESUME EXECUTION CHAMBER

              Wrong. Del's nowhere near about done. He's slamming back and
              forth in the chair hard enough to shake the platform,
              twisting hard against the leather restraints. We hear BONES
              BREAKING. A WOMAN'S SCREAMS. Witnesses start rising to their
              feet:

                                  WITNESSES
                        What the hell's happening to
                        him?...Are those clamps going to
                        hold?...Christ, the smell!...Is
                        this normal?

              The mask bursts into flame on Delacroix's face. Van Hay
              hollers through the wire mesh, horrified:

                                  VAN HAY
                        SHOULD I KILL THE JUICE?

                                  PAUL
                        NO! ROLL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, ROLL!

              Harry scoops up the bucket of water to throw it.

                                  PAUL
                        No water! No water! You crazy?

              Harry backs off with a look of dazed understanding--you don't
              throw water on a man getting juiced. Right. He drops the
              bucket, races to get the chemical fire extinguisher instead.

              The flaming mask peels away, revealing Del's charring face.
              His eyeballs are misshapen globs of burning white jelly blown
              out of their sockets. The ATTENDING DOCTOR faints dead away.

              Pandemonium now in the room. People shouting and hurrying to
              exit, chairs falling over, women screaming:

                                  FAT LADY
                        Stop it, stop it, oh can't you see
                        he's had enough?

              Hal grabs Paul by the shoulder, spins him around.

                                  HAL
                        Why don't you shut it down?

                                  PAUL
                        He's still alive! You want me to
                        shut down while he's still alive?

              Hal is horrified at the thought. Del is jittering and
              screaming, rocking from side to side, smoke pouring from his
              nostrils and mouth, his tongue sizzling purple-black.

              The witnesses are crowding and shoving to get out, but the
              back door is locked. All they can do is cluster there.

              Paul sees Percy with his head turned away. He grabs him,
              forces his head around.

                                  PAUL
                        You watch, you son of a bitch!

              Harry steps up, the extinguisher in his hands. Waiting. Del
              finally slumps over. He still vibrating, but now it's just
              the effect of current flowing through his body.

                                  PAUL
                        Kill it!

              Van Hay kills the current. The HUMMING DIES. Brutal grabs the
              extinguisher from Harry, shoves it into Percy's hands.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You do it. You're running the
                        show, ain't you?

              Percy, sick and dazed, aims the extinguisher and hoses the
              smoking corpse. Hal is near the back, calming the crowd:

                                  HAL
                        It's all right, folks, it's all
                        under control. Just a power surge
                        from the storm, that's all,
                        nothing to worry about...

                                  PAUL
                        Dean, get doc's stethoscope.

              Dean drops to the doctor's bag, digs through it, hands up the
              stethoscope. Paul plugs them into his ears. People are
              moaning and sobbing at the back of the room:

                                  MAN
                        Oh my God! Is it always like this?
                        Why didn't somebody tell me? I
                        never would have come!

              Paul wipes some foam away from Delacroix's chest, places the
              stethoscope pad to the raw flesh. He nods to Brutal--it's
              over.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              Paul and the others bring the stretcher down, lay the corpse
              on the gurney. Percy starts stammering excuses:

                                  PERCY
                        I didn't know the sponge was
                        supposed to be wet--

              Brutal hauls off and slugs him. A scuffle ensues as the
              others grab Brutal and pull him off.

                                  PAUL
                        Brutal, no!

                                  BRUTAL
                        What do you mean, no? How can you
                        say no? You saw what he did!

                                  PAUL
                        Delacroix's dead, nothing can
                        change that, and Percy's not worth
                        it!

                                  BRUTAL
                        So he just gets away with it? Is
                        that how it works?

              Hal comes lunging down the stairs, furious:

                                  HAL
                        What the fuck was that? Jesus
                        Christ, three witnesses puked all
                        over the floor up there! And the
                        smell! I got Van Hay to open both
                        doors, but that smell won't come
                        out for five damn years, that's
                        what I'm betting! And that asshole
                        Wharton is singing about it! I can
                        hear him!

                                  PAUL
                               (quietly)
                        Can he carry a tune, Hal?

              This pulls the plug on the moment--Hal snorts, triggering
              laughter among the men, a wild release of tension and fear.
              Everybody starts feeling a bit saner again as it dies down:

                                  HAL
                        Okay, boys. Okay. Now what the
                        hell happened?

              All eyes go to Percy. Hal turns, sees Percy's bloody lip.

                                  HAL
                        Percy? Something to say?

                                  PERCY
                        I didn't know the sponge was
                        supposed to be wet.

              Beat. A look of utter contempt from Hal.

                                  HAL
                        How many years you spend pissing
                        on the toilet seat before somebody
                        told you to put it up?

                                  PAUL
                        Percy fucked up, Hal. Pure and
                        simple.

                                  HAL
                        Is that your official position?

                                  PAUL
                        Don't you think it should be?

              Hal considers it, nods.

                                  PAUL
                        He'll be putting in a transfer
                        request to Briar Ridge tomorrow.
                        Moving on to bigger and better
                        things. Isn't that right, Percy?

              Percy nods. Hal steps close, gives him a tight, icy smile.

                                  HAL
                        You're a little asshole, and I
                        don't like you a bit.
                               (off Percy's look)
                        Have that transfer request on my
                        desk first thing.

              Hal heads back up the stairs. Brutal shoves Percy aside and
              wheels Delacroix's body down the tunnel.

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Paul returns to find Wild Bill making up a song in his cell:

                                  BILLY
                               (singing)
                        Barbecue! Me and you! Stinky,
                        pinky, phew-phew-phew! Weren't
                        Billy or Jilly or Hilly or Roy--it
                        was a French-fried faggot named
                        Delacroix!

                                  PAUL
                        You're about ten seconds away from
                        spending the rest of your life in
                        the padded room.

              Billy falls silent. Paul continues down the Mile to Coffey's
              cell. Coffey's on his bunk, face streaked with tears. He
              wipes his eyes with the heels of his hands like an exhausted
              child.

                                  COFFEY
                        Poor Del. Poor old Del.

                                  PAUL
                        Yes. Poor old Del. John, are you
                        okay?

                                  COFFEY
                        I could feel it from here.

                                  PAUL
                        What do you mean? You could hear
                        it? Is that what you mean?

                                  COFFEY
                        He's out of it now, though. He's
                        the lucky one. No matter how it
                        happened, Del's the lucky one.

              Paul realizes he won't get a coherent answer.

                                  PAUL
                        Where's Mr. Jingles?

                                  COFFEY
                               (points vaguely)
                        Ran down there. Don't think he'll
                        be back.
                               (beat)
                        Awful tired now, boss. Dog tired.

              Coffey lays down, turns to face the wall.

                                  PAUL
                        Me too, John. Me too.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

              Paul enters in darkness, hangs his hat. He drifts into the
              kitchen, clicks on the radio. SOFT MUSIC BEGINS: Gene Austin
              singing "Did You Ever See A Dream Walking?"

              He pours a drink at the kitchen table, takes a sip, lays the
              glass down. Jan sleepily appears from the darkness behind
              him, entering the kitchen. He realizes she's there, glances
              back.

              She can sense the weight on his soul. She comes to him, folds
              his head into her arms. They stand that way, he drawing
              strength and she giving it, as the music plays on...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              SEQUENCE WITH MUSIC:

              INT. CHURCH - MORNING

              CAMERA TRACKS the pews to find Paul and Jan seated together
              in the congregation, voices raised in hymn...

              EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING

              Paul's Model T comes sputtering up the road. He and Jan are
              taking a drive, still in their Sunday best...

              EXT. HAL'S HOUSE - MORNING

              Paul and Jan wait at the front door. Jan holds a baking dish.

                                  PAUL
                        I hate this.

                                  JAN
                        I know.

              The door opens. Hal, looking tired, ushers them inside...

              EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING

              ...and they walk outside to find MELINDA MOORES sitting in
              the sun, frail and wasted, a blanket on her knees. She'd be
              beautiful if not for the cancer killing her.

              Paul is shocked at her appearance, hides it as best as he
              can. Jan covers this for him--she drops to Melinda's side
              with a warm smile and a kiss, takes the woman's frail hands
              in hers.

              Paul catches Jan's eye. The look he gives her says it all--I
              don't know what I'd do without you...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and we find Paul and Hal talking quietly over beers while
              the women visit b.g.:

                                  HAL
                        She's having one of her good days.
                        I thank God for that.

                                  PAUL
                        What a bad day?

                                  HAL
                               (beat)
                        Sometimes she's...not herself
                        anymore. She swears.

                                  PAUL
                        Swears.

                                  HAL
                        It just pops out, the most awful
                        language you can imagine. She
                        doesn't even know she's doing it.
                        I didn't know she'd ever heard
                        words like that...and to hear her
                        say them in her sweet voice...
                               (gazes off)
                        I'm glad she's having a good day,
                        Paul. I'm glad for you and Jan.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

              Paul is wide awake, staring at the dark. Jan can sense him
              brooding. She rolls over sleepily.

                                  JAN
                        Honey? If you don't say what's on
                        your mind, I'm afraid I'll have to
                        smother you with a pillow.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm thinking I love you. I'm
                        thinking I don't know what I'd do
                        if you were gone.

                                  JAN
                        Oh.

                                  PAUL
                               (beat)
                        I'm also thinking I'd like to have
                        the boys over tomorrow.

              Off Jan's look, we

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. DINING ROOM- DAY

              Brutal, Harry, and Dean are seated at the table with Paul and
              Jan. Serving plates are being passes, everybody digging in:

                                  THE MEN
                               (various, ad-lib)
                        Ma'am, you sure know how to fry up
                        some fine chicken...Brutal, don't
                        hog the taters now...Try that corn
                        yet? It's something special...

              Paul softly interjects:

                                  PAUL
                        You saw what he did with the mouse.

              This stops everybody cold. Dean puts his chicken down, wipes
              his hands. Looks are traded in the silence.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I could'a gone the rest of the day
                        without you bringing that up.

                                  DEAN
                        I could'a gone the rest of the
                        year.

                                  PAUL
                        He did it to me too. He put his
                        hands on me and took my bladder
                        infection away.

              The men absorb this. Brutal glances to Jan.

                                  JAN
                        When he came home, he was...all
                        better.

                                  DEAN
                        You're talking about an authentic
                        healing. A praise-Jesus miracle.

                                  PAUL
                        I am.

                                  BRUTAL
                        If you say it, I accept it. But
                        what's it got to do with us?

              Jan looks to Paul, realization starting to dawn:

                                  JAN
                        Melinda? Oh, Paul...

                                  BRUTAL
                        Melinda? Melinda Moores?

              Paul nods--that's who we're talking about.

                                  JAN
                        You really think you can help her?

                                  PAUL
                        It's not a bladder infection, or
                        even a busted-up mouse. But there
                        might be a chance.

                                  HARRY
                        Hold on now. You're talking about
                        our jobs. Sneak a sick woman onto
                        a cellblock?

                                  PAUL
                        Hal would never allow that. You
                        know him, he wouldn't believe
                        something unless it fell on him.

                                  BRUTAL
                        So you're talking about taking
                        John Coffey to her. That's more
                        than just our jobs, Paul.

                                  DEAN
                        Damn right. That's prison time if
                        we get caught.

                                  HARRY
                        Let's not discuss this like it's
                        even an option. Brutal, help me
                        out here...

              Brutal lets out a deep breath, considering. He looks to Paul.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I'm sure she's a fine woman...

                                  JAN
                        The finest.

                                  PAUL
                        What's happening to her is an
                        offense, Brutal. To the eyes and
                        the ears and the heart.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I have no doubt. But we don't know
                        her like you and Jan do...do we?

                                  PAUL
                        That's why it's a lot to ask.

                                  HARRY
                        It is. Let's not forget Coffey's
                        a murderer. What if he escapes?
                        I'd hate losing my job or going to
                        prison, but I'd hate having a dead
                        child on my conscience even more.

                                  PAUL
                        I don't think that'll happen...
                               (beat, softly)
                        ...in fact, I don't think he did
                        it at all.

              The men are stunned by this. Off their looks:

                                  PAUL
                        I just can't see God putting a
                        gift like that in the hands of a
                        man who would kill a child.

                                  DEAN
                        Well, that's a tender notion, but
                        the man's on death row for the
                        crime. Plus, he's huge. If he
                        tried to get away, it'd take a lot
                        of bullets to stop him.

                                  BRUTAL
                        We'd all have shotguns in addition
                        to sidearms. I'd insist on that.
                               (to Paul)
                        He tried anything, we'd have to
                        take him down. You understand.

                                  PAUL
                        I understand.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (beat)
                        So. Tell us what you had in mind.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                                    "Night Journey"

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. INFIRMARY BUILDING/DISPENSARY - NIGHT

              A FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays across a glass cabinet, scanning the
              contents. The beam pauses. A hand enters frame, unlocks the
              cabinet, pulls out a bottle of morphine tablets...

              ...and WE ANGLE TO Brutal as he shakes half a dozen pills
              onto his palm, pockets them, replaces the bottle on the
              shelf. He turns and slips five bucks to a NIGHTSHIFT ORDERLY.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I was never here.

                                  ORDERLY
                        Shit, for five bucks, you was
                        never nowhere.

              INT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              A MORPHINE PILL is being crushed to powder on the stainless
              steel gurney. TILT UP to Paul crushing the pills. Brutal
              carefully scrapes the powder onto a small sheet of paper...

              INT. PAUL'S INNER OFFICE - NIGHT

              Percy is parked in Paul's chair with his feet up, reading a
              book titled: "CARING FOR MENTAL PATIENTS."

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Harry and Dean are playing cards at the duty desk, tension
              thick, cards slapping softly as the seconds tick by. Paul and
              Brutal finally show up toting bottles of RC cola:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Fellas thirsty? Fresh out of the
                        icebox.

                                  DEAN
                        Oh, thanks. That's swell.

                                  HARRY
                        Yeah, hot in here.

              They begin popping the caps off, swigging cola. The sound of
              it brings Billy to his bars.

                                  BILLY
                        Hey. Hey, I'm'a get some too.

                                  BRUTAL
                        My ass you get some too.

                                  PAUL
                        You think you deserve any?

                                  HARRY
                               (checks a clipboard)
                        Day report says he's been okay.

                                  BILLY
                        Hell, yes, I been behaved. C'mon,
                        now, don't be stingy hogs.

              Paul shrugs to Brutal--why not? Brutal pops the top off a
              bottle, passes it to Paul. Paul grabs a tin cup, sets it on
              the desk...and we see it contains the morphine powder. He
              pours the cola, swirls it around...

              ANGLE THROUGH COFFEY'S BARS

              ...as Coffey looks up, sensing something happening. He peers
              up the Mile as Paul walks to:

              BILLY'S CELL

              Billy reaches for the cup, but Paul keeps it out of reach.

                                  PAUL
                        You gonna stay behaved?

                                  BILLY
                        C'mon, you clunk, gimme that.

                                  PAUL
                        You promise me, or I'll drink it
                        myself right here in front of you.

                                  BILLY
                        C'mon now, don't be that way. I be
                        good.

              Paul lets him take the cup. Billy knocks it back, draining it
              in three huge swallows. He lets out an awesome belch.

                                  PAUL
                        Cup.

                                  BILLY
                        We'll break out the fire hose and
                        take it anyway. And you will have
                        drunk your last R.C. cola. Unless
                        they serve 'em down in hell.

              Billy's smile fades. He hands the cup through the bars. Paul
              takes it, turns and heads back to--

              THE DUTY DESK

              --where Brutal, Harry, and Dean have been watching the entire
              exchange with their hearts in their throats...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and we find Billy staring glassy-eyed at the ceiling. He
              keels over on his bunk. ANGLE to Paul and Brutal stepping to
              the bars with Harry and Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        Anybody wants to back out, now's
                        the time. After this, there's no
                        turning back.
                               (off their looks)
                        So? We gonna do this?

              A voice comes softly from down the way:

                                  COFFEY
                        Sure. I'd like to take a ride.

              Their heads come slowly around, staring at Coffey in shock.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (to Paul)
                        Guess were all in.

              INT. PAUL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

              Percy looks up from his book as the door opens. Paul enters
              with Brutal and Harry, ominously hemming the desk.

                                  PERCY
                        What is this?

              Paul pulls the canvas straitjacket from behind his back.

                                  PAUL
                        Payback.

              Percy jumps up and tries to the execution chamber, but Harry
              grabs him, spins him back. A wild scuffle ensues as:

                                  PERCY
                        Let go of me! Let go!

                                  PAUL
                        Settle down, Percy!

              Percy tries to jerk away, crashes into the desk. The book he
              was reading falls to the floor--

              --and a "Tijuana Bible" is revealed within the pages. It's a
              pornographic cartoon book of the type popular in the '30's,
              featuring crude drawings of famous cartoon characters or
              movie stars engaged in outlandish sexual acts. This one has
              Olive Oyl getting it doggy-style from Popeye. The word
              balloon over his head features his famous laugh: "Uk-uk-uk-
              uk!"

                                  BRUTAL
                        Oooo, Poicy! What would your
                        mother say?

                                  PERCY
                        Let go, you ignoramus! I know
                        people! Big people!

                                  PAUL
                        So you've said. C'mon, stick out
                        your arms like a good boy.

                                  PERCY
                        I won't. And you can't make me.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You're dead wrong about that, you
                        know.

              Brutal grabs Percy by the ears, twisting hard. Percy lets out
              a shriek--not just of pain, but a dismayed understanding that
              he's not going to bluster his way out of this one.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You gonna put your arms up? I'll
                        rip your ears off. Use 'em for tea
                        caddies. You know I will.

                                  PAUL
                        The man's ripping your ears off,
                        Percy. I'd do as he says.

              Percy jerks his arms up before him. They get the straitjacket
              on him within seconds. Percy turns to Paul on the verge of
              tears. Softly:

                                  PERCY
                        Please, Paul. Don't put me in with
                        Wild Bill. Please.

                                  PAUL
                        You would think that.

              Paul gives him a hard, angry shove...

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              ...and they bring him down the Mile to the restraint room
              door. Brutal takes Percy's holster and baton.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You'll get 'em back, don't worry.

                                  PERCY
                        That's more than I can say about
                        your jobs. All your jobs! You
                        can't do this to me! You can't!

              Paul steps forward with a roll of strapping tape.

                                  PAUL
                        Let you in on a little secret. We
                        can and we are.

              He slaps the tape over Percy's mouth and shoves him back into
              the restraint room. Percy stands breathing heavily through
              his nose, making muffled mmmmph-mmmph! sounds under the tape.

                                  PAUL
                        You're going to have a few hours
                        of quiet time now, so you can
                        reflect on what you did to Del.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (grins)
                        If you get lonely, think about
                        Olive Oyl...
                               (thrusting his hips)
                        ...uk-uk-uk-uk!

              And they slam the door, shutting Percy into darkness.

              A WALL-MOUNTED GUN SAFE

              is unlocked, shotguns pulled out. The men load up, heading
              down the Mile as:

                                  PAUL
                        One more time--what do you say if
                        somebody comes by?

                                  DEAN
                        Coffey got upset, so we put him in
                        the restraint room. They hear any
                        noise, they'll think it's him.

              They come to Coffey's cell.

                                  COFFEY
                        We goan for the ride now?

                                  PAUL
                        That's right.

              The cell is unlocked. Coffey emerges. Paul motions them
              along, still grilling Dean:

                                  PAUL
                        What about us?

                                  DEAN
                        You're over in Admin, going over
                        Del's file. Brutal and Harry are
                        in the laundry doing their wash--

              A skinny white arm suddenly shoots out from Wild Bill's cell
              and grabs Coffey by the wrist. The men gasp, shocked to see
              Billy on his feet, grinning and weaving like a punch-drunk.

              Coffey's reaction is beyond simple surprise; he's actually
              trembling at Billy's touch as if some electrical circuit were
              engaged. His eyes are wide and horrified, as if he'd just put
              his hand in a basket full of snakes. He tries to pull away,
              but Billy has him tight, that mysterious circuit blazing.

                                  BILLY
                               (slurring wildly)
                        Where you fink you're goin'?

              Coffey responds softly, with utmost horror:

                                  COFFEY
                        You're a bad man.

                                  BILLY
                        S'right, nigger. Bad as you'd want.

              Paul plucks Billy's hand off Coffey's arm--and Coffey
              flinches back as the circuit is broken.

                                  BILLY
                        Whooeee. Whole room's spinning.
                        Like I'm shit-ass drunk. I have me
                        some shine or what?

              He turns and staggers back to his bunk, muttering all the way:

                                  BILLY
                        Niggers oughtta have they own
                        'lectric chair. White man oughtn't
                        havta sit in no nigger 'lectric
                        chair, nossir...

              He goes face-first onto his bunk. Coffey is still staring.

                                  COFFEY
                        He's a bad man.

              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

              Coffey is brought in...and freezes in horror at the sight of
              Old Sparky. A whisper:

                                  COFFEY
                        They're still in there. Pieces of
                        them, still in there. I hear them
                        screaming.

              All eyes go to the electric chair. It sits shrouded in shadow
              like an ominous throne. Never before has this place felt so
              haunted to the men. It makes the hairs on the neck stand up.

                                  PAUL
                        John, come along! Right now,
                        y'hear? C'mon! Toward that door!

              Coffey finally responds, pulling away...

              INT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              ...and they come down the steps. They realize Coffey will
              have to stoop all the way down the tunnel. Paul pats the
              gurney.

                                  PAUL
                        Lie down on this.
                               (off Coffey's look)
                        It'll be easier for you and no
                        harder for us.

              Coffey eases carefully onto the gurney, lying on his back.
              His knees hang over the edge and his toes touch the ground,
              but it works. They push him along, traversing the pools of
              light.

              Coffey actually starts to smile. He reaches out his arms,
              fingertips touching the tunnel walls as they go by.

                                  COFFEY
                        Say. This is fun.

              EXT. PRISON WALL - NIGHT

              A massive iron door SQUEALS open onto a little-used fenced
              enclosure. Paul and the others bring Coffey up from the
              tunnel below, emerging into the night. Coffey's breath
              catches as he gazes wondrously up at the stars, pointing:

                                  COFFEY
                        Look, boss! It's Cassie, the lady
                        in the rocking chair!

                                  PAUL
                        Shhh. John, you have to be quiet
                        now.

                                  COFFEY
                               (whispering)
                        You see her? You see the lady?

                                  BRUTAL
                        We see her, John.

              Harry goes first, hugging the shadows as he pulls his keys to
              unlock the gate...

              WIDE SHOT OF PRISON

              ...while TOWER GUARDS huddle in their enclosure atop the
              walls. An occasional SPOTLIGHT cuts the darkness. FIREFLIES
              dance in the fields and trees as far as the eye can see.

              Four dark figures detach from the shadows, hurrying across
              the lonely country road into the fields on the far side...

              EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

              Coffey's hand scoops up some fallen leaves. TILT UP to his
              face as he crunches them under his nose, inhaling their smell.

              He see the guards throwing him anxious looks. He misreads
              this, holds out his hand so they can smell too. They do it,
              just to make him happy.

                                  PAUL
                        C'mon, big boy, keep moving.

              A FEW FIREFLIES come winking through frame as the group
              presses on...

              ANOTHER AREA/WOODS

              The trees are growing sparser, opening onto fields. MORE
              FIREFLIES are flitting into view, trailing in their wake...

                                  BRUTAL
                        How far is it?

                                  HARRY
                        Just up ahead...

              Harry brings them to a thicket of trees. They start removing
              branches and boughs, uncovering a battered old FARMALL TRUCK
              hidden in the brush.

              The men pause. Even more fireflies are swirling around them,
              growing in number. It's getting downright weird.

              Coffey laughs softly, drawing their attention. A childlike
              smile has utterly transformed his face. He raises his hand,
              letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his fingers.

                                  COFFEY
                        Hey there, little firefly. Where's
                        Mrs. Firefly this evening?

              Another firefly joins the first, both now dancing and
              blinking around his fingers. Coffey laughs again.

                                  COFFEY
                        Oh, there you is. You come out to
                        play too?

              The men stand gaping. The fireflies are flitting to Coffey as
              if to a beacon. He waves his hands slowly, fireflies blinking
              and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust.

              They begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny glowing
              planet orbiting a sun, their light kicking a mellow sheen off
              his ebony skin. Coffey's eyes meet Paul's.

                                  PAUL
                        They seem...drawn to you.

                                  COFFEY
                        I love 'em, is why. They don't
                        think no hurtful thoughts. They's
                        just happy to be. Happy little
                        lightning bugs...

              The men don't know whether to be enchanted or terrified.
              Harry gives Paul a look--can we go? Please?

                                  PAUL
                        C'mon, big boy. Upsy-daisy.

              Coffey clambers up on the stakebed. Paul and Brutal join him.
              Harry gets in behind the wheel, jabs the starter button...

              ON THE STAKEBED

              ...while Coffey sits with his back to the cab.

                                  PAUL
                        John? Do you know where we're
                        taking you?

                                  COFFEY
                        Help a lady?

                                  PAUL
                        That's right. Help a lady. But how
                        did you know?

                                  COFFEY
                        Dunno. Tell the truth, boss, I
                        don't know much'a anything. Never
                        have.

              The truck pulls out. Coffey waves as the fireflies get left
              behind, dwindling away like stars.

                                  COFFEY
                        Bye, fireflies. Bye.

              WIDE ANGLE OF COUNTRYSIDE

              The truck rumbles from the fields onto a dirt road, countless
              fireflies swirling in its wake...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              EXT. MOORES HOUSE - NIGHT

              Headlights come over the rise. The truck appears, rumbling
              down toward the house. The world is isolated and still.

              IN THE TRUCK CAB

              Harry stops and cuts the engine, leaving the headlights on.
              Silence now, save for the trilling of crickets.

              IN THE STAKEBED

              Paul and Brutal both look terrified now that they're actually
              here. An urgent whisper:

                                  BRUTAL
                        We can still turn back.

              Paul hesitates, wanting to do just that, but:

                                  COFFEY
                        Boss, look. Someone's up.

              Lights are coming on inside the house. Coffey rises and steps
              down from the truck, pulling Paul along. Brutal follows them.

                                  BRUTAL
                        This is a mistake. Christ, Paul,
                        what were we thinking?

                                  PAUL
                        Too late now. Harry, keep John
                        here until we call you.

              Paul and Brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside
              the house keep clicking on. The last one finally comes on
              over the stoop, the front door opens a crack...and the twin
              barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night.

                                  HAL
                        Who the hell goes there at two-
                        thirty in the goddamn morning?

                                  PAUL
                        Hal, it's us! It's Paul and
                        Brutal--it's us!

              The door swings wider, revealing Hal's face gaunt and haggard
              in the yellow porch light, stunned to see them:

                                  HAL
                        Paul, what are you doing here at
                        this hour? Jesus, it's not a
                        lockdown, is it? Or a riot?

                                  PAUL
                        Hal, God's sakes, take your finger
                        off the trigger...

              Hal doesn't, aiming past them at the truck in the yard.

                                  HAL
                        Are you hostages? Who's out there?
                        Who's by that truck?

              Coffey steps into the glare of headlights with Harry tugging
              on his arm, trying to hold him back. Hal cocks both hammers.

                                  HAL
                        John Coffey! Halt! Halt right
                        there or I shoot!

              His aim wavers as a woman's voice comes from upstairs:

                                  MELINDA (O.S.)
                        Hal? Who are you talking to, you
                        fucking cocksucker?

              A frozen moment. Hal mortified. Paul gives him a look--is
              that Melinda?

              Hal's shotgun shifts back to Coffey--but Paul steps in front
              of the muzzle.

                                  PAUL
                        No one's hurt. We're here to help.

                                  HAL
                        Help what? I don't understand. Is
                        this a prison break?

                                  PAUL
                        I can't explain what it is. You
                        just have to trust me.

              Coffey comes up the steps, brushes Paul aside, stops before
              the warden. Hal blinks, his thoughts suddenly fuzzy--it's
              that benign hypnotic effect Coffey has.

                                  HAL
                        What do you...want?

                                  MELINDA
                        Hal! Make them go away! No
                        salesmen in the middle of the
                        night! No Fuller brushes! No
                        French knickers with come in the
                        crotch! Tell them to take a flying
                        fuck in a rolling d...d...

              We hear the sound of GLASS BREAKING, then she begins to sob.

                                  COFFEY
                               (a whisper)
                        Just to help. Just to help, boss,
                        that's all.

                                  HAL
                        You can't. No one can.

              Coffey pulls the shotgun gently from Hal's grasp, hands it to
              Paul. Coffey moves past Hal into the house...

              INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

              ...and comes up the hallway toward the stairs.

                                  HAL
                        Don't you go up there! Don't you
                        do it!

                                  COFFEY
                        Boss, you just be quiet now and
                        let me be.

              Coffey mounts the stairs with the others at his heels,
              heading up toward that quavering voice:

                                  MELINDA (O.S.)
                        Stay out of here! Whoever you are,
                        just stay out! I'm not dressed for
                        visitors, you rat's asshole!

              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

              Coffey enters, trailed by the others. Paul pauses, horrified.

              The woman propped in bed barely resembles Melinda Moores
              anymore--she looks made up like a Halloween witch, her livid
              skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles, one corner of her
              mouth twisted. Yellowish bile stains her chin and the front
              of her nightgown. Her hair has gone white and straw-like, her
              eyes glowering at Coffey with lively, irrational interest:

                                  MELINDA
                        Oh, so big! Pull down your pants!
                        Let's have a look!

              Hal groans with despair. Coffey just stands there for a
              moment, watching her from a distance, then approaches the
              bed...

                                  MELINDA
                        Don't come near me, pigfucker.

              ...but as he draws closer, a change occurs. Her features
              soften, her eyes become more sane and aware.

                                  MELINDA
                        Why do you have so many scars? Who
                        hurt you so badly?

                                  COFFEY
                        Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

              Coffey sits on the edge of the bed. The lights seem to flare
              hotter and brighter. Tears are forming in Melinda's eyes.

                                  MELINDA
                        What's your name?

                                  COFFEY
                        John Coffey, ma'am. Like the
                        drink, only not spelt the same.

              She lays back, staring at him with shining fascination. The
              world seems to be slowing down, growing very still indeed...

              ...and he starts bending slowly toward her.

                                  COFFEY
                        Ma'am?

                                  MELINDA
                        Yes, John Coffey?

                                  COFFEY
                        I see it. I see it.

              He comes closer...closer still...

                                  COFFEY
                        You be still now. You be so quiet
                        and so still.

              He brushes her forehead with his lips...the gentlest whisper
              of a kiss...then moves his mouth down to hers. For a moment
              we can see one of her eyes staring past him, filling with an
              expression of surprise...

              ...and then her face is lost to view as Coffey puts his lips
              on hers. We hear a soft whistling sound as he begins inhaling
              the air deeply from her lungs. Something hot and glowing
              starts passing between them, drawn on his breath...

              The men watch. The house seems to shudder in that moment, as
              if the entire world has shifted an inch to the right...

              DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR

              ...and the grandfather clock stops ticking, the pendulum
              stopping dead, the glass face cracking neatly up the center...

              BEDROOM

              ...and a windowpane cracks. Then another. A picture falls off
              the wall. A lightbulb bursts, showering glass.

              Paul smells smoke, realizes the fringed coverlet of the bed
              has caught fire. Moving like a man in a dream, he reaches for
              the waterglass on the nightstand, douses the flames.

              Coffey keeps kissing Melinda in that deep and mysterious way,
              inhaling and inhaling, her hand held in his like a tiny white
              bird. For a moment we actually hear something screaming, as
              if some willful imp were being extracted by force...

              ...and then it's over. Coffey raises his head, revealing:

              Melinda's beautiful face. Her mouth no longer droops. Color
              is coming back to her hair. Her skin is shining with life.

              Coffey regards her raptly for a moment or two, then starts
              coughing violently.

              He turns away and drops to his knees, hacking like a man in
              the last stages of tuberculosis.

              Paul and his men are expecting Coffey to spit out the "bugs",
              but he doesn't--he just keeps coughing, deep and hard, barely
              finding time to snatch in the next breath of air.

              Hal goes to his wife, beyond stunned, sits at her side. She
              looks back at him with amazement, her face like a dirty
              mirror that's been suddenly wiped clean.

              John's coughing grows even worse. Brutal drops to his side
              and slaps his broad, spasming back.

                                  BRUTAL
                        John! Sick it up! Cough 'em out
                        like you done before!

              Coffey just keeps retching, eyes watering from the strain,
              spit flying from his mouth.

                                  BRUTAL
                        He's choking! Whatever he sucked
                        out of her, he's choking on it!

              Paul starts toward them. Coffey crawls away, pressing himself
              into a corner with his face against the wallpaper. He's still
              making gruesome deep hacking sounds, but getting it under
              control. He weakly waves Paul off--let me be.

              Paul looks to the bed. Hal sits with Melinda, stroking her
              brow. Color is blooming in her cheeks even as we watch.

                                  MELINDA
                        How did I get here? We were going
                        to the hospital in Indianola,
                        weren't we? We stopped and you
                        bought me a packet of posies...

                                  HAL
                        Shhh. It doesn't matter. It
                        doesn't matter anymore.

                                  MELINDA
                        Did I have the X-ray? Did I

                                  PAUL
                        Yes.

              They both look at him.

                                  PAUL
                        It was clear. There was no tumor.

              Hal bursts into tears. Melinda sits up, comforting him. Her
              eyes are drawn to the corner.

                                  MELINDA
                        Who is that man?

              Coffey is struggling to rise. Brutal does his best to help.

                                  PAUL
                        John? Can you turn around? Can you
                        turn around and see this lady?

              Coffey turns. His face is ashen gray, seriously ill.

                                  MELINDA
                        What's your name?

                                  COFFEY
                        John Coffey, ma'am.

                                  MELINDA
                        Like the drink, only not spelled
                        the same.

                                  COFFEY
                        No, ma'am. Not spelt the same at
                        all.

              She pushes the covers aside to rise. Hal tries to stop her...

                                  HAL
                        Melly, no...

              ...but she pushes his hand gently aside. Hal watches in
              wonder as she stands, takes a first tentative step...and
              walks to Coffey. She gazes up and touches his face.

                                  MELINDA
                        I dreamed of you. I dreamed you
                        were wandering in the dark, and so
                        was I. We found each other. We
                        found each other in the dark.

              She undoes her necklace, holds it up for him. He hesitates,
              glances to Paul. Paul nods--it's all right. Coffey lowers his
              head. Melinda affixes the delicate chain around his neck.

                                  MELINDA
                        It's St. Christopher. I want you
                        to have it, Mr. Coffey, and wear
                        it. He'll keep you safe. Please
                        wear it for me.

                                  COFFEY
                        Thank you, ma'am.

                                  MELINDA
                        Thank you, John.

              Her arms go around his neck, hugging him tightly as if she
              might never let go.

              EXT. MOORES HOUSE - NIGHT

              Paul and the men hustle Coffey out the front door toward the
              truck, helping him as best they can. He's weak as a baby,
              knees threatening to give out at any moment.

                                  PAUL
                        C'mon, John, stay on your feet.

                                  HARRY
                        Christ, he goes down, we'll need
                        three mules and a crane to pick
                        him up again...

              They get Coffey to the truck and throw their backs into it,
              helping him crawl up onto the stakebed. He rolls over on his
              back. Harry hops up, covers him with an old blanket. Brutal
              pulls aside, speaking low:

                                  BRUTAL
                        He'll never sit in Old Sparky. You
                        know that, don't you?
                               (off Paul's look)
                        He swallowed that stuff for a
                        reason. I give him a few days. One
                        of us'll be doing a cell check and
                        there he'll be. Dead on his bunk.

                                  PAUL
                        If that's his choice, he's earned
                        it.
                               (beat)
                        Let's get him back on the Mile.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                                  "Coffey on the Mile"

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Dean starts babbling with relief as they return:

                                  DEAN
                        Am I glad to see you! You were
                        gone so long! Wild Bill's making
                        noises like he's gonna wake up...
                               (notices Coffey)
                        What the hell's wrong with him?

                                  BRUTAL
                        He's hurting, Dean. Hurting bad.

              Dean jumps in, helps them steer Coffey into his cell.

                                  PAUL
                        John, we're gonna set you on your
                        bunk now. Ready?

              Coffey nods, sits heavily on the bunk. He lowers his head,
              breath rasping like a rusted hinge. The guards step out.

                                  DEAN
                        What about Mrs. Moores? Was it
                        like the mouse? Was it a...you
                        know...a miracle?

                                  PAUL
                        Yes. Yes it was.

              Paul scans their faces. Smiles are traded. An exultant beat.

                                  HARRY
                        Damn. I think we got away with it.

                                  BRUTAL
                        We still gotta convince a certain
                        somebody to keep his trap shut.

                                  PAUL
                        Get his stuff.

              Dean hurries off to retrieve Percy's holster and baton.
              Brutal unlocks the restraint room door, swings it open. Percy
              is revealed sitting against the wall, glaring, his mouth
              still taped. Paul crouches down. Brutal joins him.

                                  PAUL
                        I want to talk, not shout. I take
                        the tape off, you gonna be calm.

              Percy nods. Paul takes hold of the tape, preparing to yank.

                                  BRUTAL
                        My mother always said if you do it
                        fast, it won't hurt so much.

              Paul rips the tape off. Percy's eyes water with pain.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I guess she was wrong.

                                  PERCY
                        Get me out of this nut-coat.

                                  PAUL
                        In a minute.

                                  PERCY
                        Now! Now! Right n--

              Paul slaps him hard, knocks him sideways. Percy looks up,
              blinking in surprise. Paul grabs him, yanks him back up.

                                  PAUL
                        You shut up and listen. You
                        deserved to be punished for what
                        you did to Del. You'll accept it
                        like a man, or we'll make you
                        sorry you were ever born. We'll
                        tell people how you sabotaged
                        Del's execution--

                                  PERCY
                        Sabotaged!

                                  PAUL
                        --and how you pissed yourself like
                        a frightened little girl. Yes,
                        we'll talk, that's a given--but,
                        Percy, mind me now...we'll also
                        see you beaten within an inch of
                        your life.

              Percy blinks, unable to grasp that.

                                  PAUL
                        We know people, too, are you so
                        foolish you don't realize that?
                        People with friends and loved ones
                        doing time in this prison. People
                        who'd be happy to amputate you
                        nose or your penis just so someone
                        they care about could get an extra
                        three hours in the exercise yard
                        every week.
                               (off Percy's look)
                        Let bygones be bygones. Nothing's
                        hurt so far but your pride...and
                        nobody need ever know about that
                        except the people in this room.

                                  BRUTAL
                        What happens on the Mile, stays on
                        the Mile. Always has.

              A long pause. Softly:

                                  PERCY
                        May I be let out of this coat now?

              They pull him to his feet, undo the straps. He shrugs out of
              the straitjacket and adjusts his clothes, trying to maintain
              a shred of dignity.

                                  PERCY
                        My things?

              Dean hands them over. Percy smooths his hair and puts his hat
              on, starts strapping on his holster belt.

                                  PAUL
                        Think it over, Percy.

                                  PERCY
                        Oh, I intend to. I intend to think
                        about it very hard. Starting right
                        now.

              Percy exits the restraint room. Brutal whispers to Paul:

                                  BRUTAL
                        He'll talk. Sooner or later.

              Paul nods with weary resignation--yeah, I know.

              ON THE MILE

              Percy pauses near Coffey's cell, careless as always, getting
              his holster buckled--and a massive black arm grabs him
              through the bars. His SCREAM brings Paul and the others from
              the restraint room.

              Coffey's face is pressed so tight between his bars it looks
              like he's trying to push his head through. He draws his lips
              back, baring his teeth in an awful sneer...

              Percy whacks him with his baton. Coffey barely seems to feel
              it. He curls his free hand around the back of Percy's head,
              pulling him ever closer...

              ...and Percy's screams are muffled as their mouths come
              together. Coffey begins exhaling as if he'd held his breath
              for hours. Percy jerks like a fish on a hook, but can't get
              away. The men jump in, try to pry Percy loose, hollering for
              Coffey to let him go.

              The black "insects" are flowing from Coffey to Percy,
              swirling into his mouth, up his nose, down his throat.

              Several lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and down
              the Mile. Percy's baton drops from his nerveless fingers and
              clatters to the floor, never to be picked up again.

              And then Coffey steps back, rubbing his mouth as if he's
              tasted something bad. The color has returned to his skin.

              Percy, however, is ashen gray. His expression is blank as a
              sheet of paper, not a trace of awareness in his eyes.

              The men are stunned. Paul raises his hand to Percy's face,
              snaps his fingers. Nothing. He tries again, clapping loudly.
              Percy reacts slightly, eyes fluttering, swaying a bit.

                                  PAUL
                        Easy, easy. You all right?

              Percy says nothing. He turns and walks slowly up the Mile,
              his movements vacant and disjointed. He comes to a swaying
              stop at Wild Bill's cell...and turns slowly to look in.

              Wild Bill is coming painfully around, groggily clutching his
              head. He looks up, see Percy.

                                  BILLY
                        What'a you looking at, you limp
                        noodle? You wanna kiss my ass or
                        suck my dick?

              Nothing for the longest moment. Percy just staring...

              ...and then he pulls his gun and empties it into Wild Bill as
              fast as he can pull the trigger. BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!
              Bill takes all six rounds in the chest, reeling back across
              the cell. He hits the wall and slides down, leaving a smear,
              his face registering a final look of stunned surprise.

              Paul and the other tackle Percy and bring him down, wrestling
              the gun out of his hand. Dean is almost weeping:

                                  DEAN
                        Oh God, oh God, no...

              Percy is flat on his back, staring up at nothing. The black
              "bugs" come drifting out of nose and mouth, swirling in the
              air over his head. They turn white and disappear.

              The men are speechless. Paul turns, sees Coffey sitting on
              the floor at his bars, watching.

                                  COFFEY
                        Punished them bad men.

                                  PAUL
                        Why Wild Bill? Why?

                                  COFFEY
                        I saw in his heart. When he grab
                        my arm, I saw what Wild Billy
                        done. Saw plain as day. Can't hide
                        what's in your heart.

                                  PAUL
                        What? Saw what?

              Coffey reaches toward him, straining through the bars.

                                  COFFEY
                        Take my hand, boss. You see for
                        yourself.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Paul, no!

              Paul hesitates, torn between reason and Coffey's pleading
              eyes. A whisper:

                                  COFFEY
                        My hand.

              Paul can't help it. He has to. Their hands come together.
              Paul lurches wildly as that circuit starts blazing between
              them...

                                  PAUL
                        No...please...

                                  COFFEY
                        Gots to, boss. Gots to give you a
                        little bit of myself. A gift,
                        like. A gift of what's in me so
                        you can see...

              ...and Paul sees:

              The Detterick twins. Kathe and Cora. Laughing and playing
              hopscotch in the dust under a later afternoon sun...

              A dinner table. Family having supper late in the day, basket
              of biscuits being passed. Twelve year old Howie Detterick
              taking it, passing it on...

              An hand with a paint brush slopping bright red paint on the
              side of a barn...

              Kathe skipping to the head of the hopscotch squares, turning
              and starting back, laughing in the sun...

              The paint brush slopping more paint, dripping like blood...

              Paul jerks and twists, trying to pull away, trying to break
              the circuit, but he can't, not till all is seen and done:

              Marjorie Detterick calling from the porch for everybody to
              come eat, supper's ready...

              A hammer pausing. Klaus looking down from atop the barn...

              The Detterick twins finishing their hopscotch, gathering
              their jump ropes from the dust, running across the yard...

              The basket of biscuits being passed to little Cora, who takes
              a biscuit and passes it on...

              Klaus coming down the ladder, calling to his daughters. The
              little girls running past the man with the paint brush, who
              turns and smile as they go by...it's Wild Bill.

              The basket of biscuits is passed one last time. A hand pulls
              one out, raises it for a bite. It's Wild Bill, smiling at the
              little girls as conversation flows around the table...

              Paul screams, trying to pull away, but:

              The porch door is kicked off its hinges just before dawn, a
              figure looming in the doorway. Kathe wakes, her scream cut
              short as the man's fist punches her hard in the face...

              Paul trembles violently as if riding the lightning himself,
              pleading for it to stop, but there's one last thing:

              Wild Bill looms over the terrified little girls like a
              horrendous boogeyman, whispers to Kathe:

                                  BILLY
                        You lover your sister? You make
                        any noise, know what happens? I'll
                        kill her instead of you.
                               (to Cora)
                        And if you make any noise, I'll
                        kill her.

              And he drags them out into the coming dawn...

              ...as Coffey lets Paul go. Paul is gasping, back in the real
              world where his men are staring at him with wide eyes.

                                  COFFEY
                        He kill 'em with they love. They
                        love for each other. You see how
                        it is?

              Paul nods, numb. Tears are flowing down Coffey's face. Softly:

                                  COFFEY
                        That's how it is ever' day. That's
                        how it is all over the worl'...

                                                       CUT TO:

              WILD BILL

              lies dead, staring with glassy eyes. A FLASHBULB POPS,
              rimming him with harsh blue light...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAWN

              ...as Hal arrives, wearing his pajama top under his overcoat.
              He sees the POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER taking pictures. The guards
              are giving statements to GROUPS OF COPS, everybody murmuring:

                                  DEAN
                        ...well, I dunno, he just snapped,
                        I guess...

                                  HARRY
                        ...s'right, one minute he's fine,
                        the next--blammo...

                                  BRUTAL
                        ...bastard grabbed him through the
                        bars a few days back, scared the
                        boy so bad he wet himself...

              Hal turns, sees:

              PERCY

              sits handcuffed on the floor of the Mile, eyes glassier than
              Wild Bill's. TWO COPS are trying to snap him out of it:

                                  COP #1
                        Son! Son! Can you hear me?

                                  COP #2
                        Speak up if you can hear us! We
                        gotta ask you some questions!

              A MEDIC is raising Percy's eyelid with his thumb, shining a
              penlight, getting no reaction.

                                  MEDIC
                        I think this boy's cheese slid off
                        his cracker.

              HAL

              sees Paul, motions him aside to talk privately:

                                  HAL
                        I'll cover you as much as I can,
                        even if it mean my job, but I have
                        to know. Does this have anything
                        to do with what happened at my
                        house? Does it, Paul?

              Paul looks Hal in the eye. As with Bitterbuck, the lie comes
              easy:

                                  PAUL
                        No.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

              TRACKING A PAIR OF FEET shuffling into the room in hospital
              slippers, escorted by TWO ORDERLIES. The patient is brought
              to a window. The orderlies turn to leave...

              ...and we BOOM UP to reveal Percy, catatonic, staring out the
              same window where we met Wild Bill...

              EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

              ...and we WIDEN SLOWLY from Percy at the window to reveal his
              last stop in life. It's emblazoned on the gate: BRIAR RIDGE
              MENTAL HOSPITAL. He finally got that transfer.

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DUSK

              TIGHT ON PAUL as softly:

                                  PAUL
                        It makes sense. I read the file.
                        Hal even said it himself. Wharton
                        rambled all over the state last
                        few years, causing trouble. Hell,
                        longer than that. Been at it since
                        he was ten. Vandalism. Petty
                        theft. Setting fires.

              ANGLE SHIFTS to include Jan, Brutal, Harry and Dean. They're
              in the brambly patch that borders the woods behind the house.
              The sun is setting, turning the horizon fiery.

                                  JAN
                        You saw him. You actually saw this
                        Wild Bill person take those girls.

                                  PAUL
                        Their father hired him on for a
                        few days last spring, help repair
                        the barn. Cheap labor, just
                        another drifter...

                                  BRUTAL
                        Only not.

                                  PAUL
                        Sick bastard came back a month
                        later, just before dawn. Took the
                        girls...did what he did. Coffey
                        found them afterwards and tried to
                        help. It was too late.

                                  JAN
                               (absorbs this)
                        Then you can stop it. The
                        execution, I mean. Get Coffey a
                        new trial.

                                  PAUL
                        Based on what, honey? Some kind of
                        magical vision I had?

                                  JAN
                        Show this farmer--what's his name,
                        Detterick?--show him a picture of
                        Wild Bill.
                               (off their looks)
                        Why not? If Wharton was there...if
                        the farmer can identify his
                        picture and they know he was
                        there...

                                  BRUTAL
                        Him being there in May doesn't
                        mean he came back and killed those
                        girls in June. Even if he was
                        committing other crimes.

                                  PAUL
                        They got their killer as far as
                        they're concerned.

                        Hell, Coffey's own lawyer would
                        come throw the switch if we let
                        him.

                                  JAN
                        Then lie.

                                  PAUL
                        Lie? About what?

                                  JAN
                        Tell them Wharton confessed to the
                        crime. Brutus, you can back him
                        up, say you heard it too. You can
                        say that's what set Percy off. He
                        shot Wharton because he couldn't
                        stand thinking of what happened to
                        those two little girls, it snapped
                        his mind...
                               (seeing their looks)
                        ...what? What now?

                                  DEAN
                        We never reported anything like
                        that. We would've, too, everybody
                        knows it. It's part of our job.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Besides, confessing don't make it
                        so. Slugs like Wild Bill lie about
                        everything. Crimes they committed,
                        women they had, even the weather.

                                  JAN
                        But he was there! He painted their
                        barn! He ate dinner with them!

                                  PAUL
                        All the more reason he might take
                        credit for the crime. He's gonna
                        fry anyway, so why not boast?

              Jan stands thinking for a moment, then:

                                  JAN
                        All right. Then you've got to get
                        John Coffey out on your own.

                                  HARRY
                        Ma'am?

                                  JAN
                        You did it once, didn't you? Only
                        this time, don't bring him back.

              Dean blinks, stunned by this notion. Gently:

                                  DEAN
                        Ma'am, your son's grown up and
                        moved away. My kids are just
                        starting kindergarten. Will you be
                        the one to explain to them why
                        their daddy's in prison?

                                  JAN
                        Work out a plan. Make it look like
                        a real escape.

                                  HARRY
                        Better be a plan an imbecile could
                        dream up. Nobody'd believe it
                        otherwise.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Even if we did think of something,
                        it wouldn't do any good.

                                  JAN
                        Why not? Just why the hell not?

                                  PAUL
                        Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch
                        baldheaded black man with barely
                        enough brains to feed himself. How
                        long you think it'd be before he
                        was recaptured? Two hours? Six?

              Jan swipes a tear away with the heel of her hand. Softly:

                                  JAN
                        Do you mean to kill him, you
                        cowards? Do you?

              Paul tries to take her hand. She wrenches away, furious.

                                  JAN
                        Don't touch me! Next week this
                        time you'll be a murderer, no
                        better than that man Wharton, so
                        don't touch me!

              She runs off toward the house, starting to sob as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT  PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

              Paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours, at his regular
              place, sipping his beer. Irving Berlin's "Remember" PLAYS
              SOFTLY on the radio. Jan comes down, looking miserable and
              exhausted.

                                  JAN
                        I'm so sorry I called you a
                        coward. I feel worse about that
                        than anything I've ever said to
                        you in our whole marriage.

                                  PAUL
                        Even that time we went camping and
                        you called me Old Stinky Sam?

              She can't help smiling at that. He returns the smile, offers
              her a sip of beer. She takes it, sits.

                                  JAN
                        Does Hal know? That Coffey's
                        innocent, I mean?
                               (Paul shakes his head)
                        Can he help? Does he have the
                        influence to do something about
                        this?

                                  PAUL
                        No.

                                  JAN
                        Then don't tell him. If he can't
                        help, don't tell him. Ever.

                                  PAUL
                        I won't.

                        There's no way out of this for
                        you, is there?

                                  PAUL
                        No. I've been thinking about it,
                        too, believe me.
                               (beat)
                        Tell you the truth, honey. I've
                        done some things in my life I'm
                        not proud of, but this is the
                        first time I've ever felt in real
                        danger of hell.

                                  JAN
                        Hell? Oh Paul...
                               (touches his face)
                        Talk to him. Talk to John. Find
                        out what he wants.

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Coffey sits quietly in his cell, a solitary firefly flitting
              in circles around his finger. Paul and the men appear. The
              firefly flits away, vanishing through Coffey's tiny window.

                                  COFFEY
                        Hello, boss.

                                  PAUL
                        Hello, John.

              Brutal unlocks his cell. Paul enters.

                                  PAUL
                        I guess you know we're coming down
                        to it now. Another couple of days.
                               (beat)
                        Is there anything special you'd
                        like for dinner that night? We can
                        rustle you up most anything.

              Coffey gives it some careful thought.

                                  COFFEY
                        Meatloaf be nice. Mashed taters
                        with gravy. Okra, maybe. I's not
                        picky.

                                  PAUL
                        What about a preacher? Someone you
                        could say a little prayer with?

                                  COFFEY
                        Don't want no preacher. You can
                        say a prayer, if you want. I could
                        get kneebound with you, I guess.

                                  PAUL
                        Me?

              Coffey gives him a look--please.

                                  PAUL
                        S'pose I could, if it came to that.

              Paul sits, working himself up to it:

                                  PAUL
                        John, I have to ask you something
                        very important right now.

                                  COFFEY
                        I know what you gonna say. You
                        don' have to say it.

                                  PAUL
                        I do. I do have to.
                               (beat)
                        John, tell me what you want me to
                        do. You want me to take you out of
                        here? Just let you run away? See
                        how far you can get?

                                  COFFEY
                        Why would you do such a foolish
                        thing?

              Paul hesitates, emotions swirling, trying to find the right
              words.

                                  PAUL
                        On the day of my judgement, when
                        I stand before God, and He asks me
                        why did I kill one of his true
                        miracles, what am I gonna say?
                        That is was my job? My job?

                                  COFFEY
                        You tell God the Father it was a
                        kindness you done.
                               (takes his hand)
                        I know you hurtin' and worryin',
                        I can feel it on you, but you
                        oughtta quit on it now. Because I
                        want it over and done. I do.

              Coffey hesitates--now he's the one trying to find the right
              words, trying to make Paul understand:

                                  COFFEY
                        I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on
                        the road, lonely as a sparrow in
                        the rain. Tired of not ever having
                        me a buddy to be with, or tell me
                        where we's coming from or going
                        to, or why. Mostly I'm tired of
                        people being ugly to each other.

                        I'm tired of all the pain I feel
                        and hear in the world ever' day.
                        There's too much of it. It's like
                        pieces of glass in my head all the
                        time. Can you understand?

              By now, Paul is blinking back tears. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        Yes, John. I think I can.

                                  BRUTAL
                        There must be something we can do
                        for you, John. There must be
                        something you want.

              Coffey thinks about this long and hard, finally looks up.

                                  COFFEY
                        I ain't never seen me a flicker
                        show.

                        Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my
                        heart beats so that I can hardly
                        speak...

              Paul and the men are scattered about in the otherwise empty
              auditorium, also watching.

              PROJECTION BOOTH

              Toot operates the projector, peering through the tiny window
              into the theater. He yawns, glances at his watch. Late.

              IN THE AUDITORIUM

              Fred and Ginger are now in the most passionate and graceful
              part of the dance. Irving Berlin's music swells.

              COFFEY

              can't believe what he's seeing. He's so excited his breath is
              caught in his throat. Softly:

                                  COFFEY
                        Why, they's angels. Angels. Just
                        like up in heaven...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              FOUR PAIRS OF FEET come marching up the Green Mile.

              ANGLE ON COFFEY

              Paul appears at the bars with Brutal, Harry, and Dean.
              Nothing is said. Coffey knows why they're here. He rises as
              Brutal unlocks the cell, slides the door open. Coffey steps
              out, looks around at their dazed and sad faces.

                                  COFFEY
                        I be all right, fellas. This
                        here's the hard part. I be all
                        right in a little while.

              Paul indicates St. Christopher medal around John's neck:

                                  PAUL
                        John, I should have that just for
                        now. I'll give it back after.

              John lets him take the necklace. Paul pockets it. They start
              to walk the Mile as:

                                  COFFEY
                        You know, I fell asleep this
                        afternoon and had me a dream. I
                        dreamed about Del's mouse.

                                  PAUL
                        Did you, John?

                                  COFFEY
                        I dreamed he got down to that
                        place Boss Howell talked about,
                        that Mouseville place. I dreamed
                        there was kids, and how they
                        laughed at his tricks! My!

              He laughs at the memory of it, then grows more serious:

                                  COFFEY
                        I dreamed those two little blonde-
                        headed girls were there. They 'us
                        laughing, too. I put my arms
                        around 'em and sat 'em on my
                        knees, and there 'us no blood
                        comin' outta their hair and they
                        'us fine. We all watch Mr. Jingles
                        roll that spool, and how we did
                        laugh. Fit to bus', we was.

              Behind them, Dean stifles a sob.

              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE

              Coffey kneels. Paul joins him, self-conscious and uncertain.

                                  PAUL
                        What should we pray for, John?

                                  COFFEY
                        Strength?

              Paul nods--strength it is. Dean surprises Brutal and Harry by
              also kneeling. Brutal and Harry hesitate...then join them.

                                  PAUL
                        God, please help us finish what
                        we've started, and please welcome
                        this man, John Coffey--like the
                        drink, but not spelled the same--
                        into heaven and give him peace.
                        Please help us to see him off the
                        best we can and let nothing go
                        wrong. Amen.

              Paul starts to rise, but Coffey takes his hand.

                                  COFFEY
                        I know a prayer I once heard. Can
                        I say it?

                                  PAUL
                        You go right ahead, John. Take all
                        the time you need.

              Coffey closes his eyes, frowning in deep concentration.

                                  COFFEY
                        Baby Jesus, meek and mild, pray
                        for me...

              And Paul sees:

              Kathe and Cora Detterick kneeling together in the enclosed
              porch that night, just before their bedtime:

                                  KATHE AND CORA
                        ...and every child. Be my
                        strength, be my friend...

              And then the vision is gone as:

                                  COFFEY
                        ...be with me until the end. Amen.

              Coffey rises, offers Paul his hand, helps him up.

              EXECUTION CHAMBER

              Full house tonight. Bill Dodge is waiting at Old Sparky.

              Silence as Coffey is led in, all eyes on him. Klaus and
              Marjorie Detterick are in the front row. She mutters:

                                  MARJORIE
                        Die slow, you bastard.

              COFFEY

              is faltering as Paul and Brutal bring him to the chair.

                                  COFFEY
                        They's a lot of folks here hate
                        me. A lot. I can feel it. Like
                        bees stinging me. It hurts.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Feel how we feel, then. We don't
                        hate you--can you feel that?

              Coffey tries to take comfort in it, but flinches as:

                                  MARJORIE
                        Kill him twice, you boys! You go
                        on and kill that raping baby-
                        killer twice, that'd be fine!

              She dissolves into tears. Klaus pulls her against his
              shoulder, looking dazed by the whole thing.

              Paul and Brutal turn John around, sit him down. Paul notices
              Dean crying again, his back to the witnesses. They kneel to
              apply the leg clamps, while Brutal and Harry secure the arms.

                                  PAUL
                        Wipe you face before you stand up,
                        Dean.

              Dean nods, wiping his face with the sleeve of his coat. They
              rise, stepping back. This time, Paul's out front:

                                  PAUL
                        Roll on one.

              Van Hay cranks the generator. The lights flare hotter and
              brighter. It's just like in Melinda's bedroom the night
              Coffey cured her with a kiss. Airless and bright, dreamlike.

                                  MARJORIE
                        Does it hurt yet? I hope it does!
                        I hope it hurts like hell!

                                  PAUL
                        John Coffey...you have been
                        condemned to die in the electric
                        chair by a jury of your
                        peers...sentence imposed by a
                        judge in good standing in this
                        state. Do you have anything to say
                        before sentence is carried out?

              John hesitates, nods.

                                  COFFEY
                        I'm sorry for what I am.

                                  MARJORIE
                        You ought to be! Oh, you monster,
                        you damn well ought to be!

              Brutal takes the mask from the hook to draw it over Coffey's
              head. Coffey looks to Paul with terrified, pleading eyes.

                                  COFFEY
                        Please, boss, don't put that thing
                        over my face. Don't put me in the
                        dark, I's afraid of the dark.

                                  PAUL
                        All right, John.

              Brutal puts the mask back, proceeds with the sponge.

              IN TIGHT ANGLES

              The cap is lowered, the straps drawn. Coffey is breathing
              fast, terrified, muttering under his breath:

                                  COFFEY
                        ...heaven...I'm in heaven...
                        heaven...heaven...heaven...

              THE WITNESSES

              sit and wait, barely breathing.

              JACK VAN HAY

              is poised at the switch, wondering why the order won't come.

              PAUL

              is staring at Coffey, unable to say the words.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (whispers)
                        Paul. You have to say it. You have
                        to give the order.

              Paul can't. He reaches out and touches Coffey's hand. Their
              fingers clasp. In that moment, staring into his eyes, Paul
              hears the last thought that ever goes through Coffey's head:

                                  COFFEY
                               (whispered V.O.)
                        He kill 'em with they love. That's
                        how it is ever' day. All over the
                        worl'...

              Their fingers disengage. Paul steps back, eyes still locked
              with Coffey's, and says the hardest words he's ever spoken:

                                  PAUL
                        Roll on two.

              Van Hay throws the switch. Coffey surges forward, fingers
              splayed and jittering past Old Sparky's arms.

              Lights begin blowing out all over the Mile, raining shattered
              glass and sparks. Some of the witnesses scream.

              A thin line of blood comes trickling out of Klaus Detterick's
              nose. He reaches up, absently wipes it away.

              Coffey's eyes are locked on Paul's, riding the lightning all
              the way. He finally slumps. Van Hay kills the current.

              Coffey's expression is peaceful, as if sleeping. A final pair
              of tears drift gently down his cheeks.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              Paul ever so carefully replaces the St. Christopher's medal
              around Coffey's neck. They wheel him down the tunnel.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. PAUL'S MODEL T - NIGHT

              Paul drives home, his heart numb.

              EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

              Paul pulls in, cuts the engine. He sits for a moment, then
              gets out and heads for the house.

              The door opens. Jan steps out in her nightgown and robe to
              meet him on the stairs. She takes him in her arms.

              Paul can't hold it back anymore. He breaks down sobbing
              against her as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. NURSING HOME SUNROOM - PRESENT DAY

              It's late in the day as:

                                  PAUL
                        That was the last execution I ever
                        took part in. Just couldn't do it
                        anymore after that. Brutal either.
                        We both transferred out, took jobs
                        with Boys' Correctional.
                               (beat, nods)
                        That was all right. Catch 'em
                        young, that became my motto. Might
                        even have done some good.

              ANGLE SHIFTS TO Elaine listening. Uncertain.

                                  PAUL
                        You don't believe me.

                                  ELAINE
                        I don't imagine you would lie to
                        me, Paul. It's just that...

                                  PAUL
                        ...It's quite a story.

                                  ELAINE
                        Yes. Quite a story.
                               (pause)
                        One thing I don't understand. You
                        said you and Jan had a grownup son
                        in 1935. Is that right?
                               (Paul nods)
                        But if that's true...

                                  PAUL
                        The math doesn't work, does it?

              She shakes her head. Paul thinks for a moment, comes to a
              decision.

                                  PAUL
                        You feel up to a walk?

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. GEORGIA PINES - DAY

              The rain has mostly stopped. Brad Dolan, back in street
              clothes, gets in his pickup truck and drives away...

              INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

              ...while Paul and Elaine watch from a window.

              EXT. GEORGIA PINES - DAY

              This time, we see two red specks trudging slowly up the ridge
              toward the treeline.

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. WOODS - DAY

              Paul brings Elaine along the wooded path into view of the
              storage shacks. They're both wearing ponchos.

                                  PAUL
                        There. It's in there.

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul? This thing you want to show
                        me. Is it scary?

                                  PAUL
                        Scary? No. Not really.

              He gives her a smile, offers his hand. She takes it.

              INT. SHACK - DAY

              We see Paul approach through the grimy window as before, this
              time bringing Elaine. ANGLE SHIFTS to the door as they
              arrive, creaking open on rusty hinges to reveal them.

              They enter. Elaine looks around at the musty nooks and
              crannies, wondering what they're doing here. Paul touchers
              arm, directs her attention:

                                  PAUL
                        There.

              Elaine moves closer, sees it on the dusty floorboards:

              An old cigar box.

              For a moment, she doesn't know what to make of it.

                                  PAUL
                        Hey. Wake up, old boy. Wake up.

              Elaine's breath catches in her throat...

              ...as a pair of bright oilspot eyes peer over the edge of the
              cigar box. It's a mouse. His fur, once brown, is now all gray.

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul? It isn't...it can't be...

              Paul gets down on the floor, holds out his hand.

                                  PAUL
                        Come over here, boy. Come on over
                        her and see this lady.

              The mouse tries several times to get over the side of the
              cigar box before he finally makes it. He comes to them,
              hobbling and crippled with arthritis. Paul pulls a slice of
              toast from his pocket, breaks off a small piece for the mouse.

                                  ELAINE
                        That can't be Mr. Jingles.

              Paul says nothing, just pulls a spool from his pocket. Mr.
              Jingles might be old, but he's as obsessed as ever. He gets
              ready to fetch, eyes riveted to the spool. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        Messieurs et mesdames. Beinvenue
                        au cirque du mousie.

              Paul tosses the spool. The mouse limps painfully after it. He
              reaches it, goes around...and has to lay down to catch his
              breath. Elaine starts forward, but Paul holds her back.

              After a moment, Mr. Jingles finds his feet again. He rises
              and starts nosing the spool back to Paul.

                                  ELAINE
                        Oh, Paul. Don't make him do it
                        again. I can't bear to watch.

                                  PAUL
                               (softly)
                        But he loves it so much.

              He glances around at the shack with a sad smile.

                                  PAUL
                        This isn't exactly the Mouseville
                        we had in mind...but we make do,
                        don't we, old fella?

                                  BRAD (O.S.)
                        As I live and breathe!

              They gasp and spin. Brad Dolan stands in the doorway.

                                  BRAD
                        Fooled you, didn't I Got yourself
                        a little love nest here, I see...

              He pauses, seeing Mr. Jingles.

                                  BRAD
                        ...what the fuck? Is that a mouse?

                                  PAUL
                        Don't hurt him, okay? Okay?

                                  BRAD
                        It's a goddamn mouse, y'old fool,
                        they carry all kind'a disease...

              Brad grabs an old garden hoe--the blade's rusted, but still
              sharp enough to cut a mouse in two.

                                  BRAD
                        ...now step aside.

              Paul rushes in front of Brad, fists clenched, yelling:

                                  PAUL
                        You leave him alone, Percy! You
                        leave him alone, or by God I'll--

              Brad gives Paul a hard shove, pins him against the wall.

                                  BRAD
                        Who you calling Percy? Name's
                        Brad, you senile fucker. And I'm
                        gonna nail that mouse, you can
                        take that to the everfucking bank.

              Elaine is suddenly at Brad's elbow, seething with fury:

                                  ELAINE
                        How dare you? Get out!

                                  BRAD
                        Piss off, you wrinkeldy old bitch.
                        Me and Paulie are talking.

                                  ELAINE
                        His name is Mr. Edgecomb. If you
                        ever call him Paulie again, your
                        days of employment at Georgia
                        Pines will end.

                                  BRAD
                        Who the hell you think you are?

                                  ELAINE
                        I am the grandmother of the man
                        who is currently Speaker of the
                        Georgia House of Representatives.
                        A man who loves his relatives, Mr.
                        Dolan. All it would take is a
                        phone call.

              Brad's smile falters. Elaine steps closer.

                                  ELAINE
                        At first I thought I'd let you be.
                        I'm old, and that seemed easiest.
                        But when my friends are threatened
                        and abused, I do not let it be.
                               (icy beat)
                        Now get out, or you won't work
                        another day here. Not another
                        hour. I swear it.

              Brad eases his grip on Paul...and backs off.

                                  BRAD
                        Don't know what you're getting so
                        het up about. Just a damn mouse.

                                  ELAINE
                        Get out, you ignorant man. What
                        little mind you have is ugly and
                        misdirected.

              Brad flushes red, heads for the door. He pauses.

                                  BRAD
                        Don't bother coming back here
                        tomorrow...Mr. Edgecomb Gonna be
                        a new lock on this door. This is
                        off-limits to residents, no matter
                        what Mrs. My Shit Don't Stink has
                        to say about it.

              And off he goes. Paul tries to control the shaking in his
              hands, looks to Elaine.

                                  ELAINE
                        Little trick I learned from Percy
                        Wetmore.

                                  PAUL
                        Is your grandson really Speaker of
                        the House?

                                  ELAINE
                        He is.

              Paul bends down, picks Mr. Jingles up.

                                  PAUL
                        You gonna thank the lady? She just
                        saved your old mousie hide.

              The mouse stretches his neck forward, nose twitching,
              smelling Paul's breath. Paul looks to Elaine. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        I think Mr. Jingles happened by
                        accident. I think when we
                        electrocuted Del, and it all went
                        so badly...well, John could feel
                        it, you know...and I think a tiny
                        part of whatever was inside of him
                        just leapt out...
                               (beat)
                        Me, I was no accident. John had to
                        give me a little part of
                        himself...a gift, like...so I
                        could see for myself what Wild
                        Bill had done. When John did that,
                        a part of whatever power worked
                        through him spilled into me.

                                  ELAINE
                        He...what? Infected you with life?

              Paul looks at the mouse, strokes him gently between the ears.

                                  PAUL
                        That's as good a word as any. He
                        infected us both, didn't he, Mr.
                        Jingles. With life.
                               (beat)
                        I'm a hundred and five years old,
                        Elaine. I was forty the year John
                        Coffey walked the Green Mile.

                                  ELAINE
                        ...oh my God...

              CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN on Paul as:

                                  PAUL
                        I haven't even had a cold since
                        1935. I've had to watch my friends
                        and loved ones die off through the
                        years...Hal and Melinda...Brutus
                        Howell...my wife...my son...
                               (beat)
                        ...and you, Elaine. You'd die,
                        too, and my curse is knowing I'll
                        be there to see it...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

              Paul, dressed in a dark suit, comes up the aisle. ANGLE
              SHIFTS to reveal Elaine Connelly lying in the open casket.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        ...that's my punishment, you see?
                        My punishment for letting John
                        Coffey ride the lightning...for
                        killing a miracle of God...

              Paul lays a rose atop the casket.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        ...you'll be gone, like all the
                        others, and I'll have to stay...

              EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

              Paul stands at the graveside as the casket is lowered.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        I'll die eventually, I imagine. I
                        have no illusions of immortality.
                        But I will have wished for death
                        long before death finds me.

              He turns and walks away.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        In truth, I wish for it already.

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT(1935)

              Empty and silent. Young Paul walks the Mile alone, listening
              to the quiet. He pauses, seeing something. A whisper:

                                  PAUL
                        Mr. Jingles?

              It is Mr. Jingles. The little mouse is peering from under the
              restraint room door. He's come home, looking bedraggled. Paul
              bends down, gently picks him up.

                                  PAUL
                        Where you been, boy? I've been
                        worried about you. You hungry?

              Paul turns and head back up the Green Mile, carrying the
              mouse cupped in his hands as we

                                                       MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

              Young Paul transforms into Old Paul in the dissolve, the
              corridor of the Green Mile becoming the corridor of the
              nursing home. He's walking along, holding the little mouse
              the same way he did over sixty years ago.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        I lie in bed most nights, thinking
                        about it. And I wait...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

              Paul lies awake, staring at the moon outside his window.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        I think about all the people I've
                        loved, now long gone.

                        I think about my beautiful Jan,
                        and how I lost her so many years
                        ago. I think about all of us
                        walking our own Green Mile, each
                        in our own time. But one thought,
                        more than any other, keeps me
                        awake most nights...
                               (beat)
                        ...if he could make a mouse live
                        so long, how much longer do I have?

              He looks over at the nightstand...

                                  PAUL (V.O.)

SEATTLE 1988

EXT. FRONT YARD.  DAY.

        Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of
        unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class
        residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in
        shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram
        to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed
        Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades
        point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be
        ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An
        attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.

        Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the
        front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.

INT. MURPHY RESIDENCE. DAY.

                                WOMAN
                                (screams)
                    Oough! Ahhh!

                                SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                                (to others)
                    Upstairs.

        Troops pour into the house.

                                WOMAN
                    What's going on? What's the matter?
                    Who are you?

        The troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue
        entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles
        ready.

                                WOMAN
                    Hey!

        Upstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops
        descend on a bedroom.

                                WOMAN
                                (off camera)
                    Dade! Dade!

                                AGENT
                    Knock it down.

        The battering ram knocks down a bedroom door.

INT. COURTROOM.

        The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing
        argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.

                                PROSECUTOR
                    The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls
                    himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly
                    committed criminal acts of a malicious
                    nature. This defendant possesses a
                    superior intelligence, which he uses to a
                    destructive and antisocial end. His
                    computer virus crashed one thousand five
                    hundred and seven computer systems,
                    including Wall Street trading systems,
                    single handedly causing a seven point drop
                    in the New York Stock Market.

        As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning
        down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade
        Murphy.

        Fast forward to the sentencing.

                                JUDGE
                    Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family
                    forty-five thousand dollars...

        The court gasps, Dade's father winces

                                JUDGE
                    ...and sentence you to probation, under
                    which you are forbidden to own or operate
                    a computer or touch tone telephone, until
                    the day of your eighteenth birthday.

        Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.

        Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family
        and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and
        photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.

                        SEVEN YEARS LATER.

        Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the
        window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the
        aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a
        direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,
        which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips
        and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The
        title logo.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        Segue to Dade Murphy, now 18, wearing mirrorshades indoors
        and at night, working on his new computer. His mother
        calls him.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                                (off camera)
                    Dade?

                                DADE
                    Yeah, mom?

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    What are you doing?

                                DADE
                                (after a semi-pregnant pause)
                    I'm taking over a TV network.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy
                    birthday.

INT. OTV STUDIOS.

        In the OTV Studios security department, a phone rings, a
        man answers nervously.

                                NORM
                    Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.

                                DADE
                    Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from
                    Accounting. I just had a power surge here at
                    home that wiped out a file I was working on.
                    Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know
                    anything about computers?

                                NORM
                    Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...

                                DADE
                    Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just
                    went AWOL, and I've got this big project due
                    tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get
                    it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari
                    Kari...

                                NORM
                    Uhhh.. ahahaha...

                                DADE
                    Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management
                    techniques.
                                (pause)
                    Could you, uh, read me the number on the
                    modem?

                                NORM
                    Uhhhmm...

                                DADE
                    It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches
                    on it... lets my computer talk to the one
                    there...

                                NORM
                    212-555-4240.

        Dade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry
        of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.
        He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and
        then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback
        System. There is a graphic representation of the
        station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his
        TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh
        type TV show.

                                COMMENTATOR
                                (on TV)
                    ...so-called American Indians, Latinos and
                    Blacks come from a genetically mediocre
                    stock...

                                DADE
                    Yak yak yak. Get a job!

        Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer
        diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm
        selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of
        tapes.  The "America First" tape slides out of the VTR and
        is replaced by an episode of "The Outer Limits" as Dade
        watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.

                                TV
                    You are about to experience the awe and
                    mystery, which reaches from the inner mind,
                    to... The Outer Limits.

                                DADE
                    Yesssss!

        Suddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous
        message:

                        U HAVE TREAD
                        UPON MY DOMAIN &
                        MUST NOW SUFFER
                        WHO R U?

                                DADE
                    Hey! What?

        He starts to type ZERO...

                                DADE
                    No, wait.

        Dade types:

                        CRASH OVERRIDE.
                        WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

        Dade's screen dissolves into:

                        ACID BURN

                                DADE
                    Unbelievable. A hacker!

        Then the screen changes again:

                        ACID BURN
                        SEZ LEAVE B 4
                        U R EXPUNGED

        "The Outer Limits" suddenly flashes off.

                                DADE
                    Yeah, okay "Acid Burn", that's enough.

        Dade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The
        tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes
        fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps
        changing.

        The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:

                        I WILL
                        SWAT U LIKE
                        THE FLY U R

        More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.
        Another message.

                        I WILL
                        SNAP YOUR BACK
                        LIKE A TOOTHPICK

        As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:

                        MESS WITH THE BEST
                        DIE LIKE THE REST

        One last from Acid Burn:

                        YOU ARE
                        TERMINATED

        Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection
        is terminated.

                                DADE
                    Shit on me!

        Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges
        from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging
        moving boxes) for the fridge.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?

                                DADE
                    Mm-hmm.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Up all night again, huh?

                                DADE
                    Can this wait until both my eyes are open,
                    please?

        Dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the
        building superintendent.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll
                    sleep normal hours? He's been playing with
                    his computer all night for a solid week.
                                (pause)
                    Well yes, he could be playing with himself.
                    Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,
                    don't you?

                                DADE
                    Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as
                    charming as you yet.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    You haven't been doing anything stupid, right,
                    Dade?
                                (louder)
                    Right, Dade?!

                                DADE
                    Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!

        Dade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks
        his room. Dade is showering.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                                (angry, through the bathroom door)
                    You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
                    Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up
                    again and you won't get into college!

        She pauses and regains some of her cool.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
                    I didn't want to sell the house but I had to
                    take this new job, you know that. You're
                    going to love New York, it's the city that
                    never sleeps!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY.

        We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun
        shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day
        and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment
        on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL.

        At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,
        head to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up
        to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle
        shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.

                                DADE
                    Excuse me.

                                KID
                    Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.

                                DADE
                    Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the
                    principal's office.

                                KID
                    Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

        Now Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the
        office.

INT. OFFICE.

        Dade is filling out a form.

                                GIRL
                    Do you have your transfer forms?

        Dade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly
        unconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.

                                GIRL
                    It's a relatively straightforward question.

        Dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches
        into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,
        all involving lips and kissing.

                                GIRL
                    Do you speak English?

                                DADE
                    Sorry, you wanted...?

                                GIRL
                    I wanted transfer forms.

        He gives them to her.

                                GIRL
                    Thank you.

        She starts leaving. He doesn't.

                                GIRL
                    Are you coming?

        Dade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on
        a brief tour.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

                                GIRL
                    The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is
                    through there.

                                DADE
                    Great. Cool.
                                (pause)
                    What's your name?

                                GIRL
                    Kate. Kate Libby.

        They arrive at a classroom.

                                KATE
                    Here's your class.

                                DADE
                    My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?

                                KATE
                    No, you're not in my class.

        Kate starts away.

                                DADE
                    Give me time!

        A guy in the halls notices Dade.

                                GUY
                    Hey, you new?

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                GUY
                    Tell him about the pool, Kate.

                                DADE
                    Pool?

                                KATE
                    Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up
                    on the roof. Take the stairs over there.

                                DADE
                    Yeah! Sure.

        Kate starts away again.

                                DADE
                    Thanks!

EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP.

        Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the
        roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over
        the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.
        One of them notices Dade.

                                GEEK
                    Hey! Hold the door!

        He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.

                                Dade
                                (realizing he's been had)
                    No pool.

        Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with
        his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins
        raining.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

        Dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates
        leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls
        through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled
        in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles.

                                KATE
                    Oh my God! He found the pool.

INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB.

        The kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade
        is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to
        Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing
        skeletons.

                                TEACHER
                    I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms.
                    Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur
                    rally. I know some of you kids got computers
                    at home. But these are school property,
                    people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck
                    to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical
                    interface...

        Meanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been
        looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking
        himself into her advanced English class.

EXT. SCHOOL QUAD.

        It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The
        latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.

                                KID
                    So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,
                    eh? Academic? Purely sexual?

                                DADE
                    Homicidal?

                                KID
                    What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!

        The name rings no bells with Dade.

                                PHREAK
                    The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I
                    know you play the game.

        Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up
        to Dade and The Phantom Phreak.

                                JOEY
                    Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak,
                    dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...

                                PHREAK
                                (slaps Joey)
                    Joey, Joey...

                                JOEY
                    What? whatwhatwhat?

                                PHREAK
                    One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap
                    the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to
                    save you from yourself but you gotta stop
                    letting your mama dress you, man!
                                (To Dade):
                    Check it...

        Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer.

                                JOEY
                                (interrupting)
                    I need a handle, man. I don't have an
                    identity until I have a handle.

                                PHREAK
                    You know, you're right about that.
                                (to Dade)
                    Check it, Friday.

        Phreak hands Dade a flyer for Cyberdelia.

                                JOEY
                    Alright. How about the Master of Disaster,
                    huh?

                                PHREAK
                    You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

        Phreak walks away.

                                JOEY
                    Ultra Laser.
                                (desperate)
                    Doctor Doom!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET VILLAGE. NIGHT.

        Dade rolls in on rollerblades.  Street vendors hawk
        computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music
        vendor catches Dade's attention.

                                CEREAL
                    Check this out, each and every one of you.
                    Compilation tape, of my own making. I call
                    this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring
                    artists like, well I got some Hendrix on
                    there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all
                    great artists that asphyxiated on their own
                    vomit!

        The small crowd around him finally gets the joke.

                                CEREAL
                    Can't get this in stores, man, I made it!

        Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be
        equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the
        benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy
        techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with
        psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a
        video game with a huge screen.  Phreak is at a pay phone.

                                OPERATOR
                                (on phone)
                    Please deposit five dollars for the first
                    minute.

        Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a
        button, and the box emits a series of tones.

                                OPERATOR
                    Thank you.

                                PHREAK
                    Nonono, thank YOU!

        Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video
        game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man.
        She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the
        top-10 list.

                                DADE
                    That's a nice score for a girl.

                                KATE
                                (irritated by Dade's presence)
                    Think you can do better?

                                DADE
                    I'll give it a shot.

        Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing.
        Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet
        above.

                                CURTIS
                    Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

                                DADE
                    Sorry, can I get some room here?

                                CURTIS
                    Yeah.
                                (to Kate)
                    Why don't you come up here?

        Kate obliges and joins Curtis.  Dade continues playing.
        He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed
        chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his
        high score is about to come up.

                                CURTIS
                    He's good!

        Dade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak
        is amazed.

                                DADE
                                (to Kate)
                    Well, it looks like I'm on top.

        Kate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows.

                                PHREAK
                    Congratulations. No one's ever beat her
                    before. You just made an enemy for life.
                                (to someone else)
                    Boy meets world. Let's go?

EXT. OUTSIDE CYBERDELIA. NIGHT.

        Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy
        world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a
        little disgusted.

                                DADE
                    Who's that?

                                PHREAK
                    Curtis.

                                DADE
                    And what's he do?

                                PHREAK
                    That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks
                    slick all day.

        Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.
        Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle
        speeds off into the night.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        The clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade,
        it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the
        school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of
        the school sprinkler system for 9:30am.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDIR.

        Dade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely.
        Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade.

                                PHREAK
                    What's up?

        Dade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more
        seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire
        sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He
        realizes what is happening.

                                PHREAK
                                (amused and highly impressed)
        Oh my God. You...

        A bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the
        hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall
        cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his
        face.

                                PHREAK
                    Way cool!
                                (to Dade)
                    You saw that?

        Dade nods in the affirmative.

        Kate walks up to Dade, also understanding what has
        happened.

                                KATE
                    What the hell is going on?

                                DADE
                    Pool on the roof must have a leak.

        Kate gives Dade a look that could kill and skulks away.

        Dade walks away under his umbrella, smug and dry.

                                PHREAK
                    Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM.

        Dade, Kate, and a couple of other students are writing on
        the chalkboard. Kate finishes first.

                                KATE
                    If God gave men brains bigger than dogs',
                    they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail
                    parties.

        The class giggles.

                                KATE
                    Ruth Libby.

                                TEACHER
                    I'm not so sure your mother qualifies as a
                    significant author of the twentieth century.

                                KATE
                    Her last book sold two million copies.

                                CLASS
                                (almost in unison)
                    Woooooo!

        The teacher reads Dade's quotation.

                                TEACHER
                    "Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient
                    heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in
                    the machinery of the night."

                                DADE
                    That's Ginsburg.

                                TEACHER
                    Nice. Very nice.

                                KATE
                    He's not in this class.

                                DADE
                    I said give me time.

                                KATE
                    He's not enrolled in this class.

                                TEACHER
                    Well, he's on my list.

        Kate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the
        teacher. Dade is on it. She gives Dade another filthy
        look, both Dade and the teacher just shrug. The teacher
        moves on to Cereal.

                                TEACHER
                    "Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind
                    the most?"

                                CEREAL
                    Ozzy Osbourne!

                                TEACHER
                    You. What is your name?

        The teacher grabs the list back from Kate.

                                CEREAL
                    Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir?

                                TEACHER
                    You, however, are not on my list.

                                CEREAL
                                (in mock shock)
                    Whoa, this isn't wood shop class?

        The class cracks up. Kate and Dade exchange looks as the
        teacher escorts Cereal to the door.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    How was school?

                                DADE
                                (eating)
                    Hmmm.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    What did we learn in school today?

                                DADE
                    Revenge.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?

                                DADE
                    No. No one special.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be
                    home late.  And would you try and please fill
                    these out?

        She indicates a pile of college applications.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your
                    life.

        She starts to the door.

                                DADE
                    Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the
                    lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    And unpack.

        She leaves. Dade looks over the college applications for
        a second, and pushes them away. He'd rather not do this
        now.

INT. CYBERDELIA.

        Dade, Phreak and Joey are sitting at a table. Joey is
        giving a dull account of his hacking adventures. Enter
        Cereal.

                                CEREAL
                    FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do
                    like absolutely nothing and...

        Cereal pauses, notices Dade, whom he has never met
        formally but seen around, and then continues.

                                CEREAL
                    ...and your name goes through like seventeen
                    computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's
                    a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living
                    large. We have no names, man, no names. We
                    are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.

                    Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me.
                    I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking
                    around...

                                PHREAK
                                (to Cereal)
                    D'you bring those Crayola books?

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow.

         Cereal brings a book out of his bag.

                                CEREAL
                    Green one.

                                JOEY
                    What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What
                    are these?

                                DADE
                    International Unix Environments.

        Cereal pulls out another book.

                                CEREAL
                    Luscious orange?

        Cereal hands the orange book to Phreak.

                                DADE
                    Computer security criteria, DOD standards.

        Another book comes out.

                                DADE
                    The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So
                    called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy
                    wears on the cover.

        Another one.

                                CEREAL
                    What's that?

                                DADE
                    Devil book. The Unix Bible.

        Another one.

                                CEREAL
                    What's that?

                                DADE
                    Dragon book. Compiler design.

        Cereal brings out a large red book.

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah? What's that?

                                DADE
                    The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks.
                    Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that
                    won't fit on a shelf.

        By now Phreak has made a pile of the books, and the Red
        Book looks wholly out of place on the top of the pile.

                                JOEY
                    Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm
                    in this computer, right. So I'm looking
                    around, looking around, you know, throwing
                    commands at it, I don't know where it is or
                    what it does or anything. It's like, it's
                    like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like
                    four hours I'm just messing around in there.
                    Finally I figure out, that it's a bank.
                    Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this
                    morning, I look in the paper, some cash
                    machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out
                    seven hundred dollars into the middle of the
                    street.

                                CEREAL
                    That's kinda cool.

                                JOEY
                    That was me. That was me. I did that.

                                DADE
                    You did this from your house.

        Joey takes a drag from his cigarette and just nods, with a
        big grin on his face.

                                PHREAK
                    What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't
                    hack a bank across state lines from your
                    house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where
                    are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know
                    anything?

                                CEREAL
                    Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.

                                JOEY
                    You guys always think I should know
                    everything, and you never tell me anything.
                    Am I right?

                                PHREAK
                    Alright, what are the three most commonly used
                    passwords?

                                JOEY
                    Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that
                    order, necessarily, right?

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah but don't forget God. System operators
                    love to use God. It's that whole male ego
                    thing.

                                PHREAK
                    Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
                    righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,
                    you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,
                    supercomputers they use to like, do physics,
                    and look for oil and stuff?

                                PHREAK
                    Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The
                    big iron?

                                DADE
                    Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy
                    metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some
                    low security, and try the back door.

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah but oh man,
                                (starts rubbing one of his
                                own nipples in mock sexual
                                excitement)
                    wouldn't you just love to get one of those
                    Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!

                                PHREAK
                    Yo, who ate all of my fries?

        Cereal pauses a second.

                                CEREAL
                                (pretending to be enraged)
                    Joey?!

                                JOEY
                    What, no, nonononono, I didn't touch your
                    fries. I did not touch your fries.

                                PHREAK
                    Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.

                                CEREAL
                    It was him, man!

                                PHREAK
                    You're psyched. You need to lay off of that
                    shit.

                                CEREAL
                                (to Joey)
                    I'm gonna hit you!

INT. JOEY'S ROOM. NIGHT.

        Joey is hacking. A Gibson. He gets in. Using GOD as a
        password. Nice graphics represent the machine's vast
        systems.

                                JOEY
                    YES! Home run, home run. You and me Lucy.
                    We're gonna show em baby.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.

        A system operator at Ellingson Mineral Corporation, a
        large oil company, notices the intrusion. He gets on the
        phone.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        The place is a mess, typical of the hacker bachelor pad.
        Empty chinese food boxes and Jolt Cola cans litter the
        place.

        Plague's phone is ringing, waking him.

                                HAL

                                HAL
                    Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's
                    happening on the net.

                                PLAGUE
                    As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

                                HAL
                    Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson
                    is working really hard. We got one person
                    online, the workload is enough for like ten
                    users. I think we've got a hacker.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

                                JOEY
                    Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here.
                    Right, uh...

        Joey starts looking for something to download as proof he
        was there.

                                JOEY
                    Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.

        He selects a Garbage file and starts the download. His
        screen becomes a psychedelic mind trip.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.

        The Plague glides in on a skateboard. Short and thin,
        bearded, about 35 but still trying to be a teenage
        anarchist, yet not consciously realizing he sold out that
        ideal years ago.

                                PLAGUE
                    Never fear. I is here.

                                HAL
                    I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.

                    Let's echo 23, see what's up.

        The huge monitor lights up with the display of the
        Gibson's resources. Hal and the Plague watch. Plague
        starts "surfing" around.

                                PLAGUE
                    "God" wouldn't be up this late.

        He sees what Joey is downloading. A file called
        "Garbage".

                                PLAGUE
                    Shit! Get me the switching control center.

        He puts on a telephone headset. Hal dials for him.

                                PLAGUE
                                (into the headset)
                    I need to trace a call that's in progress.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

        Joey is sneaking a cigarette while his computer downloads.
        There is a knock at the door. It's his mother.

                                JOEY
                                (whispering)
                    Shit!
                                (loudly, panicked)
                    Uh yeah... hold on, mom. Hold on one second.

        He puts out the cigarette and sprays the room with air
        freshener.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    I mean it! Open the door, Joseph.

                                JOEY
                    Yeah, uh, yeah, okay.

        He unlocks the door. Joey's mom bursts in. He's still
        clambering into bed.

                                JOEY
                    There you go.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    Bed. Sleep. Now!

        She turns off the computer. It wasn't finished
        downloading.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    Sweet dreams, Joey.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM. DARK.

        Joey takes a disk out of his computer and stashes it in an
        air vent in the cieling.

INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY.

        Phreak, Dade and Cereal are rollerblading through the
        halls of an apartment building that is filled with
        graffiti. It appears that most of the spray-bomb art was
        created by the residents.

                                CEREAL
                    Nice place, huh.

        Cereal knocks on a door spray-painted "Hackstock"

                                DADE
                    You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You
                    know who he is?

                                (to Cereal)
                    Do you?

        Cereal shrugs.

        A hooded black man in his early twenties answers the door.

                                PHREAK
                    Nikon! Lord Nikon this is...

        Phreak motions to Dade.

                                DADE
                    No.

        Nikon slams the door.

                                PHREAK
                    Come on!

        Phreak knocks the door again. Nikon opens again.

                                NIKON
                    What, your mom buy you a 'Puter for Christmas?
                                (to Phreak)
                    Does he know anything?

                    Yeah sure.

        Nikon and Cereal do a fake Kung-fu move together.

                                SUIT #1
                    Now, you're sure about that, Mr. The Plague?

                                PLAGUE
                    Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100
                    percent. Okay?

                                SUIT #2
                    Yeah.

                                SUIT #1
                    Okay.

                                PLAGUE
                    We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.

        The suits get off the escalator, Plague and Margo take the
        next one down.

                                MARGO
                    What the hell was that all about?

                                PLAGUE
                    I had to move fast. The hacker copied my
                    garbage file.

                                MARGO
                    What?

                                PLAGUE
                    I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in
                    the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the
                    hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we
                    can't do on our own.

                                MARGO
                    I don't want to go to jail for this.

                                PLAGUE
                    Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.

                                MARGO
                    But you've created a virus that's going to
                    cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to
                    arrest some hacker kid?

                                PLAGUE
                    Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.

                                MARGO
                    Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...

                                PLAGUE
                    Sh, sh sh sh sh.

        Plague stops a passing secretary and snatches a piece of
        paper from her hand.

                                PLAGUE
                    I'll take care of this.

                                SECRETARY
                    Alright, sir.

                                PLAGUE
                    I can cancel it any time. I don't need any
                    program code. But it's the perfect cover, to
                    confiscate the disc and find out how much of
                    that garbage file has been copied.

                                MARGO
                    Get it!
                                (walking away)
                    Why did I ever trust you?
                                (going back up the escalator)
                    Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your
                    toys.

INT. SECRET SERVICE INTERROGATION ROOM.

        Joey is distraught over the dismantling of Lucy. Agent
        Ray examines the Mac's innards.

                                GILL
                    Did you find the program for the virus on any
                    of the discs we confiscated?

                                PLAGUE
                    No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

                                GILL
                    Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an
                    accomplice. We'll release him until his
                    indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see
                    if he leads us to your disc.

EXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE.

        Joey's apartment building is an L-shaped skyscraper about
        30 storeys high, unimpressive by New York City standards.
        Two Secret Service agents are staking Joey out in a car
        outside.

                                SECRET SERVICE AGENT BOB
                    Unit 3 outside suspect Joey Pardella's
                    apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still
                    grounded... by his mother.

        His radio crackles.

                                AGENT BOB
                    Listen to this bullshit.
                                (he reads)
                    "This is our world now. The world of the
                    electron and the switch, the beauty of the
                    baud. We exist without nationality, skin
                    color, or religious bias. You wage wars,
                    murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us
                    believe it's for our own good, yet we're the
                    criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is
                    that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is
                    my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You
                    may stop me, but you can't stop us all."

                                AGENT RAY
                    Now that's cool.

                                AGENT BOB
                    Cool?

                                AGENT RAY
                    Yeah, cool.

                                AGENT BOB
                    You think it's cool?

                                AGENT RAY
                                (not caring for where Bob is going
                                with this)
                    It's cool!

                                AGENT BOB
                    It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!

INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.

        Dade, Cereal and Phreak check their faces. Cereal brushes
        his teeth.

                                CEREAL
                                (to Phreak)
                    So what do you think, can I crash at your
                    place tonight?

                                DADE
                    What is it with this guy?

                                PHREAK
                    His parents missed Woodstock and he's been
                    making up for it since. Hey, you hear about
                    Joey's bust?

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah. Probably had something to do with that
                    bank in Idaho.

                                PHREAK
                    Do you think he could hack a Gibson?

                                DADE
                    Did you talk to him?

                                PHREAK
                    Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next
                    three lifetimes.
                                (imitating her)
                    He isn't to consort with his computer friends.
                                (himself again)
                    The secret service is really out to get him.
                                (changes the subject)
                    Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?

        Dade shakes his head.

                                PHREAK
                    It's at Kate's...

        Dade just smiles.

                                PHREAK
                     Thought so!

        Cereal and Phreak leave, Cereal dancing.

INT. PLAGUE'S OFFICE.

        Plague is wearing a VR helmet and gloves, playing some
        sort of action game. He is unaware that Gill has just
        entered the room.

                                GILL
                    What the hell are you doing? Plague!

        He thumps the VR pedestal.

                                GILL
                    PLAGUE!

        Plague finally notices, and takes off the helmet.

                                PLAGUE
                    Gill.

                                GILL
                    I think we've got something.

        Gill hands Plague a folder. It has the logo of Stanton High.

                                PLAGUE
                    Uuugh, hard copy.

        Plague looks it over and recognizes a name.

                                PLAGUE
                    Dade Murphy.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        It's after school. Dade's just unlocking the front door,
        only to find a Secret Service agent behind it.  And one
        behind him in the hallway. Both point pistols at him.

                                AGENT RAY
                    Secret Service!

                                AGENT BOB
                    Don't move!

        They slam Dade against a wall and start frisking him.

                                DADE
                    Christ! What is the...

                                AGENT BOB
                    Shut up!

                                DADE
                    What are you doing, man? Get off me!

        They lead him into his room and throw him down on the bed.
        Plague is there.

                                AGENT BOB
        Just sit in the bed and keep your hands where we can see
        them.

                                PLAGUE
                    The year was 1988.  And this nasty virus
                    crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.

        Dade has a flashback.

                                DADE
                    Fifteen hundred and seven.

                                (astounded)
                    Wow, huh!

                                GILL
                    It got you seven years probation. No
                    computer, couldn't even use a touch tone
                    phone.

                                PLAGUE
                    Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?
                                (getting to the point)
                    A virus has been planted in the Ellingson
                    Mineral computer system. You were our prime
                    suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found
                    no trace of it.

                                GILL
                    However, we have come to believe that one Joey
                    Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.
                    He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that
                    Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We
                    want you to help us find it.

                                PLAGUE
                    Gill.

        The three secret service agents leave Plague and Dade
        alone.  Plague shuts the door behind them.

                    I can't believe you were only eleven when you
                    wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus.
                    Dade, I know how you might feel about narking
                    on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us,
                    there's no such thing as family and friends.
                    We're each our own country, with temporary
                    allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty
                    with you.

                                DADE
                    I'm sorry. Who are you?

                                PLAGUE
                    I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we
                    be allies?

                                DADE
                    Nah. I don't play well with others.

        Plague is holding Dade's baseball bat. He shrugs, turns
        around, and smashes Dade's stereo to smithereens.

                                DADE
                    Shit! Come on!

                                PLAGUE
                    Watch which friends you do play with. A
                    record like yours could land you in jail, get
                    you kicked out of school, no colleges would
                    take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and
                    everything you love.

        Plague replaces the baseball bat.

                                PLAGUE
                    I'll be in touch.

                    Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?

                                DADE

INT. DADE'S ROOM. LATER.

        Dade is lying in bed. A door opens. It's Kate. She opens
        her motorcycle jacket, revealing her bare breasts. Dade
        starts to get up, she pushes him back own on the bed and
        starts kissing him passionately. He responds in kind.
        Then, Gill, Agent Ray and Agent Bob burst into the room,
        handcuff him, break the two up and haul them away as
        Plague looks on smugly.

        Then Dade wakes up in a sweat.  It was only a dream. He
        regains his composure.  The sound of New York City at
        night surrounds him. He goes back to sleep.

INT. KATE'S PLACE.

        The party. A large, well-furnished apartment in an
        elegant old skyscraper in the fashionable part of town.
        Teenagers dance and writhe to loud, bassy music. Dade and
        Phreak arrive.

                                PHREAK
                    Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help
                    books for women. Stuff like "Women Who Love
                    Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae"

        Phreak shows Dade the book.

                                DADE
                    That explains a lot.

        Kate, the lovely and gracious hostess, mingles and greets
        her many guests, not noticing Dade or Phreak. Cereal
        offers Dade a drink from a plastic bottle. Dade, not
        knowing what he's in for, drinks. Nikon is the Deejay.

                                (loudly)
                    Yo, what's up Nikon!

                                NIKON
                    Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it.
                                (to Cereal)
                    Houston, we have liftoff, 3 o'clock,
                    check it... don't look right away, what's
                    wrong with you! Look at her man...

        Nikon and Cereal are checking out a truly fine babe.

                                NIKON
                                (concentrating)
                    Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St.,
                    apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!

                                DADE
                    How did you know that?

                                NIKON
                    I got photographic memory.
                                (Smiling)
                    It's a curse!
                                (Into the crowd)
                    Lisa!

                                LISA
                    Hey, how do you know my name?

        Cereal and Phreak move through the crowd. Cereal notices
        something.

                                CEREAL
                    Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's
                    a privilege, not a right!

INT. MEETING HALL.

        A 12-step recovery group. Addicts, including Joey
        Pardella, sit in a semi-circle.

                                VICKIE
                    Hi, my name is Vickie, and I'm an addict.

                                HANK
                    Hi, my name is Hank, and uh, I'm an addict.

                                JOEY
                                (smoking)
                    Uh, my name's Joey but, uh, I'm not an addict.

        Joey takes a drag. The group reacts indignantly.

                                JOEY
                    Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this.
                    I got in trouble with my computer, right,
                    okay, and my lawyer told the judge that I'm an
                    addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer!
                    No really, really,

        Joey takes another drag.

                                JOEY
                    I'm not an addict. I'm not, I'm not.

        Joey downs his coffee.

                                JOEY
                    Can I get some more coffee?

INT. KATE'S BEDROOM.

        Phreak is checking out Kate's computer.

                                PHREAK
                    Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely
                    great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!

                                DADE
                    Yeah? Display?

                                CEREAL
                    Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic
                    colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!

                                NIKON
                    I want it.

                                PHREAK
                    I want it to have my children!

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.

                                PHREAK
                    Yo, hit the lights.

                    Dade hits the lights. The four ooo and ahh at
                    its graphics. Kate and Curtis walk into the
                    room and hit the bed, unaware of the hackers
                    in the corner by her laptop.

                                DADE
                                (whispering)
                    Shit!

                                CEREAL
                    Shh!

                                DADE
                    Was that her top?

                                PHREAK
                    One-handed!

                                NIKON
                    Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her
                    software!

                                DADE
                                (loudly)
                    Burn!

        Their cover is blown.

                                NIKON
                    What the f...

        Cereal hides under the desk.

                                KATE
                    Hey! What are you guys doing in here?

                                PHREAK
                    I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your
                    fly laptop!

                                NIKON
                    Yeah, it's hyped, you know... you're in the
                    butter zone now, baby.

                                PHREAK
                                (smiling)
                    Uh-huh!

                                KATE
                                (her tone changing)
                    Yeah, it is...
                                (she comes over to it)
                    I wanna triple the RAM...

                                CURTIS
                    Oooh, Leopard Boy... AND the Decepticons. Uh,
                    Kate, Kate, you're not going into that
                    computer shit now, right?

        Kate barely acknowledges him.

                                CURTIS
                                (cynically)
                    Humm, yeah.

        Curtis leaves.

                                CEREAL
                                (mockingly)
                    Right.

                                DADE
                    The sensitive type.

        Kate finally notices that Dade, whom she didn't invite, is at her
        party and in her bedroom.

                                KATE
                    What is he doing in here?

                                PHREAK
                    Relax, Burn, he's my guest.

                                DADE
                    Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of
                    OTV!

                                KATE
                    What?

                                DADE
                    I'm Crash Override.

                                KATE
                    You're the moron that's been invading my turf?

                                CEREAL
                    Whoa, whowhowhowhoa.
                                (motioning to Dade)
                    Crash...
                                (motioning to Kate)
                    and Burn!

        Cereal breaks into hysterics.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        Plague is hacking.

                                MARGO
                    Murphy kid turn you down?

                                PLAGUE
                                (in a hammy southern accent)
                    I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper
                    and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

                                MARGO
                    Pervert! What are you talking about?

        She turns her back to him. He does up the zipper on her
        dress. Their relationship becomes apparent.

                                PLAGUE
                    The FBI computer holds files on twenty million
                    Americans.  I just hacked into it.

                                MARGO
                    Congratulations.

                                PLAGUE
                    From here I got access to every piece of data
                    ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His
                    parents separated five years ago, reconciled
                    two years later, filed for divorce last year,
                    custody battle, boy chose to go with his
                    mother. Hmm.

                                MARGO
                    So?

                                PLAGUE
                    So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

INT. KATE'S ROOM.

        Kate's room is empty, and Dade can't resist going back in
        to play with her laptop, which far outclasses his own,
        some more. On the balcony, Kate notices and comes back
        in.

                                KATE
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                DADE
                    It's cool, I'm just looking.

                                KATE
                    It's too much machine for you.

                                DADE
                    Yeah?

        Dade starts working furiously on it.

                                KATE
                    I hope you don't screw like you type.

        Dade slows to a two-finger keypoke, not missing a beat.

                                DADE
                    It has a killer refresh rate.

                                KATE
                    P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

                                DADE
                    Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI
                    bus. But you knew that.

                                KATE
                    Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change
                    everything.

                                DADE
                    Yeah. RISC is good.

        They uncomfortably exchange glances.

                                DADE
                    You sure this sweet machine's not going to
                    waste?

                                KATE
                    Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the
                    Best, Die Like the Rest?"

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                KATE
                    Are you challenging me?

                                DADE
                    Name your stakes.

                                KATE
                    If I win, you become my slave.

                                DADE
                                (intrigued)
                    Your slave?

                                KATE
                                (realizing his mind is in the
                                gutter)
                    You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack
                    copyrights, whatever I want.

                                DADE
                    And if I win?

                                KATE
                                (giggles)
                    Make it my first born.

                                DADE
                    Make it our first date.

                                KATE
                    You're not gonna win.

                                DADE
                    And you have to smile.

                                KATE
                    I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so
                    you're on.

MONTAGE: Scenes of Dade and Kate preparing for the challenge.

                                PHREAK
                                (voice over)
                    So here's the deal. The chosen contest: To
                    hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill, and
                    get one back for Joey.

        Dade spray paints camouflage onto his keyboard.

                                NIKON
                    Our decisions are final, by a vote of 2 to 1.
                    No appeals.

        Kate rifles through her address book.

                                CEREAL
                    The duel will last until we declare a winner.

        Dade plays quick-draw with disks.

                                PHREAK
                    Use only the dialups, access codes and
                    passwords in your collection. Can't ask for
                    any help from us.

        Dade, having mastered the quick-disk-draw in the mirror,
        looks satisfied.

                                DADE
                                (into mirror)
                    Talking to me?

        All five are together at the beginning of the challenge.

                                PHREAK
                    Any questions?

                                KATE
                    Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?

        Dade and Kate shake hands and the challenge begins.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.

        At a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks
        up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out.
        "Destroy Card" is the final instruction. The other
        hackers look on.

INT. RESTAURANT.

        A waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine,
        sees the message and returns to the patron's table. It is
        Richard Gill. Right there, the waiter chops the
        MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's
        horror.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.

        Dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and
        changes an ad.

                                KATE
                    Alright, he's in the personal ads.
                                (reading Dade's ad)
                    "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking
                    for discreet friend to bring dreams to
                    reality. Leather, lace, and water sports.
                    Transvestites welcome."

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.

        At his office, Gill is on the speaker phone with someone
        responding to the ad.

                                GILL
                    I... I... I know where you can stick it... I
                    know where you can stick it...

        Gill punches a button on the phone, another caller comes
        on.

                                CALLER
                    ...wanna lick your earlobes... I wanna lick
                    your lips... I wanna lick your toes... I
                    wanna lick your ankles...

                                GILL
                    Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this.

        Gill punches another button, another caller comes on.

                                CALLER
                    That's why they call me Stallion...

                                GILL
                    Aw, that's disgusting!

        Gill punches another button.

                                CALLER
                    My heart is steaming for you...

        Gill punches another button. He is becoming quite flustered.

                                CALLER
                    ...spank you with my...

                                GILL
                    Aww, Spank your ass...

        He punches another button.

        Another caller comes on, and Gill hangs up the phone,
        disgusted, offended, and distraught. The Plague is there,
        witnessing the whole thing.

                                PLAGUE
                    Animal!

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BULDING OBSERVATION DECK.

        It's Kate's turn. Kate is hacking into the Department of
        Motor Vehicles. She adds 113 traffic violations and DUI
        offender status to Gill's record.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY, BUSY STREET.

        Gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a NYC police
        grunt.  He is thrown onto the hood of his car and
        handcuffed.

                                GILL
                     Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you
                     know who I am?

EXT. CHINATOWN, PUBLIC PHONE.

        Dade's turn. He hacks into the Secret Service's personnel
        file, and changes Gill's status to "Deceased."

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.

                                EMPLOYEE
                                (on phone)
                    This is accounting, sir. You enquired about
                    an employee of ours, an Agent Richard Gill?

                                GILL
                    Yes.

                                EMPLOYEE
                    Our records indicate he's deceased.

                                GILL
                    I'm what?

INT. CYBERDELIA.

        The five are playing pool.

                                DADE
                    Dead.

                                PHREAK
                    Dead?

                                DADE
                    Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.

                                NIKON
                    Very impressive.

                                CEREAL
                    Super hero like even.

                                KATE
                    Yeah, whatever. What's the score?

        Phreak clicks the pool scoreboard so it says 60 - 60.

                                PHREAK
                    Tie.

        The other four protest.

                                PHREAK
                    Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and
                    everything, I guess you two will have to
                    improvise the next round.

                                DADE
                    Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our
                    date.

                                KATE
                    And if I win, so do you.

        Dade thinks about it a second.

                                DADE
                    Deal.

        Kate gives Dade a look that says "I'm going to hold you to
        that."

INT. KATE'S BED. NIGHT.

        A shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a
        zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands
        caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body
        belongs to Dade Murphy.

        Kate wakes up gasping.  It was only a dream. She pants
        and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed
        that dream.

                                KATE
                    Oooohhhh...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY.

                    Kate, at her locker, stops Dade.

                                KATE
                    Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.

        She opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and
        bikini bottom.

                                KATE
                    You are man enough to stick with the deal,
                    aren't you?

        Dade walks off.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        Dade signs an electronic pad for a package from UPS. He
        takes the package.

                                DADE
                    Thanks.

        He closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop
        computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very
        high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns
        it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks.

                                PLAGUE
                    You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well
                    let me explain the New World Order.
                    Governments and corporations need people like
                    you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard
                    cowboys. And all those other people out there
                    who have no idea what's going on are the
                    cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my
                    help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh,
                    think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"!
                    Tell me where the disk is.

        Plague's face vanishes.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

        Joey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking
        despondent. His mother enters.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not
                    grounded anymore.

        She kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to
        life, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it
        in the air vent.

EXT. PARK.

        Joey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives.
        Agents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out.

                                PHREAK
                    Yo, what's up?

                                JOEY
                    Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute,
                    listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file
                    from...

                                PHREAK
                    Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it,
                    Joey, come on.

                                JOEY
                    Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.

                                PHREAK
                    Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.
                    Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.

                                JOEY
                    I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're
                    asking me about it, alright? Will you take a
                    look for me?

        Joey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,
        and Phreak notices.

                                PHREAK
                    Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.

        Joey sees, and runs for it.

                                JOEY
                    Shit!

        The agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after
        Phreak.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.

        Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a
        condom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it
        there with gum.

INT. PHREAK'S ROOM.

        Phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking
        career. He knows he's about to be busted.

DREAM SEQUENCE.

        The Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak. He
        still hasn't destroyed any records, and starts manically
        going through everything. Gill is on his laptop screen.

                                GILL
                    I'm watching you...

INT. PHREAK'S ROOM. MORNING.

        A knock on the door. Phreak awakes. It's his mother.

                                PHREAK'S MOM
                    Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano.
                    Time for school, come on.

        The secret service bursts in through the window just as
        Phreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps
        to his feet.

                                AGENT
                    Secret Service, don't move!

                                PHREAK
                    Deja vu!

                                AGENT BOB
                    Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the
                    Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

        Phreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping
        Phreak, cursing in Spanish.

                                PHREAK
                    What are you waiting for, arrest me already!

INT. POLICE STATION LOCKUP.

        The undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened
        thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he
        is led to his one phone call.

                                COP
                    You get one call. Uno. Understand?

        The cop locks the dial on the phone.

        Phreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He
        starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a
        ringing tone.

                                OPERATOR
                    Hello, operator services.

                                PHREAK
                    Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a
                    number.

                                OPERATOR
                    What number please?

                                PHREAK
                    555-4202.

                                OPERATOR
                    Just one moment.

                                PHREAK
                    Thank you.

        Kate answers.

                                KATE
                    Hello?

                                PHREAK
                    Hey, it's me.

                                KATE
                    Phreak?

                                PHREAK
                    I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He
                    really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the
                    disc with a file he copied and now I'm in
                    jail! They're charging me with some serious
                    shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do,
                    like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and
                    they keep asking about you guys.

                                KATE
                    You think they're going to bust us?

                                PHREAK
                    Yeah! You better figure out what's on that
                    disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that
                    place where I put that thing that time?

        He hangs up just as the cop returns.

INT. SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.

        Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the
        boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the
        condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from
        the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        Kate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Hi!
                                (looking Kate over)
                    Well, now I see what all the fuss is about.
                                (she shows them to Dade's room)
                    Dade... you have company.

                                CEREAL
                    It's a nice room.

                                KATE
                    We need your help.

                                DADE
                    Do my ears deceive me?

        Kate starts to leave.

                                CEREAL
                    Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got
                    a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up
                    call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand
                    free access to data, well, it comes with some
                    responsibility. When I was a child, I spake
                    as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
                    as a child, but when I became a man I put away
                    childish things.
                                (pause)
                    What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse
                    11, no duh. Come on.

                                KATE
                    Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need
                    your help to figure out what's on this disc.

                                DADE
                    I can't. Everybody who touches that thing
                    gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested,
                    I'm sorry.

                                CEREAL
                    Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or
                    something.

        Cereal leaves the room.

                                KATE
                    What is it with you? I know we've been
                    playing games, but, we're supposed to be on
                    the same side and we really need your help. I
                    really need your help.

                                DADE
                    I'm sorry, I can't.

                                KATE
                    Well, could you just make a copy of the disc?
                    And just hide it in case we get busted, so we
                    have something to give our lawyers, something
                    that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do
                    that?

        A knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in
                    the fridge. Cereal has.

        She leaves.

                                KATE
                                (to Mrs. Murphy)
                    Thank you.

                                DADE
                    Okay. I'll copy it.

                                KATE
                    Okay, thank you.

        Later.  Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's
        records on his screen.

                                PLAGUE
                    The girl. The girl has the disc I need.

                                DADE
                    I told you, I don't play well with others.

                                PLAGUE
                    Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a
                    file.

        Dade does.

        An extensive criminal record with a strange woman's
        picture comes up. The strange woman transforms into
        Dade's mother.

                                PLAGUE
                    Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the
                    state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement,
                    two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.
                    When she's arrested, she will not have a
                    trial, she will not pass go, she will go
                    directly to jail. Then I change this file
                    back to the original, and your mom disappears.

                                DADE
                    That's bullshit.

                                PLAGUE
                    What can I tell you. Computers never lie,
                    kid. Your mom will be arrested at work,
                    she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip
                    searched.

                                DADE
                    You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.

                                PLAGUE
                    Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse
                    things than death and, uh, I can do all of
                    them!

        Dade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked
        mother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over
        her.

EXT. PUBLIC PHONE, WET STREET, NIGHT.

        Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.

                                PLAGUE
                    Talk to me.

                                DADE
                    I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's
                    on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it
                    out. She's not the one who planted the virus.
                    You leave her alone.

                                PLAGUE
                    Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,
                    she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?

        Dade hangs up and waits for some time.  A limousine drives
        by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,
        jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase
        but gives up quickly.

INT. KATE'S ROOM.

        Dade shows up.  Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the
        disc.

                                DADE
                    Kate, listen.

                                KATE
                    Uh, hold on...

                                DADE
                    I have to tell you something.

                                CEREAL
                    Hold on a second!

                                NIKON
                    Look at this, it's so lean and clean.

                                CEREAL
                    Looks like a hacker wrote it.

                                KATE
                    Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.

        Nikon points out part of the code.

                                NIKON
                    But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This
                    is taking forever and a day to figure out.
                    I'm gonna make some coffee.

        Dade takes Nikon's place.

                                CEREAL
                    Tag, you're in.

        Hours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the
        garbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about
        anything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of
        half-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement.

                                DADE
                    This isn't a virus. It's a worm!

                                NIKON
                    What's this one eat?

                                DADE
                    It nibbles. You see this?

        Dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.

                                DADE
                    This is every financial transaction Ellingson
                    conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to
                    the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.

                                KATE
                    The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.

                                DADE
                    And no one's caught it because the money isn't
                    really gone. It's just data being shifted
                    around.

                                KATE
                    Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out
                    with the money and erases its tracks.

                                DADE
                    Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
                    Check it out. By this point, it's already
                    running at, what, twice the speed as when it
                    started.

                                KATE
                    Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...

                                NIKON
                    Two days.

                                DADE
                    And judging by this segment alone, it's
                    already eaten about...

                                CEREAL
                    21.8 million bucks, man.

        Nikon whistles.

                                KATE
                    Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the
                    fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and
                    that's us. We've got to get the rest of the
                    file, so we can find out where the money is
                    going before the worm disappears, so we can
                    find out WHO created it.

                                DADE
                    I know, I know who wrote it.

                                KATE
                    What?

                                DADE
                    This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a
                    copy of the disc you gave me.

                                KATE
                    You what?

                                DADE
                    I didn't know what was on it.

                                CEREAL
                                (agitated)
                    Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!

                                NIKON
                    Yo, man, you an amateur, man.

                                KATE
                    Why did he come to you?

                                DADE
                    I got a record. I was Zero Cool.

                                NIKON
                    Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven
                    systems in one day?

        Nikon closes his eyes and access his photographic memory.

                                NIKON
                    Biggest crash in history, front page, New

                    you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero
                    Cool! Oh, shit!

                                CEREAL
                    That's far out!

                                NIKON
                    This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!

                                KATE
                                (coldly)
                    Well that's great. There goes MIT.

                                DADE
                    I'll make it up to you!

                                KATE
                    How?

                                DADE
                    I'll hack the Gibson.

                                NIKON
                    They'll trace you like that
                                (snaps his fingers)
                    man, cops are gonna find you, they're
                    gonna find you with a smoking gun.

                                DADE
                    Fucked if I care, man.

                                NIKON
                    Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll
                    take you ten minutes to get in, and you've
                    still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the
                    cops will have you in... five minutes.

                    Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help,
                    we can do it in five minutes, man.

                                DADE
                    Okay. Let's go shopping.

                                CEREAL
                    Woo hoo! Boom!

EXT. OUTSIDE ELLINGSON BUILDING.

        Dade and Kate cut through a chain link fence and jump into
        a dumpster at Ellingson. Kate lands on Dade.

                                DADE
                    You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of
                    honor, I might take advantage of this
                    situation.  Erotically, as it were.

        Kate fishes around in her pants, never breaking eye
        contact with Dade. She pulls out a flashlight. They
        start trashing. They get up to leave and are spotted by a
        security guard.

                                GUARD
                    Alright, hold it right there!

        Kate pulls out a flare gun and fires it at the security
        guard.  He ducks.

                                DADE
                    Shit!!

                                KATE
                    It's my subway defense system.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET.

        Nikon is staring down a manhole, Cereal is fishing through
        an adjacent phone company truck.

                                NIKON
                    He's way down there.

        Cereal emerges with a beltload of equipment and a hard hat.
        But he forgot the most important thing.

                                CEREAL
                    Ta-da!

                                NIKON
                    Yo, brain dead, the manual!

        Cereal goes back to the truck and gets a thick manual. The
        phone company technician comes up from the manhole.

                                PHONE COMPANY TECH
                    Hey!

                                CEREAL AND NIKON
                                (in unison, pointing down the street)
                    TRUCK!!!

        The phone company tech jumps back in the hole, Cereal and
        Nikon take off.

INT. SECRET SERVICE BULDING.

        A woman is seated at the desk.  Agent Gill walks by.

                                WOMAN
                    Find it?

        Cereal emerges from the desk, between her legs. His tool
        belt dangles obscenely from his crotch.

                                CEREAL
                    Phone's alright. The problem must be
                    somewhere else.

        Cereal walks away with his buttcrack seriously showing.

INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL OFFICES.

        Nikon poses as a flower delivery boy. He winds his way
        through the offices of Ellingson Mineral, "shoulder
        surfing", watching the workers entering passwords. His
        photographic memory captures everything.  The Plague walks
        past him, noticing briefly but not making the connection.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        The Da Vinci virus' launch/cancel prompt is up.

                                MARGO
                                (pacing)
                    They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
                    How much do they know?

                                PLAGUE
                    Not everything. But enough to implicate us.

                                MARGO
                    You said the worm was untreaceable!

                                PLAGUE
                    Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers.
                    But don't worry. All we have to do is launch
                    the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be
                    put away.

                                MARGO
                    Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!

                                PLAGUE
                    No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the
                    time they realize the truth, we'll be long
                    gone with all of our money.

        Margo starts to protest.

                                PLAGUE
                    Look, there is no right and wrong.  There is
                    only fun and boring. A thirty year prison
                    sentence sounds pretty dull to me.  Who do you
                    prefer serves it, us? Or them?

        Plague clicks on "Launch". The virus repeats its demand.

                                VIRUS
                    Unless five million dollars are transferred to
                    the following numbered account in seven days,
                    I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
                    fleet.

EXT. OPEN SEA.

        As the virus speaks, a supertanker sails on a choppy sea.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        Plague leaves a message on Gill's answering machine.

                                PLAGUE
                                (sternly)
                    The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30,
                    and those hackers tried to get into our system
                    again. At this point I insist you take more
                    strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will
                    hold the Secret Service responsible.

        Gill gets on the phone.

                                GILL
                                (grimly)
                    Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias
                    Acid Burn, Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal
                    Killer, Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override,
                    also known as Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias
                    Lord Nikon. We pick them up tomorrow morning
                    at nine o'clock.

        As Gill gives the order, a mysterious device under his
        desk blinks. Cereal put it there.

INT. NIKON'S PLACE.

        Nikon and Cereal taped Gill's orders.

                                CEREAL
                    Snoop onto them...

                                NIKON
                    ...as they snoop onto us.

        Nikon calls Kate.

                                KATE
                    Yeah, it's Kate.

                                NIKON
                    Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.

INT. SUBWAY.

        Cereal, Nikon, Dade and Kate skate through a run down
        subway platform and get on the "A" Train. They go over
        the results of their password gathering spree.

                                KATE
                    Alright, so what have we got?

                                DADE
                    Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever
                    Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.

                                NIKON
                    Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how
                    many but... my head hurts.

                                CEREAL
                    Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the
                    Da Vinci virus?

                                DADE
                    What?

                                CEREAL
                    Check this out. It's a memo about how they're
                    gonna deal with those oil spills that happened
                    on the fourteenth.

                                KATE
                    What oil spills?

                                NIKON
                    Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the
                    thirteenth.

                                CEREAL
                    Well this hasn't happened yet.

                                KATE
                    Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same
                    day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci
                    virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was
                    being charged with? Look...
                                (quotes the memo)
                    "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson
                    tankers" - they blame hackers!

                                NIKON
                                (angry)
                    Damn!

                                CEREAL
                    A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.

        Kate gets ready to get off the subway.

                                NIKON
                    Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, where are you going,
                    huh?

                                KATE
                    I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right,
                    till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm
                    gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay?
                                (to Dade)
                    Are you coming?

        Dade gets up.

                                CEREAL
                    May the Force be with you, man.

INT. INDUSTRIAL DANCE CLUB.

        Weird music plays, lots of weird people dance.  Razor and
        Blade are on stage, dancing in front of a huge speaker.

                                KATE
                    There they are!

                                DADE
                    Razor and Blade! They're flakes!

                                KATE
                    They're elite! Let's get 'em.

        Dade and Kate push through the crowd. The song changes to
        a fast industrial rap number, Razor and Blade leave the
        stage, and Dade starts getting moshed. He climbs on the
        stage to follow Razor and Blade. For his trouble, he is
        thrown back onto the crowd, who pass him around overhead.

        Finally the crowd lets him go.  He catches up with Kate.

                                KATE
                    I lost 'em. Where were you?

        Dade tries to explain, but is at a loss for words.

        They make their way to the entrance to Razor and Blade's
        lair. Video monitors are everywhere.

                                DADE
                    I don't like this.

        A robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at
        Dade.

                                DADE
                    AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this!

                                BLADE
                                (through video intercom)
                    What do you want?

                                DADE
                    Ummm... we come in peace?

        Dade winces at his own corniness.

                                KATE
                    We need your help.  If you're up to it.

                                RAZOR
                    She's buff. Ballsy.

                                BLADE
                    Let's keep her.

                                RAZOR
                    Waste the dude.

        The gun goes off. It's only a cigarette lighter! No one
        can accuse Razor and Blade of not having a sense of humor.

INT. RAZOR AND BLADE'S PLACE.

                                KATE
                    A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills
                    at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.

                                DADE
                    It's somehow connected with the worm that's
                    stealing the money.

                                KATE
                    We need your help to overload the Gibson so we
                    can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the
                    worm program.

                                RAZOR
                    She's rabid, but cute.

                                BLADE
                    See, we're very busy. A TV network that
                    wishes to remain nameless has expressed an
                    interest in our show.

                                DADE
                                (noticing the stench of sellout)
                    Let's go, Kate.

                                RAZOR
                    Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to
                    need more than just two media icons like us.
                    You need an army.

                                BLADE
                    That's it! An electronic army! If I were us,
                    I'd get on the internet, send out a major
                    distress signal.

                                RAZOR
                    Hackers of the World, Unite!

                                BLADE
                    How are you going to take care of the cops?

        Dade just smiles.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        Dade hacks into the city traffic light control system.
        Suddenly there is gridlock on the streets of New York
        City.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK.

        Nikon is playing chess against two Hassidic Jews.
        Cereal's beeper goes off. It displays the message:

                       GRAND CENTRAL
                       HACK THE PLANET

                                CEREAL
                    Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand
                    Central. Let's hit it!

        Nikon checkmates his opponent and the two leave.

        Dade, Cereal, Nikon, and Kate skate through the streets.
        Dade's program to freeze all the traffic lights on green,
        runs on schedule at 9:00:00 precisely. Picture New York City in
        morning rush hour, and every traffic light is green. Instant
        gridlock ensues. The four skate through the traffic easily, while
        the Secret Service, now pursuing them, is stuck. Gill punches a
        parked car in frustration. Its alarm goes off.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

        The four hackers skate into Grand Central Station and head
        to the lowest level. They meet up with Joey.

                                CEREAL
                    Hey Joey, you made it!

INT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES.

        The hackers are now setting up laptops at a bank of pay
        phones.  Dade is wearing a "Pirate Eye" eyepiece.

                                KATE
                    Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us
                    time, we have to get into Plague's file and
                    copy the worm.

        Cereal screams.

                                CEREAL
                    Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was
                    a little tension breaker, that had to be done,
                    alright?

                                KATE
                    Cereal.

                                KATE
                    Go fix the phones.

                                CEREAL
                    Roger.

        Cereal takes off to fix the phones.

                                KATE
                    Joey, take his place.

                                JOEY
                    What, me?

                                KATE
                    Take his place, man, do it. You can do it.

        Joey takes Cereal's place.

                                KATE
                    Ready?

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                KATE
                    Alright, let's boot up.

        The four boot up their machines. Various vanity screens
        come up on the laptops. They begin to hack. We see the
        inside of the Gibson. Viruses of all kinds begin to pour
        in. In the offices and data processing rooms, the
        Ellingson staff are in pandemonium. Happy faces with eye
        patches appear on their screens. "Sit on my interface."
        "Shit for Brains." "Arf Arf Arf!" Cookie monsters.

        Almost supernaturally, Plague is already gone. He was
        right next to her, stark naked in bed a second ago.

INT. SECRET SERVICE OFFICES.

        The hackers embrace and congratulate each other again,
        Lauren Murphy hugs her son.

INT. POLICE STATION, WOMEN'S LOCKUP.

        Margo Wallace has been arrested, and is being led into the
        women's lockup. Some of the other women grab at her
        expensive Italian leather jacket as she is led to her cell.

                                MARGO
                    I don't even know how to work a VCR, let alone
                    a computer! Get off! Look, listen, I'll make
                    a deal. Eugene Belford! I know where his
                    mother is, I promise you. Get offa me! I need
                    a lawyer!

INT. AIRLINER CABIN.  IN FLIGHT.

                                STEWARDESS
                    Here you are, Mr. Babbage.  Flight time to
                    Tokyo should be about 14 hours today. Can I
                    get you anything else?

        "Babbage" is The Plague in disguise; he now appears about
        60 years old.

                                PLAGUE
                    Just a pillow please.

        The pillow slides in behind his head, he reaches up to
        adjust it.

                                PLAGUE
                    Thank you.

        A handcuff snaps onto his wrist. It's Gill.

                                GILL
                    You're welcome.

                                PLAGUE
                    What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess!
                    I'll never fly this airline again!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY SIDEWALK. NIGHT.

        Dade and Kate are on their date. Dade is smartly,
        somewhat androgynously dressed. Kate is heavily made up,
        and yes, she is wearing a dress.

                                DADE
                    You look good in a dress.

                                KATE
                    You would have looked better.

                                DADE
                    Wanna go for a swim?

EXT. ROOFTOP SWIMMING POOL.

        Dade and Kate swimming, fully clothed, in a pool on a
        roof.

                                KATE
                    I can't believe they decided you won.

                                DADE
                    They didn't. The guys felt it was the only
                    way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty
                    good. You're elite.

                                KATE
                    Yeah? You know if you would have said so in
                    the beginning, you would have saved yourself
                    a whole lot of trouble.

        They look out at the skyline. Suddenly, the lights in
        three buildings change. They spell out:

                    C         B
                     R    A    U
                      A    N    R
                       S    D    N
                        H

        Kate laughs, honestly impressed.

                                DADE
                    Beat that!

        Kate continues laughing.

                                DADE
                    You know, I've been having these really
                    weird..

                                KATE
                                (finishing his sentence)
                    Dreams?

        They kiss passionately.

          BLACK. It's everywhere. It swallows the screen. And so we stare
          into a sea of BLACK.

          NARRATOR (V.0.)
          I saw a severed head once. Except for the,
          paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed.
          The end came abruptly you could tell
          'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence.
          "Shh.  ," the curled lips attempted. Like
          it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley"
          or... "shit happens." Your eyes don't
          forget things like that. Like you don't
          forget the sound animals make when
          they're humping. Primal.
          Raw. They endure
          in you forever because the senses have a
          brain all their own and they recall long
          after you've succumbed to the la-la of
          forgetfulness.
          (a pregnant beat)
          Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.

          (BEAT)
          And it starts all over again.
          From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           We are in the eye of a STORM, an angry mass of clo uds raging
          o f a howling WIND. across the black sky..It brings RAIN and THUNDER an d the swirl
          An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness.
          weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the
          A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE
          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.
          It's a man.
          It's a man, plus.
          It's a SUPERHERO,
          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b
          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.
          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
          Disheveled. Worn. A face
          chiselled with mileage.
          

          

          2.
          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the
          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.
          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
          down the street like loose change.
          The rain continues its onslaught.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not
          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,
          dinner before them.
          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a
          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as
          low fat milk.
          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A
          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
          attitude.
          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK
          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn
          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.

          MARY
          The principal did'nothing. Like
          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
          being tardy. What's the matter with
          education? Back when, you could go to
          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...
          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the
          way home.

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
          gait.
          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
          raped subway wall.
          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...

          "YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
          Deposits it under his coat.
          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
          above.
          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open
          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes
          out of his clothes.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before
          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-
          the-face body.


          5.
           Horns strikes
           a He-man pose, his
           biceps in the
           wind.

           He removes the Police apparel,
           plastic. Proceeds to put it on.

   
          INT. RED


          EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

          FISH
          How the fuck can I help you sir?


           SUPERHERO
          A room.
     

          

          6.
          His blood-shot eyes mean it.
          Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail.

          FISH
          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.
          (re: the check-in sheet)
          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.
          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles

          HANCOCK
          on the dotted line.
          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's
          grab.

          FISH (CONT'D)
          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,
          and I don't know you from Jack. You want
          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.
          Plunger's extra.

          HANCOCK
          I need quiet. Is it quiet?

          FISH
          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public
          library to you? The girls work. Some of
          them scream, some of them moan...

          (SMILES)
          and some of them just kinda lay there
          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls
          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.

          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
          under the window.

          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.

          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
          CLINKS off the counter.
          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus, in full uniform - dark blue pants, shirt.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt -
          complete with holster.

          Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured
          by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal.
          He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we
          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.
          A shoulder patch reads...

          U-RENT SECURITY CO.
          Their motto: "TO OBSERVE AND RECORD"
          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.

          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story
          is rain.
          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty
          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.
          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's
          interpretation of a man's weapon.
          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.

          HORUS
          How's the eye?

          AARON
          Black.
          Horus enters.
          Stands awkwardly before his son.

          HORUS
          It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it
          up with some make-up and you won't even
          know it's there.

          AARON
          Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly
          make-up on my face.
          Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.

          

          

          

          

          B.

          HORUS
          (almost apologetically)
          There'll always be people around
          who'll... exert force over those of us
          who just want to live in peace.
          Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (pain in every word)
          The thing to do is... to avoid them.
          They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the
          anger... and move on. You hold the anger.
          (turns to Aaron)
          I tell you because I can't take it,
          seeing you hurt. You're part of me.

          (BEAT)
          I've felt what you're feeling now. And if
          you've got any of me in you, you're gonna
          feel what I felt-when you go up against
          one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you
          do... the other cheek. You do that for
          me. No, you're not the coward. Not you.
          No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause
          I don't want to see you hurt. I love you.
          I ask you to do that for me... your old
          man.
          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark
          hallway - moved b y his affection.
          She oversees a father-son embrace.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          I'm late for work. Get some sleep.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          .after a good night sleep.
          The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the
          room.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him
          from behind.
          It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.

          HORUS
          Mary.

          

          

          

          

          9.
           Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore. She nestles
          up against her husband.
           Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back.
          He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator.
           Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured

          BY
          the moment.
          And out of nowhere...

          HORUS (CONT'D)

          (AWKWARD)
          I'm late.
          Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like she almost
          expected it.

          MARY

          (DISAPPOINTED)
          Right.

          (BEAT)
          Coffee's by the door.
           She marches back into the kitchen. Horus stares at his feet.
          S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face.
           He settles for the door, grabs hisjac ke , coffee thermos. A
           look at Mary and he's out thedoo rt

          CUT TO:

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Mary - against
          the kitchen sink.
          Her thin cotton
          dress clings to a body still'robust with enrgy,
          to breasts so ful l they could yread Uncl
           pop a boner inoud e
           And while the storm rages outside, Mary burns in a feverish
          sweat. The swelling steam and running ho t water combine to
          saturate her chest and face - she drips.
           Mary gazes out at the wet abyss, possessed by some inner
          longing.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM (7F) - NIGHT

          A T.V. SET. It MOANS from the corner of a room. Scant
          blinking red neon from the street cannot disguise thecant lighting

          On a shredded s, blotched with urine and cum, we SEE a
          trenehc -lï¿½n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the
          picture.
          An open door faces the MOANING TV set. It's the bathroom and
          it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock.
          He squats on the TOILET, pants around the ankles, cape shrouded
          around him.
          Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen, a cigarette
          dangling from the corner of his lip.
          We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
          a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy.

          Ooh yeah, big fella. That's it. Shoot
          your load, baby. Let it fly... FLY...!
          (male; in ecstasy)
          fly. YES! G0000D!
          Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a glint of pain on his
          face.
          He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick
          deteriorates into ashes before our eyes.
          And outside, it rains like there's no tomorrow.

          EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - DAY

          Morning brings a cease-fire on precipitation. The streets

          INT. RED EYE MOTEL (7F) - DAY

          An ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts.
          A bed unslept. The TV is on, commercialing some spring-fresh
          vaginal wash. The room sits empty.
          But the bathroom door is open. Inside, the supersuit peeled down
          to his waist, Hancock shaves.

          HANCOCK
          (mumbling; rehearsing)
          it's about responsibility... with
          what is empowered in you... to correct
          the ills of man.
          No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE
          - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to
          sleep.

          Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a

          On the tube, the commercial segues way into...

          eradicates images of war and chaos.
          He returns to the bathroom. To the mirror. Proceeds to spray his
          teeth with 409...

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - DAY

          Behold this imposing, block-long behemoth of commerce and
          decadence. A shopper's wet dream, this is WATANABE'S SHOPPING

          EMPORIUM.
          From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins
          come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples.
          As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and
          Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk.
          Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a
          swig from its hollow interior.

          ROHEIM
          I'll just play out the rest of this Eight
          Ball...
          He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries

          14.
          A POLICE VEHICLE enters this urban landscape. It slows in front
          of them. The cops: RUTGER and ADAMS, two hairy-knuckled
          testosterone cases with nothing to do.

          RUTGER.
          (passenger seat)
          Boys...
          The cops smile at one another. A large SHOTGUN rests fully erect
          between them. And they drive off.
          Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the

          "TO SERVE AND PROTECT"
          of their vehicle.
          Roheim watches him - turning red with drama.

          ROHEIM
          Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of
          warm spit... couldn't find their
          asshole with common sense and a thumb.

          (BEAT)
          Like I been saying, it's their.loss. The
          jerk-offs, they don't got the heart...
          the sensitivity of a man like you.
          Horus tries to shrug off these words. No good - they stick like
          a thorn in the eye of his soul.

          ROHEIM (CONT'.D)

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          On the rooftop; the Red Eye Motel.
          A trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back, only. We
          recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape,
          peering out from a hole in his coat.
          A cloud of smoke lingers above his head, from an unseen
          cigarette. He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood, ever so
          still.
          Something brews within this superman.

          The streets of Sheepshead: apartments, brownstones speckled with

          are the "esque" in Bro ly qu
          Through this hustle-bustle, we spot Mary and Aaron on their way

          TO

          BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
          Schoolyard activities abound. Buses, bouncing balls, and hoards
          of screaming little anti-christs.

          Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the latter trying
          to pull ahead and away.

          AARON
          I know it. I know it.

          MARY
          I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining
          weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.

          MARY
          Is my dress too tight?

          AARON
          What? Nothing. It's fine.

          MARY
          Really, my waist isn't too big?

          AARON
          What? Not here, mom.

          AARON

          Geez!
          He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.

          Two-thirty.

          AARON
          All right, mom.
          He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.

          MARY
          (after him; in vain)
          You want anything from the store?
          He's gone.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          This is the Longfellow's street - lower-middle class but
          comfortable, quaint, safe. Mr. Longfellow, hustling through the
          street, takes us home.
          Greeting him at the entrance, at the mailboxes, is CLYDE BANNER
          (35). Quite large this tenant is, quite simply a Cro-Magnon Man.
          Clyde stands with the morning paper in hand, searching
          carelessly through. He finds the SPORTS PAGE. Hides it under his
          robe.

          Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.

          CLYDE
          Picked this up for you.
          (pulls the paper back)
          Say thanks.

          He heads inside.
          Horus swallowing it. He unshuffles the paper, finding the front
          page. The headline reads...

          RAINSTORM HITS SHEEPSHEAD. NO END IN SIGHT.
          Horus checks the sky - a sinewy mesh of angry clouds. He lumbers
          inside.

          bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful.
          She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK.
          A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop.
          Mary continues forth, entering the bank.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Sheepshead DENIZENS crisscross amok. People queue behind teller
          lines, taking care of business.
          Mary takes her place. She glances at the bank CLOCK - it's 10

          A BEE spirals the air and lands on the sleeve of a nervous ARM.
          This arm protrudes from the dark Chevy, parked before the bank.
          The engine is running.
          The arm fidgets. SHOOS the insect away. With white knuckles, it
          grips the wheel.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Same bank, same people. Mary awaits service in the same line.
          A MAN ambles pass Mary's line, up towards the front. He cuts off
          the person in front, an elderly WOMAN.

          WOMAN
          Hey, what's the idea?
          The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal.
          grin. This man is TOM (35), as plainly evil as the eye can see.

          Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the
          situation at hand. They begin to panic.
          On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY (30's), emerge from the
          crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES.
          Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun.
          As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each
          end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin.
          The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues.
          The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with
          ,Irâº that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.

          Lips, legs, lungs - stuff prepubescent wet dreams are made of.
          Aaron, nestled mid-room, tries to keep his eyes straight.
          He steals a quick look to the back of the room: there, in the
          back, a BLONDE boy (8) sits chewing gum.
          This kid, from the slicked-back hair and rolled-up t-shirt
          sleeves, is a sub-species of vermin.

          JERRY #2
          (at her ring)
          Give me that.

          

          

          

          

          22.
          Jerry #2, testicles in his throat.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom is out on the floor, gun wielding. Jerry #1 is with him,
          loot bags in hand.

          TOM
          (to the crowd)
          No heroes! No heroes!
          Jerry #2 returns, bad news on his tongue.

          JERRY #2
          He flew! Fucking Fred flew!

          TOM
          Fuck! Fuck!
          A wave of SIRENS punctuate their state of "fuck." It crescendoes
          around the building.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          SQUADS of police cars form a noose around the building. A
          S.W.A.T. teem spews from a transport unit, armed for the big
          tightening. Guns and ammo abound.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Jerry #1 is at the entrance - peering out at doom.

          JERRY #1

          (IMPRESSED)
          Wow, S.W.A.T.

          TOM
          (muttering; spelling the end)
          I'm not going back.
          Mary, amongst the crowd, takes a glance at the CLOCK --one
          thirty.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BANK DAY

          Time LAPSES. It's 2:30.
          Mary turns from the clock, concerned. She studies the situation,
          the robbers - an overall glumness tells the story. At the
          entrance - Tom. He looks desperate. Irrational. Ready to snap.

          

          

          

          

          23.
          The hostages huddle on the floor, tired. They wait.

          EXT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY - DAY

          The CLOCK on the building reads 2:30 school is out. Children
          file out of classrooms. Scatter. Only Aaron remains, alone to
          the elements - waiting.
          A ball bounces, rolls to his feet. Aaron looks...
          It's not a ball. It's a doll's head.
          Aaron's face - dread.

          My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo...
          A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity.
          Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard,
          tumbles out and onto the sidewalk.
          Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered -
          he's probably dead.

          The cops, Ted., Chad. Rutger and Adams - they all REACT, guns
          raised.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom huddles by the entrance, gun smoking. Cool and suave has
          succumbed to psychotic. The Jerrys are nearby, nervous. As are
          the hostages, clumped together in fright.

          TOM

          (SNAPPED)
          I'm not gonna say it again, Ted!
          (re: hostages)
          swiss cheese. All of them!

          TED (O.S.)
          Time's running out, fellas!
          The hostages grimace, hell not so far away.

          TOM
          I want that car, Ted!

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          Ted punches Chad on the shoulders.

          TED
          Where's that car, Jesus!

          CHAD
          It's out getting your pizza.

          TOM (O.S.)
          . a car and I want it NOW!
          And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a
          CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance.
          It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway
          Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps
          still reeling from the impact.
          The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED,
          the getaway driver (alias, the arm.) Fred lands on the hood of
          the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame.
          SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up.

          TED
          (at the sky)
          What the...

          

          

          

          

          25.
          There :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight. He
          examines the ground below. And he dives.
          Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the
          bank structure, flying around and around.
          Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots.
          Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside
          subsides. Stops.
          A loaded beat.
          Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of
          bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the
          scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages.
          in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With
          a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route
          to the windshield of a police vehicle outside.
          Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of
          steel.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          Jerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into
          another awaiting police windshield.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Smoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes
          fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble.
          Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his
          frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect.
          Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out
          the WOMEN - Veronica's wet smile takes him.
          A heartbeat.

          HANCOCK

          (GOD)
          Everybody out, please.
          Bodies bang about, all moving for the door.

          

          

          

          

          26.
          Mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped
          figure, until real estate ushers her into the street.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          PARAMEDICS converge on the hostages .
          The cops are at a loss - deers staring down a pair headlights.
          They train their guns on the bank, waiting for answers.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars
          us to the back, where the bank SAFE is.
          We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a
          thick steel chamber of commerce. Hancock arrives at the safe.
          Confronts the object inside - Tom.

          INT. BANK SAFE - DAY

          There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears
          his revolver, aimed at Hancock. Hancock enters the safe.

          TOM
          Stay away.
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I'm not going back.
          Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams it shut with a
          resounding THUD. They're locked in.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (HYSTERICAL)
          What're you doing?
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          What's going on, here?
          Hancock no response. Tom raises his gun, and meaning it.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          Answer me! Say something!

          (FIRES)
          Fuck me!

          

          

          

          

          27.
          BANG! Tom fires a. shot off Hancock's forehead. The BULLET
          ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity.
          It rips Tom's right EAR from his head.

          HANCOCK
          (catching the renegade slug)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back,
          clutching his head. He bleeds.

          TOM
          Fuck... My shirt.

          HANCOCK
          (steps forward)
          Why don't we call it the day.

          TOM
          (gun raised)
          Don't. I told you... I'm not going back.

          HANCOCK

          (IRRITATED)
          If you're going to tease, cock the damn
          gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded
          animal act of desperation. I don't got c,
          time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't
          expect... dialogue and "come with me and
          you won't be hurt" bullshit. You walk out
          of here with me and your life is a
          violent storm. You will be hurt, you will
          be abused... whatever turns them on.
          Either way, your days are shit! Those are
          the realities, spelled out.

          TOM
          What's eating you, man?

          HANCOCK

          (UPSET)
          You got half the precinct out there,
          armed, trained to blow the tail off a
          sperm from a hundred yards... you're
          standing in here, cornered, three bullets
          left in that squirter of yours, if you're
          lucky, and you got one ear. I don't need
          the aggravation. I don't need this.

          TOM
          Man, you're jaded. I'm not asking for a
          rainbow...

          TOM (CONT' D)
          you don't got to shower me with respect.
          Just a little.. tenderness, is all. Have
          you no mercy, mister?

          HANCOCK
          (he's had enough)
          I'm all out. Let's go...
          And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.

          TOM

          (HURT)
          Fuck you.
          Close on his trigger finger. It tightens...

          HANCOCK

          NO!

          INT. BANK - DAY

          On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear
          THREE SHOTS - from the safe.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          The schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to
          where we are.
          Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and
          fire-escapes and ominous gray skies. DARK FIGURES move into this
          sight - they eclipse the heavens.
          And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
           - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER
          and ERLICK (both his age.)
          Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts
          his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him -
          the blonde kid from class.
          We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,
          SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          The aftermath.
          Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing
          through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this
          superman.

          

          

          

          

          29.
          We follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious
          Veronica again, it spots WOMEN, all who'd die for a chance to
          suck on his cape.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Mary hastens after Aaron, urine-soaked and on the verge of
          tears. He rages down the street while his mother pursues.

          MARY
          Tell me... what happened?

          AARON
          (about to break)
          You were late.

          MARY
          I was held up...

          AARON
          The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.

          MARY
          .at the bank. Honey, were they the same
          ones? Don't cry.

          AARON
          Get a grip, mom.
          They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the
          stairs.

          EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying.
          Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by
          Horus, sleep still on his face.

          HORUS
          How was your day?
          Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Just your average professional building, several stories of
          brick and cement.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          But all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the
          top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised
          before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind.
          From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get
          him down.

          JUMPER'

          (SELF-PITY)
          People ignore me.
          From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his
          honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window
          across the street.

          FIREMAN
          Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          (through her teeth)
          You're not unattractive.

          FIREMAN
          Baldness is not fatal.

          JUMPER
          My wife ignores me.

          FIREMAN
          Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls
          acknowledge you, we all do.

          JUMPER
          No.

          SECRETARY
          Yes.

          JUMPER
          Really?
          The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING
          across the street. The secretary points...

          EXT. OPPOSITE BUILDING - DAY

          There...

          

          

          

          

          31.
          on the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen
          earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom.
          His mother's FREAKING from the window.
          Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and
          gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his
          lonesome.
          The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole,
          dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric.
          Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice.
          On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
          the infant down.
          But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and
          silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete.
          He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of
          mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior.
          We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose-
          diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          An apartment building engulfed in FLAMES. FIRE TRUCKS don't even

          bemoan the loss of...
          Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble
          and surfaces clean on the other side of the building.
          Blanketed under his cape are two little TODDLERS, and a young
          WOMAN in bra and panties. He lowers them to safety.

          We're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening
          into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in
          her apron, Mary watches the news...

          Horus turns his focus to the TV - more Hancock FOOTAGE. He
          watches Mary.

          HORUS
          Mary?

          

          

          

          

          33.

          MARY
          Yes.

          .HORUS
          I... had no idea.

          MARY
          (on the TV)
          What could you do?
          Horns - hat in hand, goes to the door. He wants to stay.

          HORUS
          (opens door)
          Good thing he was there. I don't know
          what I'd do... if you...
          Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She
          turns to face an empty room.

          MARY
          Coffee's by the... door.

          (GUILTY)
          Horus?

          INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

          A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light
          outside. A rhythmic POUNDING reverberates through this darkness.
          More intense it becomes.
          And then a high-pitch GASP. Two individuals, man and woman,
          stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window.
          They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving
          pistons.
          For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's
          Veronica.

          VERONICA
          (a her voice trembles)
          Oh god.
          The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with
          sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm.
          Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
          breasts beckoning at ceiling.
          Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the
          window. She paws after him.

          

          

          

          

          34.

          VERONICA (CONT'D)
          What'd I do?

          HANCOCK

          (DEJECTED)
          'Nothing. I'm sorry.
          And with that, he floats out into the night.

          VERONICA
          (dazed; after him)
          Hancock.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his
          head.
          He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of
          malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his
          uniform, his gun.
          They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security.
          The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO (25), as tough as a steel-
          belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.

          SCARPO
          Nutri-cop.
          Horus keeps walking.

          SCARPO (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Look like the Man. Walk like the Man.
          Shit, ain't half the Man.

          OTHERS
          Ain't half the Man.
          Horus simply walks away.

           CUT TO:

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          A streetlight HUMS. Blinks - revealing a deserted alley in'
          sporadic intervals. Garbage, etc.
          A slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight. Pelts a soulful
          Hancock below - he moves through the gray dreariness in
          solitude.

          

          

          

          

          35.
          He reaches behind his e. withdraws a box of cigarettes.
          Taps himself a stick.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          How about spreading some of that joy?
          Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own
          slimy kind of way.
          In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a
          gun to Hancock's temple.

          HOODLUM

          (PSYCHOTIC)
          Better yet, why don't I just take it...
          Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by
          the throat via one arm, the gun with the other.

          HANCOCK

          (SUPER-PSYCHOTIC)
          What are you thinking?
          The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground -
          one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt.
          The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the
          pavement.

          HOODLUM
          (fuck me)
          Shit...

          HANCOCK
          What are you thinking?!
          Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own
          mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D )
          Huh?!
          Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the-
          Hoodlum's nose.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          Want to see brain? Huh?!
          Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside.
          Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth.
          The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          HOODLUM
          (with his mouth full)
          Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a
          wife. I got student loans...
          Hancock - intense.
          Is this getting through?

          HOODLUM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          please. Have a heart, mister.
          Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state.
          He lowers the. Hoodlum.
          He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the
          Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          In the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in
          preparation for departure.
          A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with
          frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp
          amongst themselves.
          Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV -
          it's like he can't escape the good news.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The TV set.
          More news on the day's activities. Mary sits mesmerized on the
          sofa, holding a dish she had planned to dry.
          Aaron surfaces from the hallway, lured out by the TV He comes up
          behind Mary - his black eyes on the news.

          MARY

          (SURPRISED)
          You're still up.

          AARON
          Can't sleep.
          He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother.
          They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing
          Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this
          man.

          That's him?

          MARY
          There's something about him... I don't
          know.
          A female REPORTER concludes the footage...

          REPORTER

          (FAINTLY)
          And so we ask... who is this man?
          Speculation abounds - government super-
          experiment, an aberration of nature, or
          extraterrestrial renegade? Who are you?
          Where are you now, superguy? Call me.

          (SMILES)
          We'll get together. Have a drink.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          HADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town.
          NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home
          to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god.
          We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
          hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
          water in Dixie cups.
          It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his
          face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen.

          HANCOCK

          (MUTTERING)
          What he's got to do... a man's got to do
          it.

          EXT. BAR - NIGHT

          Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
          above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
          We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
          peers into the alley.
          There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
          JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
          legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
          The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...

          

          

          

          

          38.
          A COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further
          violence.
          Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
          legs.
          A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
          other's eyes for answers.
          The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
          it into the light.

          WHORE
          (the sage)
          You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're
          tired...

          (BEAT)
          and in need.
          Hancock - his eyes agree.
          The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes
          out a MATCHBOOK.
          Hands it to him.

          WHORE (CONY' D)
          My business card.
          (to the phone booth)
          My office.
          Hancock inspects the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside.

          HANCOCK

          (GEENA)
          Gina.

          WHORE

          Aaron's room, his nightlight the only source of light. Mary sits

          AARON
          Don't.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the
          side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing
          into the trash cans below.
          Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
          against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
          He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
          the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-
          up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic.
          He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than
          we think it deserves.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary swallows. Starts in on the tune.

          MARY
          "Once there was a way, to get back
          homeward. Once there was a way, to get

          Shut up.

          There, on his ass, his head a raging inferno - Hancock listens,
          as if he can hear.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Aaron, succumbing to his mother's song - his lids flutter.

          MARY
          "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Something overcomes this fevered superman. He begins to unravel.
          A calm consumes him. Tames him. It could be Mary's voice - maybe
          he can hear it, and then maybe not.

          MARY (V.O.)
          "Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles
          awake you when you rise."
          Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.

          (CONTINUING)
          "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I

          Erratic traces of an urban landscape JAG about.
          Aaron's distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in
          flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors.
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They chase him from behind, HOOTING,
          taunting poor Aaron - they're out for blood.
          Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping...

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          .. but a brick wall stares him down, providing no exit. He
          swallows hard.
          FOOTSTEPS approach, just seconds away. Close on Aaron, as blood
          drains from his face. His eyes dash for a garbage CAN - but is
          there time?
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They can smell their prey.

          They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just
          the brick wall and a trash can.
          They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
          scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash
          can.
          He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They
          ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing.
          That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
          hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
          In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them
          away.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her

          A secluded view of the city, high above. Hancock, Aaron under
          his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands.
          Aaron scampers away. Turns and faces the man.
          Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes. He shakes his
          head. Disappointed.
          He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.

          HANCOCK
          You smoke?

          AARON
          What?

          HANCOCK
          Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid.
          (beat; takes a puff)
          Smoke no evil.
          Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.

          (re: cigarette)

          Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't
          kill you. Once.
          Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on
          it. Doubles over, coughing.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your
          first stick. Then, after a few more... it
          starts getting this. flavor. A little
          nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of
          a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only
          now, it takes a whole pack to get
          there.., and you won't settle till your,
          mouth's as sweet.
          Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing
          philosophical.

          change. Can start by changing some

          AARON
          Principles?

          HANCOCK
          Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just
          about all you need to know: a man's got
          to do what a man's got to do.
          (beat; smokes)
          I look at your face, the shiners. You
          took a shove and you let it go clean. Not
          good. That's a formula for future
          abuse... an invitation to the loser's
          dance. Letting it go. Walking away.
          ,(shakes head)
          Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're
          running, looking for a place to hide.

          AARON
          What am I suppose to do?

          HANCOCK
          You do what is necessary.

          AARON
          I wanted... there were three of them.

          HANCOCK
          What is necessary.

          Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
          relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A
          fox and he's walking through what, the
          woods, the forests, right? Next thing the
          fox knows, he's staring down a pack of...
          hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this
          chase, the fox's running his ass off,
          over boulders and through streams and,
          but the damn hounds are still on his
          tail. Finally the fox comes to this
          cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
          seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
          rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
          are closing in and they're going to tear
          him to pieces. So what does he think...
          "I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
          confront them and I'll get my ass
          butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
          "stay and least I'd have something, a
          chance.

          go down fighting, make a stand. Right?

          happens?

          Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.

          HANCOCK
          No. The fox gets his ass kicked and
          some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs,
          like cheap fabric.

          AARON
          What're you saying?

          HANCOCK
          But you know, when the last hound was
          through with him,-and he's walking away,
          he hears this noise. It's the fox and
          he's muttering something under his
          breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets
          up close. To hear what he's saying. You
          know what the fox's saying... just before
          he keels off?
          Aaron - negative.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Now he's gurgling, choking on his own 
          blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying
          next to his entrails, you know... and you
          know what he says?
          (raises his fist in the air)
          "No regrets."

          AARON
          What?

          HANCOCK
          No regrets. You make a decision and you
          stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And
          "no regrets."
          Aaron - submitting it to memory.

          AARON

          Hancock explains this defiance of gravity. He gently lowers
          Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother.
          She beckons him. Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms.
          She stares up at Hancock - her eyes, stricken with fear. Or

          Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He
          continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping
          for dinner.
          She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there

          He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm
          extended. All eyes on Horus - befuddled.

          jewelry. On three floors.

          It's a night job. I sit around.

          You're a security guard. You keep the

          urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism

          South Pacific. Bodies floating in the
          water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some
          routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns
          out, the only one alive was the captain,
          up against a buoy... crying 'cause he

          (to Hancock)
          He comes home crying.

          AARON
          Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.

          HANCOCK

          (REACTS)
          No... there's no shame in it. The crying.
          It's relief...
          (to Mary)
          we're older and we don't remember
          when... we go, "God, when was the last
          time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an
          effort, now. Takes more pain... more
          blood. Like it's, do you have the time
          anymore? Even to look back and recall a
          moving experience. To be moved.

          (AARON)
          By rage. Hurt.

          (MARY)
          By love.

          But if you have to remember the last time
          something touched you... you've missed it
          - you've forgotten how to cry.
          Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this
          magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose
          nature he has yet to comprehend.
          Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door.
          Hancock - holds him accountable.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (AWARE)
          Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too.

          HORUS
          Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't
          want to interfere. I have work.

          MARY
          (the original sin)
          Oh, I forgot to make coffee.
          She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.

          MARY
          No, I'll make it right now.

          HORUS
          I don't have time. I'll grab some on the
          way. Thanks.
          Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I don't want to interrupt. Please don't
          let me stop you.

          HANCOCK
          No, I need to go.
          (at' Mary and only Mary)
          The last time I had a meal... an evening
          like this, I was... it was too long ago.
          I appreciate your kindness.

          MARY

          (AWKWARD)
          Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime.
          Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under
          Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away.

          HANCOCK
          Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll
          drop by after school. See how you're
          doing.

          AARON

          (SMILES)
          Yeah.
          Horus watches this - his son slipping away.
          The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first.
          Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and
          EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging
          wild.
          We just .don't know.

          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The two men appear from the entrance, shoulder to shoulder -
          sort of. They enter the street.

          HORUS

          (POINTING)
          I'm this way.
          Hancock points the opposite way.

          HANCOCK
          Need a lift?

          HORUS
          It's a short walk.
          Acknowledged.
          An awkward beat while they stare at each other...
          . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk
          and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight.
          From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge
          into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.

          INT. AARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary's folding clothes by the dresser, busy with thought. Aaron
          squats on the bed, his brain going a mile a minute. He plops
          back against the bed. Brings his hand up to his face. Makes a
          fist. Thinking. Wondering.

          MARY
          What're you doing?
          She's taken by this scene.

          AARON
          (releases fist)
          Thinking.
          Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.

          AARON
          No. Not really. Are you?

          AARON
          Me neither. I was thinking.., about
          tomorrow.

          MARY
          Go to sleep. You know what dad says.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          I know, mom... after a good night sleep.
          He says that but he's the one working
          every night. Does that mean he never
          feels better? He's always feeling
          terrible?

          MARY

          (AMUSED)
          Go to bed, anyway.
          She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the
          door...

          will be.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          Looking down aisles of merchandise - not a trace of life and not
          unlike a cemetery.
          All is dead, with the exception of FOOTSTEPS - shoes pacing
          linoleum. It's Horus, on duty. His flashlight leads the way...

          Outside, the SIRENS of police vehicles charge by - real men en

          Horus watches them from the window - like a kid who can't come
          out to play.
          He turns to look across the floor - Roheim, against a chair,
          watching the NEWS on a big-screen TV

          It's dark out here in the night. On the roof. Overlooking the
          community, the Longfellow's apartment building... and Mary's
          bedroom.
          From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She
          disrobes down to bare back...
          And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS
          into view. Hancock watches from here, the cigarette BLAZES back
          towards his face intense.

          A foreign TERRAIN of trees, of lakes so clear and blue.
          They pass below us as we soar through air and mist...
          the mist clears, thrusting us into the dense foliage of a
          JUNGLE. We penetrate the silence
          the silence, it fades into SONG - the silk, mellifluous
          voice of a woman (not unlike Mary's). Her siren call beckons
          us... takes us deeper into unknown greenery...
          but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to
          song. SCREAMS and CRIES rise from the smoke, women and children
          in hysterics...

          Rocket and mortar shells EXPLODE in our path, splitting trees
          and earth...
          . we remain undaunted... but the WAILS of suffering
          continues...
          until we get there, there in a clearing as smoke and debris
          settle... and we see the remains of a lake, a,lake full of
          BLOOD... of mangled BODIES floating like flotsam... WOMEN and

          CHILDREN... DEAD...

          INT. RED EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

          Hancock bolts from his bed - horrified, eyes cracked with red
          veins. He is soaked.
          The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the
          adjacent motel room -.the wall behind Hancock's bed trembles to
          the rhythm of each pelvic thrust...

          Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch, then the

          thinking posture.
          Horns seems lost in his own blank stare.

          A deserted street at this early hour. On the curb and by
          themselves - Horus and Roheim, ruminating.

          . that look on her face, you know the
          look, when she's almost there... makes

          and it's not even me, my body. Some guy,

          ears, you know?

          Mary stands alone on the sidewalk, looking up at heaven. Her
          eyes search the gray sky for signs of life.-
          There, overhead - a DOT. It grows in size, getting closer and
          arriving fast... and gradually, it shapes into Hancock.

          He swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes
          and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side.
          He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped
          together tightly.

          MARY
          (like a little girl)
          Let's see.

          HANCOCK
          You have to be quick.

          MARY
          Come on, I want to see.

          HANCOCK
          If you blink, you'll miss it.
          Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white
          something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into
          moisture. It showers into his open hands.
          Mary reaches for it. Too late.

          MARY
          I saw it, right? A little cloud.
          She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains.
          And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain.
          Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand
          touches his.
          He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
          her hand away.

          MARY (CONY' D)
          The water is dirty.

          HANCOCK

          (into his eyes)
          It's not your fault.

          Hancock looks away.

          HANCOCK

          MARY
          You should slow down. Rest.

          HANCOCK
          -So people tell me.

          MARY
          (heat; upon some thought)
          It must be hard.

          HANCOCK
          Hard?

          MARY
          To always do right... do good when all
          you want to do is rest.

          HANCOCK
          It's harder to not do anything. What am
          I? It's not for me. It's for... it is
          about people. Rest? When there is
          despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am
          relief. You know that instant, that split
          instant of time when you realize that the
          nightmare... the totality of fear
          itself... that it's all been a bad dream?
          That it's safe? That is relief. The
          infant in my arms... to the hysterical
          mother. When you can see her face, what's
          rest? It is self-indulgence.
          Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."

          MARY
          Where... who are you?

          HANCOCK
          It's not important who I am, Mary. Or
          what... where I'm from. It doesn't
          matter. I'm a man. I am every man.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          MARY
          (sizing up his words)
          You probably get a lot of practice
          explaining yourself, on account of who
          you are and what you do.

          HANCOCK
          Why... do you say that?

          MARY
          It's like, everything you say sounds...
          so perfect. Like you rehearse them so
          they'll be that way. I mean, not to say
          that it's insincere...

          (BEAT)
          I mean, maybe it's something about you
          but... it must be hard on you sometimes.
          Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (APOLOGETIC)
          But probably not... probably..

          HANCOCK
          Yes...
          (pulling teeth)
          sometimes.
          Mary allows the moment to sink in.

          MARY
          So, you never answered. Back there...
          what were you doing in the middle of the
          street?

          HANCOCK

          (THINKS)
          I was lost...

          (EXHALES)
          . but I think I'm ok, now.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Trash cans fly. Paper, swept up and sent aflutter. We've seen
          this before - Aaron, running for his life and the bullies in
          pell-mell pursuit.
          He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER
          to his liking.

          

          

          

          

          68.
          Erlick. Spengler. They zoom by and with great eagerness.
          Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat.
          From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks
          relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he
          takes.

          AARON

          (HANCOCK)
          " before long, you're running, looking
          for a place to hide."

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
          metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
          they scale it.
          Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
          side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.

          PERCEVAL
          Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed
          my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
          eyes are of disbelief.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          What's up?
          (checks his hair)
          What?
          Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
          with clenched fists.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          (rolls up sleeves)
          I just combed my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Don't bother. He's mine.
          (to Aaron)
          No biting. I hate biting.

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.

          ERLICK

          (OVERLAPPING)
          Do him, Percy. He's your woman.

          PERCEVAL
          Let's go. Let's have it. While we're
          still kids.
          Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent
          little gonad.

          (BEAT)
          Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny,
          purple-headed shlongs the size of...
          All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose.
          And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing
          BLOWS to the face and body.
          Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,
          left and right...

          ERLICK
          He's yours.

          SPENGLER
          Save some for us.
          Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine.
          Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky.
          He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of
          recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon.
          He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
          into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
          fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag.
          Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
          ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.

          ERLICK
          What's he doing?

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.
          Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
          fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP,
          revenge presents itself.

          ERLICK
          That's cold.

          

          

          

          

          ?0.

          SPENGLER
          Kill him, Percy.
          Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral
          orifice. Contemplates his target.
          Aaron - to pee or not to pee...
          ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.

          AARON
          (to the boys)
          Don't mess with me.
          He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline
          taking him away.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sleeps. Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush. She moves
          to the closet. Changes out of her clothes.
          Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
          watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet.
          Mary stands before the closet mirror. Does a profile check. She
          reaches for her bra... and from the mirror, catches Horus
          staring,.

          MARY
          You're still up?
          She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.

          HORUS
          Just get in?
          Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic
          attire. She nods affirmatively.

          MARY
          Nick's market. Are you sick?

          HORUS
          I can't sleep.
          She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms
          her own with the left, as reference.
          Horus tilts his head away from her hand.

          No thank you.

          MARY
          Yes, he is.
          He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues
          dressing - oblivious.

          HORUS
          He'll take him home?

          MARY
          Yes.

          HORUS
          What do we know about this man? The
          papers... they don't have all the facts
          about him.

          MARY
          What facts? He's not a hero.

          HORUS
          Yes. A hero. I know that...

          Aaron likes him.

          No. I have to start on dinner. So how
          about that glass of milk?
          Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          All right. Try to get some sleep.
          With that, she's out the door.
          Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his
          wretched face.
          He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside
          - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean?
          Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the
          cover.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Aaron races down the. last leg of his street. On the steps of his
          apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home. Yes, a
          cigarette smolders from his lips..
          Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence.
          And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves. Aaron,
          triumphant, SMACKS it for five.

          up at me, it hurt that bad.
          And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair -

          AARON (CONTD.)

          Through the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work.
          A framed PHOTOGRAPH of a distinguished MAN (50's) sits on the
          shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern
          and proud.
          Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet

          On the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron,

          Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his
          wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't
          realize he's there.
          Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Horus?

          it's almost eight. Dad's late.

          MARY
          Horus?
          She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the
          bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into
          the stairway outside.
          There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way
          up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen and under the light, Mary. Hancock. Aaron. Mary
          is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last SNIP.

          AARON
          like this?
          (holds up hand)
          How do you make a fist?

          MARY
          (grabs his head)
          Aaron, hold it.
          Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes.
          So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and
          bones. It SNARLS at Aaron.
          Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't
          let go of them.
          Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in
          him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Hancock?
          The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.

          Your hair. Come on, have a seat.

          Mom's going butcher your hair.

          Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n

          AARON
          Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her,
          Hancock.
          Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."

          AARON (CONT' D)
          Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I
          got to do.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The Big Haircut. Mary and Hancock - up close. Mary runs her
          fingers through his hair, testing his length. She leans into
          him. SNIP, goes her scissor.
          Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in
          her presence. Baffled.
          From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her
          sweater.
          And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
          of their breaths.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Hancock.
          Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
          he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.

          There... my hero.
          He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.

          HANCOCK
          Nice. Thank you.
          Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...

          MARY
          I started out just trimming for Horus.
          Here and there. He had to look just right
          for the academy, says his father, a
          police captain there... in Philly. When
          we moved here, I pretty much took over as
          the resident barber. You know, to save
          some money.

          HANCOCK
          He was in the-police academy?
          A pause.

          MARY
          His father's idea. Not his. He went
          through it anyway, like he had something
          to prove... the validation of his
          manhood.

          (BEAT)
          It tpok everything out of him. He didn't
          talk for days after he was cut. He took
          it real hard. I mean, still, he's not...
          I mean,, he's still...
          (edits herself)
          .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I
          understand that I'm not intolerant of it,
          the working-through process. It's just
          that, sometimes...
          (at Hancock)
          sometimes, I need his strength. I
          miss. the strength.

          HANCOCK
          Is that what you want?

          MARY
          Want?

          HANCOCK
          What you need?

          MARY
          The hair... I need to...

          She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down.

          HANCOCK

          Yes?

          (BEAT)
          You ever been down the boardwalk, at
          night?

          MARY
          Why... what for?
          They're eye to eye. Close.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Mom?
          Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
          in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.

          MARY
          Yes.
          Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!

          AARON
          my mouth. It's starting to swell. I
          think he loosened a tooth.
          Mary - maternal duty calls.

          MARY
          All right. Go to your room. I'll get the
          ice pack.
          Aaron exits. Mary exits.
          Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for
          the front door.
          Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...

          MARY (CONT' D)
          You're leaving?

          HANCOCK
          It's getting late.

          

          

          

          

          78.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          HANCOCK
          I'm going to take a walk.

          MARY
          Really? On the boardwalk?

          HANCOCK
          Maybe.
          Pause.

           AARON (O.S.)
          Mom.'

           MARY
          I'm sorry.
          She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he
          stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.

          HANCOCK

          (FINALLY)
          Good night, Mary.

          MARY
          Good night.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock - 9:45 pm.
          The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side
          door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer.
          He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and
          peers out at the street - no Roheim.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there,
          marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis.
          She mingles with a BAR FLY.
          Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
          From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap.
          Whispers to him.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          MAN
          I wear dresses. How about you?

          HANCOCK
          (considers; nah)
          Get lost.
          The warning comes across quite well - the man exits.
          Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
          bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.

          GINA
          (to bar fly)
          Meet you outside. The El Camino, right?
          The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
          in her hands, studies him.

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Your eyes are calm. It's good.
          She withdraws her hands.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          GINA
          But you're still here.
          She rises. And as she makes for the exit...

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Nice haircut.
          Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the
          rest of his cigarette - pensive.

          CUT TO:

           INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock, it reads 1:05 am.
          Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine
          takes him outside - via an EXIT door.

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          A dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes.
          Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the
          street.:.

          

          

          

          

          80.
          . as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's
          been drinking, right?

          HORUS
          Dear God.
          Horus catches him.

          INT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT

          They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the
          light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face
          bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling.
          A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.

          HORUS
          Jesus.
          Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to
          nurse' the wounds.

          ROHEIM
          Figured I can get you by the front... but
          you weren't there.

          HORUS
          (dabbing the torn lip)
          Who... what happened?

          ROHEIM
          They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and
          his boys. They were waiting on me.
          Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.

          HORUS
          Why didn't you come through the back...
          standing out there in the dark?

          ROHEIM
          -Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped
          them'in the fight.
          (feels his lip)
          Shit...
          He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.

          HORUS
          What're you doing?

          

          

          

          

          81.

          ROHEIM
          (into the mirror)
          the old man
          Look at what they did.. gave
          a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for
          shit.

          HORUS

          (FRUSTRATION)
          Sit down
          Could you knock it off, please.
          so I can clean the cuts.
          He leads the old wretch back to the chair.

          ROHEIM
          I'm a waste of time...

          HORUS
          Stop.

          ROHEIM
          I'm too old for this.

          HORUS
          You're not old.

          ROHEIM
          What am I... I'm biologically challenged.
          Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.

          (BEAT)

          I
           Use to be, I blame the job. The job.
           think, bullshit job. Not right for a man.
           "To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for
           the hell is DIo nly
           dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn
           reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the
          carpet.
          Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.

          ROHEIM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But you know what, Horus. That's all
          wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't
          make the man. It's me. Not the uniform.
          It starts right here... 'cause I can't do
          anything right. Fuck up my ABC's.
          (a beat; at Horus)
          But you. Why do you put up with this
          crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for
          you at home.
          Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.

          

          

          

          

          82.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a
          Marlboro. Eyes red. Hair in wet dishevelment. He's a mess.

          HANCOCK
          got to do what you got to do.
          He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other
          hand. We sense a decision brewing...

          INT. THE LONGFELLOW BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A desk clock points to 2:30 am.
          Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns...
          A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in
          the room. Mary catches it. Rises above her blanket.
          What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non-
          gravity. He stares directly at her.

          HANCOCK
          I know you're up, Mary. I know you can
          hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk
          tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's
          important that I talk to y ou, then.

          (GRAVELY)
          Please, Mary.
          And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned.

          CUT TO:

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up
          the stairs.

          ROHEIM
          They're going to can me.

          HORUS
          No one's canning anyone. No one saw us...
          watch your step... leave.

          ROHEIM
          Should be an extra key over the door.

          

          

          

          

          83.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine. Something
          is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the
          machinery.
          Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes
          back to the stove - her eggs beckoning.

          AARON
          The toast's burnt.

          MARY
          What?
          Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.

          AARON
          We're late... you forgot the corn chips.
          Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all
          over the place.

          MARY
          Eat... and we'll go.
          (checks her watch)
          Where's your father?
          She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.

          AARON
          You forgot the corn...
          (the comb snags)
          . ouch!

          MARY
          I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll
          be home before we leave. I'm sorry.

          AARON
          You having your period, mom?
          She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room.
          Horus ushers Roheim in...

          ROHEIM
          Shoes.
          The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sets Roheim down on the bed. Tucks him under.

          HORUS
          You're going to be okay?

          ROHEIM
          I don't know. You might have solo act
          tomorrow night.

          HORUS
          Get some sleep.

          ROHEIM
          You're a good man, Horus.

          HORUS
          (washing over it)
          I have to get home, now. I'll call.
          Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.

          ROHEIM
          You know what Olga said before she walked
          out on me? Her last words to me. She
          turned at the front door. Looked around
          the room and she says, "keep it clean."
          That's it, can you believe it? Then out
          the door.

          (BEAT)
          But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place
          spotless... in case she walks through
          that door one day.
          (at Horus; with pain)
          I don't think she's coming back.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger,
          despair, a combination thereof.
          He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands,
          pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach.
          Smiles at him, with impunity. Goes back in.
          On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Fist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus. steadies
          down the hallway. His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red.

          

          

          

          

          85.
          He gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand.
          KNOCK. And again, KNOCK.
          ï¿½ow
          He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed
          second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung.
          The door opens.
          And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with
          one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other.
          Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.

          CLYDE
          The box scores are waiting and I got an
          inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make
          it snappy.

          HORUS
          (loosing his voice)
          I'd like my sports page, please.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          I want you to stop taking my sports page.

          CLYDE
          All right.
          Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck.
          He stutter-steps... KNOCKS...

           CLYDE (CONT' D)

           (AGITATED)
           What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop
           taking your sports page. Now get out of
          here and let me...

          HORUS

          (INTERRUPTS)
          I want today's sports page.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          That there... my sports page.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          CLYDE
          What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden?
          You don't even like football.
          Horus does.not budge.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You'll get it back... after I take my
          dump.
          Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his
          foot in the door.

          HORUS
          No.

          CLYDE
          What?

          HORUS
          No. I would like my sports page now.
          Please.

          CLYDE
          After I finish.

          HORUS
          I'd prefer it now.

          CLYDE
          What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
          Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm
          a kamikaze move, indeed.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (SHOCKED)
          Give that back.
          Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's
          midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the
          massacre commences.
          He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS
          across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if
          Horns accepted it as fate.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          Clyde 'kneels over. Picks up the sports page. And as if yawning,
          returns to his room.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          By the fence - Mary and Aaron.
          Mary, with a brown paper BAG, seems.distant, preoccupied in a
          far away place.

          AARON
          Are you all right, mom?

          MARY

          (DISTRACTED)
          Yeah... why?

          AARON
          You're acting weird.

          MARY
          (didn't hear)
          What?

          AARON
          I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think
          it's time for your nap.
          Aaron leaves.
          Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged,
          disoriented. He confronts an empty apartment.

          HORUS
          Mary!
          A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the
          apartment.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some
          muffled volume.
          Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a
          cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a
          while, one would suspect.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          COP (O.S.)
          Come back here! Stop him!
          In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF.
          The thief dashes by - pass an indifferent Hancock. The cop
          follows suit, passing by.

          COP (CONT'D)
          Stop him!
           Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.

          EXT..STREET - DAY

           Horus stumbles. Keeps his balance. Trudges down the street to a
          corner BAR.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          The bar is empty at this hour. The chairs are up, the floor
          swept. A husky BARTENDER unloads liquor in the back.
          Horus enters. Finds a stool.

          HORUS
          Drink.
          The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Is this a bar... or what? Drink.
          (uncomfortable with his own

          RUDENESS)
          Please.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms.
          It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the
          clouds - they're alive, restless.
          She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.

          HANCOCK
          Hi.

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Thank you for being here.

          MARY
          Is everything all right?

          

          

          

          

          89.
          Hancock has no response.

          U

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (CONCERNED)
          What's wrong?

          HANCOCK
          (constipated; following some

          THOUGHT)
          It's cold.
          Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          (at the clouds)
          They're moving. The turbulence has
          started.

          MARY
          Tell me what's wrong.
          He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
          darkness.

          HANCOCK
          Look out there and what do you see, Mary?

          MARY

          (PERPLEXED)
          Nothing. I don't know... I don't see
          anything.

          HANCOCK
          see it,can
           It's out there. But you can't
          Y nu?
          (beat; holding on to a thread)
          And that's good, not seeing. But for me,
          I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out
          there.

          MARY
          Please, Hancock. What are you talking
          about? What's out there?

          HANCOCK
          Duty.
          (beat; at Mary)
          You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you.
          He'll say: "you do what you have to do."
          Or what? You let the next guy do it for
          you, if you don't... if you can't.
          (losing it)
          And... but. If I can't, then who?

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          90.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          The next guy? No. There is no "I can't."
          Just "I must."
          Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But I don't ask, "why me?" I don't
          question it. This is me. I'm it. I do
          what I have to do. I get in there.., all
          the killing... the blood... and I deal
          with it. I clean up. I make things right.

          (BEAT)
          And. But when.., where does it end?
          (re: his cape)
          Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's
          everywhere. And it stays. All that I can
          do, Mary. The things I am capable of
          doing, I can't blink away the hell I've
          seen. It's in me...
          (points to his head)
          in here and I can't not think about
          it. It's in me. It's me.

          MARY
          Hancock... what...

          HANCOCK
          I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll
          break. I need to get away. Get away to
          where? I don't know.
          (at Mary)
          I need your help.

          MARY
          Me? What can I do?
          (she's helpless)
          What do you want me to do?

          HANCOCK
          I want you to save me.

          MARY
          How?
          Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her.
          Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing
          her senses, pulls away.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Don ' t.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          HANCOCK

          (DESPERATE)
          Save me.

          MARY
          I can't.

          HANCOCK
          You can.
          (the hard sell)

          AND
          Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron.
          what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An
          apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't
          know what I'm doing... what I'm saying
          anymore.

          MARY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          I'm married.
          A pause.

          HANCOCK
          To whom?

          MARY
          I love him.
          The death blow.

          HANCOCK
          No.
          (turns from her)
          Unacceptable.

          MARY
          I love him. I'm sorry.
          One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this
          superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel.
          Mary wants to console... but what can she do?

          HANCOCK
          I'm cold.
          Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          She leaves.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Aaron. The school hallway. He holds a wooden hall PASS,
          indicating that class is in session.
          He swings into the BOYS ROOM.

          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY

          A large restroom - empty. Little Aaron passes up on the urinals.
          Selects a private STALL. ZIP - urination begins.
          Splash segues into drip. DRIP. Aaron shakes off the last drop...

          PLOP.
          And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles
          surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see
          but, from behind, the stall door opens...
          Guess who?
          Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head.
          Introduces it to the yellowed waters below.
          SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the
          next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
          shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range.
          What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked
          laughter.
          The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says...

          THEM

          (MOCKINGLY)
          "Don't mess with me."
          They leave - laughing.

          THEM (CONT'D)
          (in the distant)
          Little shit.
          Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl.
          On the tile floor. A wet rag of piss.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Mary hurries into the room - flustered, adrenaline coursing
          wild.
          She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in
          Horns. The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home.

          MARY
          Horus...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The school front. KIDS swarm into the streets, freshly released
          from captivity. And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and
          soiled in disgrace.
          He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No
          Hancock, anywhere.
          Aaron waits, hopeful.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a WHISKEY BOTTLE in
          his hand. He's been drinking. L"i
          in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
          upper branches of a tree.

          SUE
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Hymie. Come down, Hymie.
          She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.

          SUE (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Mister? My Hymie won't come down from the
          tree.
          Hancock's reaction - "what?"

          SUE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          My pussycat. She won't come down.
          She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent
          eyes.

          

          

          

          

          94.
          So cool, Hancock reaches down for a PEBBLE - takes it in his
          palm. Finds the little pussy named Hymie. And with a simple
          flick of the wrist... shoots it down.
          A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
          limp and lifeless. A THUD we hear on impact.

          SUE (CONT'D)
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Holy fuck.
          Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky.

          EXT. SKY - DAY

          Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to...
          BAM... buildings. He strikes the corner of a brick tower,
          plummeting downward with the dislocated debris.
          He bounces off the concrete -.in an alley.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Mary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be. She checks
          h er watch.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The place is empty. Deserted.
          Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face
          - the abandonment of all hope. Nobody's coming, this is clear.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble.
          He braces the building to get up. Drops. Gets to his feet, only
          to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk.
          We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something
          stiff up his ass.

          REED
          What do we have here? A piece of shit.
          A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that
          superguy.
          Hancock stares at him.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          HANCOCK

          (HUMORLESS)
          Fuck off.
          He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.

          EXT. STREET - DAY


          A
          Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of
          particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives
          chase... and confronts him, out of breath.

          AARON
          (a slight smile)
          Hi.

          HANCOCK
          (turning; drunk)
          What're you doing here?

          AARON
          (the smile fades)
          I saw you walking. Where were you today?
          You said you'd... be there.
          Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.

          HANCOCK
          I don't know what you're talking about.

          AARON
          Where are you going? Can I go?

          HANCOCK
          You don't want to go where I'm going.

          AARON
          Those assholes got me in the bathroom,
          today...
          (trying to hold on)
          and you said you'd pick me up at
          school.
          Hancock turns. He's upset now.

          HANCOCK
          Listen.
          Aaron recoils.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Listen. I'm not here to save you.

          96.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          No, not my job. Don't put that on me.
          (pounds his chest)
          Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal
          with it, kid. You are what you are and...
          what I say, it won't do you any change.
          You'll grow up to be just like-your old
          man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can
          do about it... 'cept grab both ankles,
          hope by the grace of God the reaming's
          gentle.
          Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not
          here to save you.
          He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed
          against the rocks.
          In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          This empty bar.
          With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's
          drying some mugs, let's call him JOEY (30).

          HORUS

          (BOOZED)
          One.more.
          Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it...

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          No... nevermind.
          (going to blow)
          Where's your bathroom?

          JOEY
          (not in my place)
          Bathroom's closed.
          Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.

          HORUS
          How much.

           JOEY

          (SARCASM)
          Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you
          what. I'll take care of this one.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          HORUS
          Thank you.

          JOEY
          The register ain't open yet, anyhow.
          Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash
          for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.

          JOEY (CONT'D)
          Shit.

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          In the armpit of town - Hancock. He lights a cigarette with the
          matchbook Gina had given him earlier.
          At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all
          her glory.

          GINA
          I've been waiting.
          They stare for one horny beat.
          Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking
          for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.

          \./

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The front door opens, but slowly. Aaron steps inside.
          From the kitchen, Mary spots him in his violated condition. He
          sees her reaction, that of shock - and like that, he runs
          s obbing into her arms.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          A phone booth - Gina's office.
          There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and
          Gina, their organs ensnared. They're pumping away. Up. Down.
          A surreal sight, indeed - the red of his cape and the black of
          her leather.

          GINA
          Come on, baby. Relax.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          

          

          

          

          98.

          GINA
          You can.
          The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          GINA
          Let it go, baby. Just let it...

          RING...

          HANCOCK
          (in tears)
          I can't.
          His arm rips through the glass...

          GINA
          . go.

          (ORGASMS)
          Oh god.

          HANCOCK
          I can't!

          RING...
          He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'

          GINA
          Don't give up, now.
          He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.

          EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - NIGHT

          There is movement in the sky above - aggressive formations and
          grooves in clouds once coy and demure. The wind HUMS its
          presence, toys with fallen leaves.

          'INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          It's dinner - but all is not well. Mary and Aaron and an empty
          chair. '
          They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound.
          Between them - a ketchup bottle.
          The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair
          and plops on it... misses... kisses the carpet.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          HORUS
          (on the ground; prone)
          Son. Go to your room.
          Struggles to his knees.

          MARY
          What happened toyou?

          AARON
          Dad, are you wasted?

          MARY
          Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to
          your room.

          AARON
          He is wasted.
          Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa.

          MARY

          (AUTHORITY)
          Go!
          Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          What do you think you're doing, Horus
          Longfellow?
          Horus gauges her.

          HORUS
          Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm
          not your child. I'm your husband.

          MARY
          Horus, what're you talking about?
          (re: bruises)
          Who did this to your face?
          Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.

          HORUS

          (OBLIVIOUS)
          But you didn't know-about me...
          Mary knows where this is headed.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You didn't know I was going to do this to
          you.
          (a half-chuckle)
          I guess I should've known. We were
          married and I knew... at the reception. I
          couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and
          watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and
          I watched you dance. In your white dress.
          And I remember zoning out... for a
          second, just watching you. God, Mary...
          the little girl next door who used to get
          into fist fights with her brothers in
          those patched-up Toughskins. We met only
          'cause the tallest tree in the
          neighborhood was in my backyard and you
          needed to climb it.

          (BEAT)
          But that night. God, you looked so
          beautiful I.had to realize it... how much
          I loved you... one more time.

          (BEAT)
          You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I
          remember I'm watching you there, with
          him... together like that. You looked
          good with him, I thought all of a sudden.
          Like you belong... better. And as I
          stared across the floor, it was the same
          story with all the guys there, that they
          were more right for you.

          (SWALLOWS)
          More right because that night, you walked
          in with the wrong man.

          MARY
          Why do you say that?

          HORUS
          Because I let you down.

          (BEAT)
          I'm a coward. I can't do anything about
          it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front
          of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd
          have to defend you and Aaron. What do I
          do, then? What am I if I can't do that...
          my own wife, family? Not a man.

          you think I was completely blind when I
          married you? Something cuts at your
          masculine ego and it's the pressure...
          the standard's unreasonable. The woman,
          she wants me to part oceans. That's the
          kind of bull shit's made of. I went w

          retrieving his U-Rent Security Jacket. He grabs

          MARY (CONT' D)

          Hancock's POV: a burning hallway, flames spewing from every
          crevice - we're walking through Hell.
          We see a BOY, huddled under a table. Hancock wraps his cape
          around him. Bolts through the inferno... as glass SHATTERS...
          and gas pipes ERUPT.
          He takes the boy to safety. Unwraps the cape... only to see the
          CHARRED remains of a human BODY...

          The room is dark, of course. A BED - as the SQUEAKING of springs

          I don't smoke. What's wrong with you?
          She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV
          reporter, in the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the
          door SLAMS shut.

          Hancock drops his pants.
          Straight-arms the wall with his left. And with his right,
          latches on to his magnanimous member.
          Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed
          against wood - listening.
          So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a
          storm. His body convulses under said stimulation. He GROWLS...
          Cue for the reporter to back away.

          Beat.
          The bathroom door flies open. Hancock emerges, buttoning his

          flesh and bone against the opposite wall. SNAP goes the landing.
          The Hoodlum. Dead.
          Hancock - realization. He hastens to the body... limp... broken.

          What're you doing?

          I'm pissed!
          Out of nowhere - Aaron charges the caped psychotic. He
          trampolines on Hancock's back, trying to saddle him.

          AARON
          Don't you fucking touch her!
          Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says...

          HANCOCK
          Shut your mouth.
          He swats the kid off his back.

          You're getting on my nerves.

          MARY
          Hancock, please.
          He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes
          out of fear for Aaron.

          AARON
          No! Mom!

          MARY
          Stay back, Aaron!

          . but something pulls him back. He reappears, thinking,
          staring at his feet. Destiny awaits him.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILE - NIGHT

          POLICE UNITS flood this once quiet and forgotten block. S.W.A.T.
          teams ooze from vans. COPS kneel behind their cars, guns cocked.
          We SEE Ted Brock - he's on the radio, hammering out orders. He
          looks pissed.
          Rutgers and Adams arrive. They take position next to fellow

          COPS.

          ADAMS
          What's with the Cap? Looks like someone
          just fucked his wife, or something.
          Nervous smiles from the fellas.

          INT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILE - NIGHT

          In the wide expanse of this top floor - Hancock and Mary. He
          squats before her, calm - unperturbed by the activities outside.
          Mary huddles in her spot, occasionally stealing glances outside.
          Hancock simply stares at her. At the curves of her gentle frame.
          The alcohol's wearing off.

          

          

          

          

          INT. WATANABE'S DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

          Scarpo. The Thugs. They sack the emporium, unimpeded.

          INT. BACK DOOR - NIGHT

          The silhouette figure of Horus - it enters the back room,
          bracing the wall for silence. He moves into the store.
          From his vantage, several beams of light slice the darkness they
          indicate the positions of the thugs.
          Horus sneaks in, heads for the second floor.

          INT. SPORTING GOODS SECTION - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Thug #3 peruses this department.
          Moving across the floor on bent knee - Horus, concocting some
          desperate strategy. He moves to the GUN counter. Slips his hand
          underneath and withdraws a hidden KEY.

          LST FLOOR - NIGHT INT. FIP

          Scarpo - stuffing his bag with merchandise. He waves Thug #2
          over.

          SCARPO
          Take the show upstairs.

          INT. SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          The gun counter. Horus loads a .45 - it's foreign to his hand.
           He rolls out in search for Thug #3, who is by the BASEBALL
          aisle. Horus cocks the .45 in pursuit. Sidles up behind him.

           THUG #2 (O. S . )
          (from behind)
          Behind you!
          Thug #3 swings around with a Louisville Slugger - it swipes the
          45 from Horus's hand. Horus "I'm screwed."
          Thug #3 promptly knocks Horus against the BAT rack. Bats roll,
          spray the floor. Thug #3 slips hard on his approach, landing
          heavy on his head.
          Thug #2 comes running, gun raised.fa rusCdives for r a goes oose bat,
          his swing greeting Thug #2 in the

          Horus stands over the two bodies - as surprised as we are.

          INT. FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

          Scarpo - in full alert. He's heard the commotion upstairs.

          SCARPO
          Guys?
          (no answer)
          Fuck me.
          He drops his loot. Heads for the second floor, cocking his gun.

          INT. ELECTRONICS SECTION - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT,

          Thug #1, he's writhing to music under the privacy of headphones -
          unaware of Horus behind him... Thug #1 whirls around with a gun,
          catching Horus off guard.
          Horus responds with a FLASH he had acquired from the camera
          section - the burst of light momentarily blinds the thug.
          And a quick SNAP of the bat takes out Thug #1. Horus dispenses
          of the camera, his adrenaline raging. He commandeers the free
          gun, heads downstairs.
          But the TV stops him... it displays the siege at Killybegs
          Textiles.

          REPORTER
          again, we believe that this is a
          hostage situation. Officials refuse to
          comment but we believe Hancock has
          abducted a woman, the identity of whom we
          do not yet know...
          Horus - a look of horror on his face.

          HORUS
          Mary.
          He's off, slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs. Makes his
          way down to the second floor... where he is greeted by a gun
          NOZZLE, pressed against his temple.

          SCARPO
          You're starting to piss me off.
          He pushes Horus down the remaining steps.

          INT. SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Horus rolls to a halt. Scarpo greets him there...
          pulling him-up by the hair...

          Horus uncoils an accurate kick to Scarpo's groin.
          Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops.
           Horus goes for the gun. A struggle ensues, Scarpo finding Horus to the side.

          Ted "the pissed-off police captain" Brock stands by his vehicle,
          screaming out orders - a BULL HORN in his hand.

          Come on out!
          Hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves.
          He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of
          healing.
          Hancock closes in - corners her.

          MARY
          Please.
          But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his
          hand down her back and between her buttocks.

          Hancock across the face.

          Make it go away, Mary.
          Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him

          And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance.
          First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and
          RIPS the vehicle in half.
          An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning

          mangled bodies.
          Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building.
          From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble,
          heading towards the confrontation. He'passes a mutilated body -
          belonging to Adams.
          A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun
          and stops. He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes
          that no revolver will do. He continues forth.

          Hancock responds to "it."

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          If you've got anything left... inside...
          (hand over heart)
          and you do, I know you do... whatever
          it was that you felt for me... inside...
          then you won't go out there.
          He just looks at her.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Just let go... and it'll go away. Please,
          just let go.

          HANCOCK

          (DESPAIR)
          I can't.

          

          122.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          Horns stands there in the rain - a feeble frame of a man. He
          wants a fight.
          And he gets it... as Hancock, once again, emerges from the
          building - fire in his eyes.

          HANCOCK
          You ready to rock it up?
          Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock
          follows, toying with the man.
          Horus disappears inside.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)
          Come out, you little shit.
          A pause in action - no reply from Horus.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Are you a man?!
          Horus answers...
          He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.
          He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS
          Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the
          brick structure.

          HORUS
          Fuck you.
          Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He
          GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus.
          Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden
          EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall
          loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock.
          CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does
          not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the
          street.
          Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus
          - grabbing him by the collar.
          With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying.
          THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the
          asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.

          

          123.
          He gets up. Tries to walk. Can't.
          Hancock - on the app roach, maintaining a cruel but steady pace
          towards his wounded game.
          Horns tries to crawl. Can't. Too much pain. He peddles back
          against the curb, nowhere left to go.
          Hancock arrives, looking afully steamed. He stands over Horus -
          not unlike Scarpo much
          The situation presents itself - he reacts.
          A kick into Hancock's groin muscle - CHINK, sliikeyt a soundWofshrugs.
          bone off metal. Absolutely harmless. Horus
          else can he do?
          Hancock tears a YIELD street SIGN it backs Ready to strikeï¿½ es
          this piece of jagged metal.


          (CONT' D)

          (DEFIANT)
          No regrets.

          HANCOCK

          (COOL)
          No mercy.
          He takes aim...

          AARON (O.S.)

          NO!
          Mary SCREAMS in the background...
          Horns. Hancock. They turn to witness the de-physicalization of
          Killybegs Textile.
          they begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks... beams...
          and tear of recent artillery.
          Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give. It
          slips... she SCREAMS... and collapses, taking the rest of the
          building with it.
          A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke.
          Mary is no more.

          HORUS

          MARY!
          Aaron. Roheim. In disbelief.
          

          124.

          AARON

          (BLANKLY)
          Mom...
          Horus, he struggles to his feet. Pushes past Hancock, limping
          over to the building that once was.

          HORUS

          MARY!
          Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking
          pale.
          Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to
          excavate his wife - one brick at a time.
          Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.

          ROHEIM (O.S.)
          (you're wasting your time)
          Come on, Horus.
          Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen.
          Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He
          r olls up his sleeve and gets to work.
          Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his
          midst... surveys the carnage...
          A loaded beat.
          Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat.
          Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his
          knees... by a fallen police GUN.

          He picks it up...
          points it at his head...

           FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom
          off skull.
          Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet
          tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a
          surreal sight.
          Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works
          his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb.
          He stops.

          

          126.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Aaron - in his pajamas, creeping down a dark hallway. He
          approaches a DOOR.

          NARRATOR (V.0.)
          sometimes when it's dark out, so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.
          Aaron peers through the open door. His eyes wander inside ever
          so gently.
          On the bed there - HIM... Horns.

          NARRATOR (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          and it starts allover again.
          And Mary. They are in some latter state of coital bliss.
          Horus THRUSTS.
          Mary GASPS...

          NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Some things... you just never forget.

          FADE OUT:



          THE END
