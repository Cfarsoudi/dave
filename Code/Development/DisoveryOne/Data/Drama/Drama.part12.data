               PROLOGUE BLACK SCREEN - SUPERIMPOSE:

                        THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY.

                             IT OCTOBER 6, 1970 ISTANBUL,

                                       TURKEY -

               SOUND UNDER, SHARP: CRACKLE - RIP - SNIP...

               FADE IN:

               A SET OF CLOTHES ON A HOTEL ROOM BED -- trenchcoat, bulky 
               white turtle-neck sweater, T-shirt, jeans, Western style 
               boots.  SOUNDS continue, Accentuated.  MOVE Across open 
               TRAVEL BAGS On The bed.  Clothes, possessions.  CONTINUE 
               Across FURNITURE, WASHBASIN, TOILET...A large room, high 
               old ceilings And windows suggesting Ancient Europe & design, 
               A haunting greenish AFTERNOON light.

               We MOVE to HANDS, TIGHT - drawing out a strip of adhesive 
               tape,

               SCISSORS move in TIGHT...SNIP!

               UNDERARM, TIGHT.  Tape being laid over it.

               BACK OF SHOULDER.  TIGHT.  Tape going on. 

               BELLYBUTTON, TIGHT. TAPE going Then: a harsh RIP! SOUND 
               and the tape comes off the bellybutton.

               HANDS with new strip of tape. Moving to:

               HASHISH PLAQUE. Four of them, thinly pressed. One on top 
               of the other. The HAND wrapping a portion of the TAPE around 
               them and:

               BELLY, TIGHT. SOUNDS of BREATHING stop. The belly is sucked 
               in. The TAPE is pulled HARD across, then CLINCHED.  We 
               hear F.X. of HEART BEAT--

               MOVE UP THE CHEST TO:

               BILLY HAYES - 21, baby-face, attractive, medium build an 
               aura of innocence. His eyes moving off his belly to:

               MIRROR.  FULL SHOT.  Climax.  A creature in a bondage of 
               his own devise, he is naked in his underpants, his body 
               criss-crossed by a network of TAPE and 40 tightly pressed 
               plaques of HASHISH in every conceivable crevice of his 
               body. The eyes are hard.

               NIX THROUGH HEART BEAT, SOUNDS OF AIRPORT.

                                                                    CUT:

               INTERIOR

               ISTANBUL AIR TERMINAL dirty, crowded, wooden benches, 
               peddlers.  Turkish flight instructions on LOUDSPEAKER, 
               followed by mediocre English translations. NOTE: ALL 
               DIALOGUE IN TURKISH TO FOLLOW WILL BE MARKED OFF BY 
               PARENTHESIS. A CERTAIN WILL BE SUBTITLED, BUT SOME NOT.

                                     LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
                         Pan American Flight 1 to Frankfurt, 
                         London, and New York has arrived 
                         and will be ready for boarding at 
                         Gate 7 in 20 minutes.

               REPEAT IN ENGLISH over:

               BILL walking down a long CORRIDOR. He moves somewhat stuffly 
               in the clothes we saw laid out on the bed; his face 
               complicated by dark, rather ridiculous aviator sunglasses 
               and an increasing edge of nervousness to his actions. With 
               him is:

               SUSAN 23, healthy outdoor looks, dressed casually colorful 
               like an American student abroad.

               APPROACHING P.O.V. - a group of TURKISH SECURITY GUARDS, 
               in rumpled green uniforms, at a security CHECKPOINT inspect 
               the carry-on bags of several PASSENGERS.

               BILLY tensely contemplating the guards as he walks.

               SUSAN digging in her bag for her passport as she walks.

               BILLY, looking from guards ahead to SUSAN. He suddenly 
               breaks stride, still a fair distance from the 
               checkpoint. SUSAN glances at him. He is holding his belly.

                                     BILLY
                         I think I've been poisoned.

                                     SUSAN
                         And you ate two baclavas, right? I 
                         not to touch them, mine was awful.

                                     BILLY
                              (his voice strained)
                         Look, I think I'm going to have to 
                         go to the john again.  You go on 
                         through, I'll catch up.

               With a sense of panic, he turns and goes back down the 
               corridor without waiting for a response.  SUSAN concerned, 
               moves on.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY in the  WASHROOM MIRROR, again checks himself out. 
               His glasses are off, and he has just watered himself down. 
               But the SOUND of his HEARTBEAT is up, and his nerves are 
               visible in his eyeballs and he knows it.  He dabs at the 
               sweat on his sideburns.  He closes his eyes, takes a DEEP 
               BREATH.  A pause. He puts his dark sunglasses back on.  
               Turns away from the mirror.  No going back now.

               ADVANCING P.O.V. - SECURITY CHECKPOINT.  The GUARDS again.  
               Closer, closer, Guns in their HOLSTERS. SOUND of billy's 
               heartbeat,

               CLOSE - GUARD smoking a cigarette, bored, uniform, looks 
               at BILLY.

                                                                    CUT:

               The GUARDS again.SOUND of Billy's in a tattered olive

                                     GUARD
                         Passport!

               BILLY PASSPORT. The Guard's tobacco-stained FINGERS take 
               it open it. Basic information on Billy: Birth Date April 
               17, 1949.  Birth Place: Babylon, Long Island. No wife, no 
               minors.  Signature.

               GUARD gives it back to BILLY.

                                     GUARD
                         Bag! 

               BILLY opens his shoulder bag, proffers it. The GUARD tosses 
               it, pushing aside books, grabbing a white plastic dish.

                                     GUARD
                         Nebu? 

                                     BILLY
                              (Understand the 
                              Turkish expression, 
                              "What's this?")
                         It's a frisbee.

                                     GUARD
                         Nebu? 

                                     BILLY
                         A Frisbee.
                              (makes a throwing 
                              gesture of the 
                              wrist)
                         You throw, catch it.  Game! 

               Curious, one of the other GUARDS ambles over looking at 
               the frisbee.

               BILLY tightens. Cursing the frisbee. Sweat now runs his 
               sideburns again.  HEARTBEAT up.

                                     2ND GUARD
                         American game. Baseball.

                                     GUARD
                         Ah! 
                              (puzzled, turns the 
                              Frisbee around and 
                              around)

               THE SECOND GUARD studies BILLY curious about the sweat. 
               Suddenly reaches up, indicates the eyes.

                                     GUARD
                         Take off the glasses.

               BILLY understanding the gesture rather than the words, 
               removes his glasses. His eyes. Straight, staring at the 
               GUARD without trying to look away. A long moment.

               FIRST GUARD stuffs the frisbee back into the bag. Scowls.  
               Takes a puff on his cigarette, coughs. Phlegm rattles around 
               in his throat.  

               Reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on a crowded 
               olive-colored out on the tarmac She has saved him a seat 
               and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down.

                                     FIRST GUARD
                         Aaaah! 

               He waves BILLY through.

               BILLY puts his glasses walks past the back the SECOND GUARD 
               turns away.  BILLY walks past the Checkpoint. His HEARTBEAT 
               drops.

               SUSAN reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on an  
               crowded olive-colored BUS out on the tarmac.  She has save 
               him a seat and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down.

                                     SUSAN
                         Are you all right?

               He looks at her. Relief. A smile, awkward - he wishes he 
               could tell her.

                                     BILLY
                         Yeah... Yeah. 

               Lays his head back on the wooden bench. Reaches out:

               TAKES HER HAND in his. She returns the grip.

               THE BUS DOOR slams shut.

               THE TURKISH BUS DRIVER rolls the bus out towards the PLANES 
               visible in the far distance?.

               SUSAN, feeling Billy is better, shows him the Herald 
               Tribune.

                                     SUSAN
                              (saddened)
                         D'you see this?  Janis Joplin died 
                         yesterday.

               BILLY, his sunglasses removed, looks at the paper, almost 
               abstractedly.

                                     SUSAN (OFF)
                         Overdose, in a Hollywood motel.

               NEWSPAPER Picture of JANIS JOPLIN.  That big, earthy, rugged 
               smile.

               BILLY'S P.O.V. - Moves Up page One To The Headline: NIXON 
               OUT-RAGED AT PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS: CALLS FOR CAPITAL 
               PUNISHMENT

                                     SUSAN
                              (a faint voice)
                         Never Was anybody like Janis.

               BILLY, thinking other happier things, reaches over and 
               playful!.:squeezes her tit twice, rapidly.

                                     BILLY
                              (smiles)
                         Never was anybody like you...

                                     SUSAN
                              (annoyed, brushes 
                              his hand away ,a 
                              clicking sound in 
                              her throat)
                         You can't take anything seriously.

                                     BILLY
                              (smiles)
                         You're right.

               Bus stops suddenly. BILLY changes expression.

               THROUGH FRONT WINDSHIELD we see TURKISH SOLDIERS in several 
               HALFTRACKS drawn up in a semicircle blocking the bus. The 
               Pan American PLANE is directly behind. Also JEEPS and a 
               POLICEMAN waving the bus down.

               BUS BOOR opens and the Turkish Police OFFICER hops aboard 
               briskly:

                                     OFFICER
                         Attention please, Ladies and 
                         Gentlemen. For your own safety 
                         we're conducting a security check 
                         before you board your airplane, 
                         Kindly file out the back. Women 
                         and children in one line. Men in 
                         another.

               PASSENGERS.  A confused hum.

                                     VARIOUS PASSENGERS
                         What's he saying?  I don't know... 
                         Marian.  Hey Marian, what the 
                         hell...

               The Turkish-speaking PASSENGERS are gathering together 
               their items and beginning to exit as:

               POLICE OFFICER repeats, in ENGLISH

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Idem. 

               CLOSE BILLY. The POLICE OFFICER is only beginning the 
               speech.in English but already Billy realizes, And it's 
               panic.  Silent panic. That horrendous cold feeling all 
               over his back: Oh God what have I done, what can I do now?  
               He freezes.

               MOVE TO SUSAN rising, fetching her things, irritated.

                                     SUSAN
                         Jesus, they do everything ass 
                         backwards in Turkey.

               Behind her we see the other AMERICAN PASSENGERS beginning 
               to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped 
               conversations, expletives, including:

                                     PASSENGERS
                         They're checking for hijackers.  
                         Any Palestinians aboard? Hey Harry, 
                         get rid of your grenades...

               Laughter is returned from several of the American 
               contingent, but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground; all 
               of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the 
               seat.

                                     SUSAN (OFF)
                         Billy, what's the matter?

                                     BILLY
                         My passport!

                                     SUSAN
                         No! 

               She bends down to look, coming FACE TO FACE with him. He 
               grips her arm.

                                     BILLY
                              (low voice)
                         Susan - forget it. Go get us a 
                         seat on the plane. Now.

                                     SUSAN
                              (picking up the 
                              real fear in his 
                              voice)
                         What is it? . . . Billy?

                                     BILLY
                              (a fierce whisper, 
                              panic)
                         For Christ's sake, just GET on the 
                         plane, okay!

               His tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like 
               that.  A LOOK between them; he has his glasses off now. 
               She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something 
               is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do 
               exactly as he says. And fast.  She moves OUT OF SHOT.

               BILLY, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his 
               finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work 
               the TAPE loose from around his chest; looking from under 
               the bench. Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers 
               are exiting. BUT THEN:

               BILLY P.O.V. - UNIFORMED LEGS coming slowly down Isle 
               Towards him. The muzzle of An M-l RIFLE tapping loosely 
               Against the side of the kneecap.

               PAN WITH and MOVE UP as TURKISH MILITARY LIEUTENANT comes 
               into view, intersecting outgoing PASSENGERS, eyes casually 
               coming to rest on:

               BILLY looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his 
               sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his 
               hand. "Just found it" expression.

               MOVE to the LIEUTENANT not necessarily suspecting anything, 
               but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant-
               types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand 
               and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed 
               under his chin. MOVE BACK to the OFFICER, bringing the 
               rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus 
               with the others. All in silence.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into two 
               lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table. 
               Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area. It is 
               open, vast, no place to run or hide. The only apparent 
               hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of 
               the passengers impatiently waiting.

               TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the table, 
               body-searching the male passengers alternately.

               SUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with FEMALE 
               ATTENDANTS doing the searching. She glances at Billy as 
               she undergoes search. She is cleared, passes on, towards 
               the ramp of the plane.

               BILLY, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male 
               PASSENGERS pulling some books from his shoulder bag.  Glides 
               to the head of the line. MOVE TO:

               The FIRST OFFICER patting down a PASSENGER, his back 
               partially turned to Billy. MOVE AROUND bringing him into 
               foreground as:

               BILLY skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two 
               other conversing PASSENGERS waiting for the SECOND OFFICER 
               who now appears in foreground on the lateral TRACK; he is 
               busy with another passenger. In passing him, Billy replaces 
               the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already 
               been searched by the first officer,

               Tension. FOLLOW BILLY as he approaches the boarding ramp.

               BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN at the top of the ramp waiting.  
               Smiling STEWARDESSES. Pan America. Haven.

               BILLY - FOOT rising off Turkish soil onto ramp.

               TURKISH HAND lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping 
               the ARM.

                                     TURK (OFF)
                         Just a minute!

               BILLY his eyes flattening.

               SUSAN in LONG SHOT, reacting.

               BILLY turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the SECOND 
               OFFICER face to face and gestures towards the:

               FIRST OFFICER who happens to glance at them.

                                     SECOND
                         Nebu? Did you search him?

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (frowns)
                         No!

               SECOND OFFICER tightens his grip on BILLY, angry, and pulls 
               him back to the TABLE. MOVE with them. The officer has 
               been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about 
               eighteen.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         (grunts a command, makes a gesture)

               BILLY, comprehending, spreads his arms.  The OFFICER pats 
               him down carefully, brushing against his armpits. Precisely 
               in the area where we saw the hashish. But incredibly he 
               doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips 
               and legs.

               CLOSE BILLY eyes on the sky behind the OFFICER, praying 
               silently for a break.

               TURKISH FINGERS moving up the inside of his legs, onto his 
               belly, touching the hard bulge below the navel. But again 
               not noticing.

               BILLY in limbo, SOUND of his heartbeat.

               SECOND OFFICER pausing, his fingers around Billy's chest, 
               about to let it go, then:

               PLACES HIS HAND suddenly flat on Billy's heart.

               OFFICER, sensing the accelerated Heartbeat, stares at:

               BILLY whose eyes jump, startled by this technique.

               FINGERS like excited spiders quickly run back up into the 
               armpit area.  STOP - right on the packets.

               TURKISH EYES SWIVEL to BILLY EYES CLOSE. Frozen moment.  
               Then, sudden blur of movement at the edge of frame.

               SECOND OFFICER jumping back, grabbing his pistol from his 
               holster, crouching on one knee, aiming the gun barrel at 
               BILLY, hand shaking. He is terrified.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                              (screaming)
                         Bomb!  He's got a bomb!

               AMERICAN PASSENGERS scream and the deck all around.

                                     AMERICAN PASSENGER
                         Bomb!  Bomb! 

               BILLY stands there, arms straight up in the air, eyes 
               clamped shut, trying not to breathe. CHORUS of rifle and 
               revolver CLICKS OFF as:

               PULL BACK to OVERHEAD SHOT BILLY surrounded by thirty 
               SOLDIERS with rifles pointed at him from all directions, 
               crouched nervously. The PASSENGERS all huddled on the 
               ground.

               BILLY, eyes closed. Edge of frame shows a shaky muzzle a 
               REVOLVER poked into his belly, moving up.

               MOVE to THE FIRST OFFICER, older, more experienced but 
               scared, poking with the revolver; reaches in with his hand 
               cautiously, starts to pull up the turtleneck sweater. MOVE 
               with the hand, revealing the HASHISH PLAQUES around the 
               navel. A pause. His HAND draws the sweater higher.  More 
               PLAQUES.

               FIRST OFFICER'S FACE relaxes. Starts to smile, finding it 
               funny. 

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (yells out)
                         It's hashish. just a smuggler.

                                     SOLDIERS (OFF)
                              (in chorus echo, 
                              relaxing, chuckling)
                         Hashish...smuggler...hippy... 

               MASTER ANGLE SOLDIERS REGROUPING. PASSENGERS starting to 
               rise from the ground.  

               SUSAN dumbfounded watching all this from the door of the 
               PLANE, starts back down the ramp. But a flow of upcoming 
               PASSENGERS slows her descent.

               BILLY is led roughly by TWO SOLDIERS parallel to the plane 
               his hands on his head. He manages a glance at Susan. A 
               slight but strong movement of the head and eyes. 'No. Don't 
               come down the stairs'

               SUSAN understands it, looks helplessly, hesitates lost 
               between two worlds. A silent shaping of a puzzled mouth.

                                     SUSAN
                         ...Billy...?

               She is washed back along in the flow of passengers.

                                                                    CUT:

               VIP ROOM AIRPORT LOUNGE.  The scene moves very fast, 
               Indicating A sense of chaos.  Much smoke.  Many phone calls. 
               Half A dozen Turkish police OFFICERS Are bizarrely seated 
               In A row of fold up chairs next to A desk. Chattering among 
               themselves (AD LIB) lighting their Turkish cigarettes. 
               They hardly pay attention as:

               MOVE TO BILLY, scared, sweating - backlit by the huge 
               windows overlooking the airstrip. In background, we see 
               the 707 Pan American PLANE beginning to circle towards the 
               runway.  GUARDS have stripped him down to his bare chest 
               and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at 
               once. Then RIP the tape off.  BILLY winces.

               ANOTHER ANGLE the room. Billy's luggage Is being Tossed.  
               Clothes fly through the air. A sweatshirt; Marquette 
               University Rowing Team. A 35mm camera. A gift package for 
               his mother ripped open.  A silver Turkish kettle, clanging 
               To The floor. Another package is ripped open and a set of 
               Turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor. Very 
               fast.

               BILLY watches, bewildered. He is stripped of the last plaque 
               in of the confusion is that each time another police officer

               his navel. FOLLOW the plaque clattering onto the pile of 
               forty plaques.

                                     FIRSTOFFICER (OFF)
                         Name?

                                     BILLY (OFF)
                         William Hayes.

               MOVE BACK QUICKLY to the OFFICER with notebook at the desk.  
               Part of the confusion is that each time we see another 
               police officer we see he has another face.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                         Vi... Vilyum... Vilyum...

                                     BILLY (OFF)
                         Hayes.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                         Hi-yes...
                              (writes it down)

               ANOTHER ANGLE --

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                         'Merican?

                                     BILLY
                              (nods)
                         New York.

               The OFFICER is puzzled.

                                     BILLY
                         New York... New York...

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                         Ahhhh...Nev Yok!
                              (writes it down)

               A LOUD SOUND OFF.

               The DOOR flies open and ANOTHER OFFICER strides in.  
               Paunchy, moustached. The room is suddenly silent as we 
               TRACK him in, followed by a grinning civilian FLUNKY with 
               a big portable photo instrument and bulb.

               THE FIRST OFFICER jumps up from the desk, makes an 
               obsequious salute to the SECOND OFFICER who arrogantly 
               acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the 
               desk. The FIRST OFFICER moves to the first fold-up chair 
               in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further 
               down. THIS OFFICER, in turn, shoves the next man down. It 
               goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the 
               last man in the row stands up against the wall. But this 
               is all in the background as:

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Name?

                                     BILLY
                         William Hayes.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Vil... Vilyum...?

                                     BILLY
                         Hayes...

               Sharp SOUND OFF of FILM BEING RIPPED FROM CAMERA. He darts 
               a look at

               POLICEMAN stretching the undeveloped film out.  Another 
               loud SOUND OFF, interrupting this--

               THE DOOR flies open again and a THIRD OFFICER strides in, 
               obviously the most important yet, because the SECOND OFFICER 
               jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately 
               move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's 
               hesitation. But the THIRD OFFICER strides right up to Billy, 
               waves to the SECOND OFFICER.  THE CAMERAMAN in background 
               bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. Billy is 
               puzzled - what's going on?  His arm is grabbed and he is 
               swivelled around.

               REVERSE ANGLE - OVER CAMERAMAN

               BILLY in the middle, flanked by SECOND and THIRD OFFICER, 
               grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders. 
               The FIRST OFFICER, sticking a bunch of hashish plaques 
               into Billy's hands, runs OUT OF FRAME. BILLY looks from 
               side to side. The SECOND OFFICER pats him hard on the back 
               of the head, meaning 'look at camera'. BILLY glances at 
               him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces. Thinking 
               this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera.

               CAMERAMAN disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece.

                                     CAMERAMAN
                         No.. He's smiling. Make him look 
                         miserable.

               SECOND OFFICER slugs BILLY in the stomach with a quick 
               back-handed fist. BILLY groans, sinks to his knees. The 
               plaques fall on the floor.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (running up)
                         Gel?  Gel??

               He growls, grabbing Billy's arm and hauling him up, 
               gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his 
               arms. The TWO OFFICERS put their arms back on Billy's 
               shoulders. BILLY, in pain, makes the proper expression of 
               misery.

               FLASH!  The bulb goes.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE 707 PAN AMERICAN PLANE, destination New York, roars up 
               into the sky. PULL BACK all the way to BILLY sitting next 
               to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near 
               vomiting.  He glimpses the plane but it is anti-climatic 
               now; as he stares down at his boots. Then remembers 
               something! Surprised.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM. The Turkish OFFICERS talk AD LIB 
               among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders, 
               pointing to the hashish plaques, etc.  

               In center background, we see BILLY submissively lifting 
               his arm for permission to speak,

               THIRD OFFICER nods, approaches, followed by OTHERS.

               BILLY slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his 
               boots, bangs it on the heel and two more PLAQUES clatter 
               to the floor.

               TURKISH MOUTHS drop open.

               BILLY finishes the process with the other boot. An awkward 
               silence OFF.

                                     BILLY
                              (trying to explain, 
                              innocent)
                         I forgot... I really did.
                              (makes ineffective 
                              gestures)

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The room explodes with screams and commotion.  
               AD LIB:

                                     THIRD OFFICER
                              (screaming at SECOND 
                              OFFICER)
                         You idiot, you fool. You told me 
                         the American was searched... and 
                         he's pulling hashish out of his 
                         boots!  You're all dogshit!

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                              (turning on First 
                              Officer, screaming)
                         You worthless piece of garbage, 
                         where did you learn to search a 
                         prisoner?  He's been in our custody 
                         for an hour, etc.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (screaming at the 
                              others)
                         Who searched him?  Who?

               Amid all the screaming TWO POLICEMEN rush over and yank 
               BILLY upwards, and start to strip all his clothes.

                                     BILLY
                              (protesting)
                         That's it! That's all I have!

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY spread-eagled STARK NAKED against the wall. He is 
               afraid to move. A strange silence.

               ANOTHER ANGLE. BILLY naked in center B.G. against the 
               wall.The OFFICERS and SOLDIERS quietly leering at his trim, 
               muscular buttocks. Hungry stares.  Bisexuality is prevalent 
               in Turkey.But there is also embarrassment among the 
               officers; none would do anything openly in front of the 
               others; instead they just stare and smoke their cigarettes.  
               Low murmurs. Continued telephone calls. Much thick smoke 
               all over the room.

               Another DOOR opens OFF. Obsequious GREETINGS in Turkish.

               BILLY is afraid to look over his shoulder, feeling 
               enormously humiliated.

                                     VOICE (OFF)
                         Howdy, Billy. Howya doing, Ok?

               A perfect Texas drawl. BILLY glances over his shoulder. 
               Sees:

               TEX a tall, lanky blonde-haired American in a business 
               suit with boots. Clean cut, very handsome, with a strong 
               flavour of danger in his blue eyes.

                                     TEX
                              (smiling, extends 
                              Billy's clothes)
                         I think these gentlemen have 
                         finished for the time being if 
                         you'd like to put your clothes on.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, so grateful at last to see a fellow 
               American, reaches quietly for the clothes, his eyes never 
               leaving Tex. Release?

                                                                    CUT:

               TURKISH DETECTIVE sits at the main desk in the room.  Unlike 
               the others, he has no moustache; a skeletal face, 
               intelligent looking.  TEX Is behind, leaning casually up 
               against the wall. Angled to Billy's side is the entire 
               array of seated OFFICERS looking on like a tribunal.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (thickly accented 
                              English, sympathetic)
                         Are you afraid, Vilyum?

               BILLY, standing to the side of the desk, clothed now, 
               buckling his belt - afraid.

                                     BILLY
                         No, I'm not afraid.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Good. There's nothing to be afraid 
                         of. If you co-operate with us, you 
                         will be on the plane for New York 
                         tomorrow... yes?

                                     BILLY
                              (softly, hoping)
                         Yes...?

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Good. Now, where did you get the 
                         hashish?

                                     BILLY
                         A cabdriver. He picked me up in 
                         the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Would you recognize him again?

                                     BILLY
                         Yes.  I think so.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Good.  Would you go back to the 
                         Pudding Shoppe now and point him 
                         out to my men if you see him?

               BILLY'S EYES MOVE TO: 

               TEX who makes a cool affirmative nod of the eyes to Billy.

                                     BILLY (OFF)
                         Yes.

               STREETS, ISTANBUL, AFTERNOON. TEX drives his American CAR; 
               BILLY in the passenger seat; TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN

                              (sweating)
                         But it was my first time. I'm not 
                         really a smuggler, was just two 
                         kilos.

                                     TEX
                         Well, you see Billy, it don't really 
                         matter right now if it's 2 kilos 
                         or 200 kilos. The Turks love to 
                         catch any foreigner smuggling - it 
                         shows the world they're fighting 
                         the drug trade.

                         But just...

                         I just needed some extra money.  I 
                         was broke, the guy offered me the 
                         hash and...

               It sounds bad. Tex looks at him without expression. 
               Pause.Billy tries to sense a sympathy in this ambiguous 
               man, a liking towards himself. But feels nothing yet, except 
               someone who can speak English.

                                     BILLY
                         ...are you with the Consulate?

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY nervously takes the pack and matches.

                         How much did you figure to make?

               BILLY fumbles to light up his cigarette. He is nervous, 
               grateful to volunteer any information...anything.

                                     BILLY
                         Three, four thousand...I don't 
                         know.  The guy offered me the hash--
                              (shakes his head)
                         ...it just seemed like easy money.

               TEX grins, sceptical of his naivete, changing the subject.

               THE PUDDING SHOPPE TWILIGHT Internationally-known cafe, 
               adjacent BAZAAR. Crowded, noisy. WOMEN dressed in black 
               hold crying CHILDREN by the hands. FOREIGNERS, mostly 
               students and hippies, move about laughing, joking. Hawkers,

               BILLY sits at a small outdoor TABLE alone sipping tea and 
               eating baclava - nervous, very nervous, still trying to 
               sort it all out in his head. If he doesn't find the seller,

               MOVE across the TABLES, past a middle-aged AMERICAN COUPLE,

                         'em some dope.

               MOVE ON to another TABLE where TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN 
               sit, equally evident, watching BILLY.

               TEX sits in his car, in the distance, casually glancing at 
               a newspaper.

               BILLY's eyes rove.

               INTERIOR PUDDING SHOPPE Large. Many tables. Stairs. A back 
               exit.

               ANOTHER GYPSY BOY leads a huge PINK PIG leashed with a 
               wooden sign around its neck proclaiming "Pig" in Turkish. 
               Various TURKS point the pig out, laughing at it, some 
               disgusted by it, making faces and gestures: "Go way, go 
               way!  "Ayip!"  The PIG moves past BILLY, who shifts his 
               gaze to:

               POV - CABDRIVER #1 lingering at the curb. PAN to CABDRIVER 
               #2  PAN to CABDRIVER #3. PAN BACK to #1 and again to #2 
               indicating no real fix on identity.

               BILLY tense now, knowing this is the chance he must take, 
               nods with his head, pointing at CABDRIVER #2, off.

               THE PLAINCLOTHESMEN move out towards CABDRIVER #2.

               BILLY tentatively rises, as if to join them, but moves 
               slyly towards the interior of the cafe.

               PLAINCLOTHESMEN move in roughly on a surprised CABDRIVER 
               #2 who begins to protest LOUDLY (AD LIB).

               BILLY moves through the INTERIOR of the PUDDING SHOPPE, 
               past the tables, past the stairs, towards the back of the 
               shop, at a normal.to attract attention.  

               A PLAINCLOTHESMAN looks around, sees he is gone. Tells the 
               others (AD LIB) They spread out looking, abandoning the 
               CABDRIVER #2 who spits and curses them (AD LIB).  

               BILLY, with one backward glance, now eases out the BACK 
               DOOR, into a bilious sunlight, onto a STREET. Pause.

               A HAND with GUN moves into FRAME pointing a six-inch barrel 
               right at his temple.  BILLY freezes, moving just his eyes 
               to:

               TEX looking down at him calm, merciless.

                                     TEX
                         You seem like a nice enough kid to 
                         me Billy, but try it and I'll blow 
                         your fucking brains out.

               BILLY - the sense of betrayal in his eyes.

                         Dear Mom and Dad. This is the 
                         hardest letter I've ever had to 
                         write. know the confusion and the 
                         pain it will cause you.  And the 
                         disappointment...

               BILLY - his scalp being shaved off by a prison BARBER in 
               an un-specified ANTI-CHAMBER, His eyes are staring dead 
               ahead.

                                     BILLY VOICE
                              (continuous)
                         I really thought knew what I was 
                         doing with my life. I'd hoped 
                         somehow to get out of this quickly 
                         so that you'd never know about it. 
                         But that just isn't possible now. 
                         I don't know what's going to happen.  
                         But what can I say to you?  Will 
                         'I'm sorry' make a difference?  
                         Will it ease the pain, the shame 
                         you must be feeling?  Forgive 
                         me...Please...

               BILLY is now completely BALD, SOUND SHARP OVER:

                                                                    CUT:

               A CELL DOOR SLIDING OPEN. BILLY steps in, bewildered.

                                     ZIAT VOICE (OFF)
                         Git!

               The cell is dark, almost black, an overpowering stench; a 
               small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy 
               mattress. BILLY turns, looking back at the man staring at 
               him from the door.

               ZIAT is quickly summing up Billy's character. This is his 
               craft.He is a prisoner and trustee. sinister man whose one 
               motivation in life is the accumulation of money, in the 
               pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish SCAR 
               running the width of his throat, various other facial SCARS; 
               and one blind milky white EYE. He's stocky and strong --
               about five ten, with bushy eyebrows, brown cigarette teeth, 
               big dirty nails, repulsively in need of a bath. What's 
               surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old 
               looks and behaves like sixty. The personification of the 
               denaturalization of a man. Time, body, mind - all of them 
               warped.

               BILLY, not yet attuned to his nature, only repulsed, is 
               still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture, 
               enunciating very clearly, hoping he will understand.

                                     BILLY
                         Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket?  
                         Blanket?
                              (makes a gesture of 
                              a blanket wrapped 
                              around him)

               ZIAT smiles, showing his stained teeth, and starts to slide 
               shut the cell door on its ROLLER.

                                     ZIAT
                              (in English)
                         Mo sell...Too late.  Tomorrow...

               A cobra smile flashes, as the cell door bangs shut.

                                     ZIAT
                              (through the bars)
                         You be here tomorrow.  "Ayi 
                         Gedjaler"("good night")

               Goes.

               BILLY walks around the cell, hugging himself for warmth.

                                     VOICE (OFF)
                         Pssst!

               BILLY stops, goes to the edge of the cell.

               A BONY BARE ARM motions from the bars of the cell next to 
               his.  We never see the face but hear a thick ITALIAN ACCENT, 
               hoarse and cracked.

                                     VOICE (OFF)
                         (Whispering) 
                         Your cell, no key.  Open...!  
                         Blanket. Three cell down. You get 
                         me one. Take...

               Extends a stick with a big nail pounded into the end, 
               twisted over to form a hook.

               BILLY takes it. Hesitates.

                                     VOICE (OFF)
                         Ziat go for night.  Go!

               BILLY cautiously slides the cell door open, amazed that 
               it's been left open.  Nothing makes any sense to him in 
               this labyrinth

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY steps out into a WALKWAY. A bare 
               bulb overhead casts light. He glides past the three cells, 
               seemingly empty.  Finds the cell with blankets, sheets, 
               towels and various supplies stacked inside.  But it's 
               locked.  He slips the stick in between the bars and 
               stretching, hooks the first blanket.

               BILLY asleep with the blankets pulled up to his chin.  
               Suddenly DIRTY HANDS reach into frame and rip the blanket 
               off. WIDEN TO:

                                     ZIAT
                              (tugging the sheet, 
                              growls)
                         Brack!...Brack! 

               Then SLAPS at BILLY. BILLY ducks away. Encouraged, ZIAT 
               steps up closer to him, sticks his fingers in his chest 
               screaming.

                                     ZIAT
                         You, goddamn you, give me sheet.  
                         Give me! 

               And feints as if to hit BILLY again. BILLY reacts to defend 
               himself, pushing ZIAT off and jumping out of the bunk.  

               ZIAT, Enraged by the shove, comes back at BILLY, screaming, 
               arms flailing like a bear to pummel him, but BILLY, not 
               understanding the Turkish bluster in his mannerisms, meets 
               him with a sharp right FIST into the front of his face.  

               ZIAT staggers back, startled into silence; he has misjudged 
               this kid.

               BILLY waits, ready for the fight in the defensive position. 
               The guy is bigger than himself.  ZIAT, however, now feels 
               the blood from his mouth and nose and freaks out, running 
               out of the cell SCREAMING at the top of his lungs as if 
               he's dying.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY is blindfolded, stumbling down stone steps pushed by 
               a GUARD, into a dungeon-like basement room. THE PUNISHMENT 
               CELLS.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE GUARD removes the blindfold. BILLY, adjusting to the 
               light, stares around. The cell is spartan, with a series 
               of pulleys and primitive bondage devices hanging from the 
               cobwebbed ceiling.A DOOR opens and:

               HAMIDOU STEPS in, lowering his head to get through the 
               door.Chief of the guards. A clean uniform.  Four stripes. 
               The only guard to carry a holstered gun. very frightening 
               man. He is about six two, two forty, and muscular, and 
               moves lightly like a fighter on his feet.  His skull is 
               bullet-shaped and completely shaven like Billy's, Enhancing 
               this effect, he has no eyebrows, and his pale blue eyes 
               (suggesting a trace of Indo-European stock in his ancestry) 
               are set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes, giving 
               nothing away. His nose is a beak of skin his neck broad, 
               his mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his 
               feet between anger and amusement. He approaches BILLY, 
               looks into his eyes, drawing out the moment for himself, 
               enjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others.

               BILLY meets his eyes respectfully, then realizing this is 
               perhaps not the thing do to, looks away. But, fascinated 
               by the man's features beyond his self-control, he looks 
               back.  

               HAMIDOU, amused by eye actions, smiles thinly. The sort of 
               smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm.

                                     HAMIDOU
                              (to one of the guards)
                         Name?

                                     GUARD
                              (checking a clipboard)
                         Vilyum Hi-yes

                                     HAMIDOU
                              (looking at BILLY, 
                              repeating it)
                         Vilyum Hi-yes...   

               And slowly his hand moves up to caress the edge of his 
               hairless upper lip. An erotic gesture in Turkey.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         Vilyum Hi-yes

               "Its in my memory locked."  He slowly extends his right 
               arm stiff out to his side.

               BILLY watches, fascinated.

               HAMIDOU lets the arm linger; then:

               SMASHES BILLY across the face with an open palm. BILLY 
               shoots back: and smashes against the wall just from the 
               force of one blow.  Stunned.

               HAMIDOU advances, taking a wooden CLUB (FALUKA STICK) about 
               feet three long and three inches wide from a GUARD.

               BILLY scared, emphasizing the words, trying to make himself 
               understood.

                                     BILLY
                         It was cold. Cold! I get blanket.  
                         Blanket! Cold!

               THWACK!

               BILLY'S LEG BUCKLES, where the faluka stick has just smashed 
               him behind the kneecap. He SCREAMS going down.

               BILLY looks up from the floor:

               HAMIDOU with his club in hand.

                                     HAMIDOU
                              (In some sort of 
                              English, smiles)
                         No do. No do.

               Raises the club.

               BILLY tries to block it with his hand, and the CLUB smashes 
               his thumb.  SCREAM.

                                                              SHARP CUT:

               BILLY is hoisted upside-down in his UNDERPANTS ONLY with 
               thick rope tied about his ankles, the legs spread - onto a 
               PULLEY suspended from the ceiling. He is yanked upwards, 
               then lowered slightly, his head and backs of shoulders 
               banging against the stone floor.

               THE PULLEY is LOCKED into place.  (LOUD SOUND)

               BILLY has this surprised look on his face still, through 
               the tears.  What's happening? 
                

               Hamidou motions the GUARDS out of the room (AD LIB).  Turns 
               back to BILLY, raises his club.

               BRINGS IT DOWN FORCE on the soles of BILLY'S BARE FEET.  
               SCREAM.  He cocks the club again.

               BILLY twists To avoid The blow

               CLUB catches him On The ANKLEBONE

               BILLY SCREAMs louder than ever as we hear The SOUND of 
               wood On bone.  Whimpering SOUNDS follow.

               BILLY looking through teary eyes, sure now that he is going 
               to be killed. The CLUB - OFF - smacks sole skin with the 
               same force as the first blow. No let up.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY still in the same position, vomits all over himself.

               HAMIDOU SPINS the PULLEY to a new position bringing:

               BILLY into a steeper, more vertical position.  He is on 
               the verge of fainting, bleary-eyed, looking as:

               HAMIDOU moves around in between his legs. Doing something 
               indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping 
               the stick. Then, with this bizarrely excited expression on 
               his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants. But, 
               for Billy, it all BLURS OUT TO:

               JAPANESE SILK SCREEN depicting a fat jovial Buddhist monk, 
               fishing placidly by a stream. Then moves to soap carvings 
               of chess pieces Then a bed-sheet hung as a curtain with 
               astrological symbols paint; on it.  SOUND OFF, of a blaring 
               radio.  Atonal TURKISH MUSIC.

                                     VOICE
                              (close, intense)
                         Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his 
                         feet gonna swell up worse.

                                     2ND VOICE
                              (softer, sonorous, 
                              Swedish accent)
                         We take him down to courtyard...

               Then: ERICH - a gentle long bird's face. Long whitish-blond-
               hair, Swedish, well above six feet, 25.

               Another FACE moves into view JIMMY BELL, American, 23 fiery 
               eyes, black hair and moustache, intense, strong.

                                     BELL
                         Smoke this rocket, it'll cool the 
                         pain.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BELL puts a huge cone-shaped JOINT with 
               aluminium foil filter into BILLY'S LIPS. He hardly knows 
               what it is, Puffing weakly. Though dehydrated and his face 
               white without color, he has no facial markings.

                                     BELL
                         You gotta walk around some man, or 
                         your feet gonna swell up something 
                         bad...

               BILLY looks down at 

               HIS FEET Bloated black and blue with inflamed red points 
               in various spots. A vicious bruise on his anklebone. ERICH 
               is running a cold rag from a basin of water over them, his 
               fingers tender.

                                     BELL (OVER)
                         You've been out for days man, 
                         talking all kinds of shit. Come 
                         on, we'll walk you down to the 
                         courtyard.

               BELL eases BILLY up from the bed, as ERICH puts a pair of 
               clip-clops on his feet.

                                     ERICH
                         Okay?

               BILLY nods. They rise together, bracing his shoulder.  
               BILLY adjusting to the sensation of standing.

                                     ERICH
                         How's it feel?

                                     BILLY
                              (dizzy)
                         About as good as it looks.

                                     BELL
                         Getchmis olsun

                                     BILLY
                         Getchmis...? 

                                     BELL
                         Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm 
                         Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich 
                         something Swedish.

                                     ERICH
                              (smiling)
                         Just Erich.

                                     BILLY
                         I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used 
                         to be.

               Looks around.

               A DORMITORY TYPE ROOM with 24 bunk beds set head to head 
               in horizontal fashion, cramped and with minimal privacy. A 
               narrow WALKWAY leading towards a TOILET AREA and STAIRCASE.

                                     BILLY
                         Looks like a cheap hotel.

                                     BELL
                         Yeah... Only the room service is 
                         lousy.  Come on, let me show you 
                         the tennis courts.

               Helps him with ERICH to take the first steps.

               THE COURTYARD. The THREE of them emerge in a thin AFTERNOON 
               sun, Billy now disengaging and hobbling on his own power.

                                     ERICH
                              (watching Billy 
                              limp)
                         Feeling all right?

                                     BILLY
                              (still groggy)
                         Yeah.  That guy who beat me?
                              (stops, slightly 
                              puzzled)
                         I feel stoned.

                                     BELL
                              (grins, interjects)
                         'Figgers.

                                     BILLY
                              (vague, going on)
                         ...He had a bald skull and...

                                     BELL
                         Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards.  
                         Don't fuck with him. He almost 
                         killed an Italian dude couple months 
                         ago.  Bad news. He try anything 
                         with you?

               BILLY glances at him, understanding. Pause.

                                     BILLY
                         No... I don't remember.

               Glances at ERICH.

                                     BELL
                         With these fucking Turks, soon as 
                         the light goes out... I keep one 
                         hand on their feet and their feet 
                         better not grow.  You'll meet Max. 
                         He got raped something bad down in 
                         Section 13. That's the pits.

               THE COURTYARD

               VARIOUS ANGLES The yard is 30 by 50 paces with a wall 20 
               feet high. Cigarette butts, orange peels crumpled news-
               papers, rocks, sticks, broken glass litter the place.  No 
               guards are on the walls; the only GUARDS are unarmed 
               inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the 
               prisoners with whom they intermingle; they have raggedy 
               olive green uniforms and worn boots (they make $1 a month, 
               augmented by bribes).  On one side of the yard is a 2-story 
               ROGUS (cellblock) with barred windows from which Billy and 
               his two companions have just emerged.  On the other side 
               of the yard is another 2-story KOGUS (the children's kogus).

               The COURTYARD is colorful, almost like a bazaar, about 8O 
               people in it - groups of exotically dressed AFRICANS, 
               AFGHANS, ARABS, MALAYSIANS, EUROPEANS, and predominantly 
               TURKS pacing back and forth talking in little circles, 
               hawking wares, trading illegal currencies.

               Screaming Turkish STREET URCHINS 10-14 years old, share 
               the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising 
               viciousness, continually hitting each other and cursing. A 
               bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game.

               Other aspects of the prison which should become evident: 
               1) NOISE - continuous, Loud. Radios, Turkish music, 
               screaming, shouting.  2) CATS - all kinds, some of them 
               pets, some stray, tolerated because they kill the rats. 3) 
               THE PRISONERS all wear their own clothing; the foreigners 
               preferring jeans, clip-clops, sneakers, Sweat suits. 4) 
               THE HEADS of only the new prisoners are shaved, then allowed 
               to grow back. 5) MANY PRISONERS have physical disabilities. 
               Carbuncles on the back from wet mattresses. Boils on the 
               lymph glands around the neck, buttocks, under-arms, 
               sometimes SO painful the victim walks with his arms up in 
               the air.  Arthritic in the knees, hips, ankles. Fungus on 
               the feet.  Many limp.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PRISONERS glance at BILLY as he walks, 
               noting the beating he has taken and sizing him up, then 
               going on with their business.

                                     BILLY
                         The kids? Why are they...

                                     BELL
                              (snorts)
                         Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, 
                         pickpockets, murderers, you name 
                         it - they do it. Don't trust any 
                         of 'em...

               BELL's eyes follow a knot of KIDS to:

               ZIAT has a window open on the FIRST FLOOR KOGUS and is 
               selling little cups of tea to the kids from inside where 
               he works a GAS STOVE. The kids push and punch each other 
               to get the tea faster.

                                     BELL (OVER)
                         ...They tell Ziat everything. He's 
                         the squeal round here. Goes all 
                         over the prison.  Sells watered-
                         down tea, blankets, hash, black 
                         money, nembutols --anything for a 
                         buck...

               ZIAT leaves the stove in the hands of an ASSISTANT and 
               moves down the window to a particularly gaudy AFGHANI a 
               fierce hawk-faced old man with a chunk of his ear missing. 
               He wears a colorful flowing robe, various scarves, turban, 
               trinkets, rings, baggy pants, and pointed curved shoes, 
               and makes emphatic violent gestures at ZIAT with his 
               mutilated THREE FINGERS.  ZIAT Seems to speak something of 
               his language and bargains back.

                                     BELL
                              (continuous)
                         He was an informer on the outside 
                         but he tried to screw the cops out 
                         of 60 kilos of opium. Watch him, 
                         he's a fox.

               BILLY says nothing to them about the Ziat incident, sizing 
               him up for himself.

               THE AFGHANI having concluded the deal with ZIAT reaches 
               deep into his layers of clothing around his crotch and 
               pulls out several scrofulous $10 bills which discreetly 
               takes in exchange for a thick wad of Turkish currency, his 
               eyes moving around, stopping on BILLY. A hooded look.

                                     BELL (OVER)
                         Whatcha' in for, smuggling? Rash?

               BILLY turning his eyes away from ZIAT 

                                     BILLY
                         Yeah.

                         ...ain't nobody who's innocent.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - all the color and breath seems to have 
               gone from BILLY.

               BELL snorts, amused, kicking the SOCCER BALL away hard as

               HAMIDOU looks on, intrigued by the Father and Son; leaves 
               silently, closing the door.

               FATHER looks into his son's eyes, his own eyes moistening.  
               He looks tired, pain all over his face.

               fractured English,

                                     YESIL
                         Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.

                                     BILLY
                         Mr. Yesil.

                                     YESIL
                         I know exactly what you feel but 
                         you must not worry, we are acting 
                         immediately, we get the right court, 
                         the right judge,  I arrange 
                         everything - just right.  And I 
                         think we get you bail. If very 
                         bad, maybe twenty month sentence... 
                         But I think we get you bail...

               Pause, BILLY looks at him wondering how to take him in.

                                     YESIL
                              (reassuringly)
                         You know I have lectured at the 
                         University of Maryland in your 
                         country?  Also University Michigan 
                         Very nice country. We both go back.
                              (smiles)

                                     BILLY
                              (trying to 
                              concentrate)
                         If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they 
                         say it's easy to cross the border 
                         into Greece?

                                     FATHER
                              (pacing up, hungry)
                         Right!  That's what we're shooting 
                         for.  Mister Davis and have been 
                         in contact with the State 
                         Department, but right now relations 
                         with the Turks aren't too good, 
                         Nixon's upset the hell out of them.  
                         Our best bet's... right here.

                                     BILLY
                         Dad...
                              (pauses, glances at 
                              Davis and Yesil, 
                              embarrassed)
                         I'll pay you back for all this, I 
                         Promise. 

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     FATHER
                         Don't worry about it.  Right now 
                         money doesn't count. Okay?

               A pause. YESIL Shifts, Throats are cleared. BILLY moves to 
               sit down, limping faintly; he is wearing sneakers and the 
               bruises don't show.

                                     FATHER
                         Where'd you get that limp?

                                     BILLY
                              (not wanting to 
                              alarm him)
                         Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.

               Sits down at the conference TABLE.

                                     BILLY
                         Where you staying, Dad?

                                     FATHER
                              (pulls up a seat 
                              next to Billy)
                         The Hilton.

                                     BILLY
                         How do you like it?  Istanbul?

                                     FATHER
                         Well, it's an interesting place...
                              (lowers his voice, 
                              a hint of a smile)
                         Tell you the truth, I think the 
                         food is lousy. The crap they sell 
                         in these little restaurants. I 
                         went out to eat in one of them 
                         last night, and I had to run to 
                         the damn toilet... You shoulda' 
                         seen the toilet.

               BILLY laughs.

                                     BILLY
                         You mean you got toilets?

               FATHER is happy to see his son laugh.

                                     FATHER
                         Yeah, with real toilet paper - and 
                         you don't have to use both sides.

               BILLY laughs again.

                                     FATHER
                         So now I'm eating at the Hilton 
                         every night.

               BILLY smiles. A pause. A worried look returns to the 
               Father's face

                                     FATHER
                         Why'd you do it, Billy?

                                     BILLY
                         For the money...
                              (Looks away))

                                     FATHER
                              (sighs)
                         I know you kids smoke that stuff, 
                         and we drink booze, but taking it 
                         across a border - it was stupid, 
                         Billy. Stupid.

                                     BILLY
                         I know.

               Glances at DAVIS, YESIL back to his father, his voice 
               beginning to tremble, ashamed of himself for letting it 
               show.

                                     BILLY
                         Dad get me out of here.

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The FATHER understands the desperation in 
               his voice, puts his hand on his son's.

               FATHER I promise you, Billy. Just sit tight and don't.. 
               DON'T do anything stupid.  Let me work with Mr. Yesil and 
               Mr. Davis.  We'll get you out... Okay?  Billy, okay?

               All the assurance of the world is written in this kindly 
               Irishman's face.

               BILLY feels it.

               BILLY being led by TWO GUARDS down a huge arched CORRIDOR 
               in the COURTROOM BUILDING.

                                     BILLY
                         Okay.

                                                                    CUT:

                                     PROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER)
                         THE world is now looking at Turkey. 
                         We are called the Heroin Supplier 
                         of the world.  Stories about us 
                         are in newspapers and on television 
                         every day all around the world. 
                         The time has come, your Honor, to 
                         alter this image before we find 
                         ourselves isolated and morally 
                         ostracized by the rest of the human 
                         race...

               THE COURTROOM - monolithic, frightening, immense with cross-
               currents of greenish light from the enormous windows.  
               People seem insignificant.

               THE PROSECUTOR, wearing dark green glasses, continues, 
               scowling, gesturing profusely at:

               BILLY in the PRISONERS DOCK, baroque design, isolated.  
               Doesn't understand a thing, Erich's extra-large blue pin-
               striped suit makes him look rather absurd.

               HIS FATHER, CONSUL DAVIS, YESIL and ANOTHER LAWYER are 
               seated together at the defence table conferring in low 
               tones with each other. YESIL looks over at BILLY with a 
               big reassuring grin, nods his head - nothing to worry about.

               TURKISH GIRL from the Press with a yellow legal pad, makes 
               notes in the Spectator Gallery. Her legs flare out from a 
               short skirt.

               BILLY pries his eyes away to:

               PROSECUTOR continuing in front of the THREE JUDGES high on 
               an Alice in Wonderland podium wearing long black robes 
               with scarlet collars. One of the Judges is bald, the other 
               has his eyes closed, could be asleep. The CHIEF JUDGE in 
               the middle has a sagging somewhat kindly face and short 
               grey hair.  A YOUNG MAN below the podium, is clacking at 
               an ancient typewriter on a small table.

                                     PROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER)
                              (continuous)
                         ...We must alter this image by 
                         punishing only our own drug 
                         smugglers-but by handing out 
                         foreigners who infest our culture 
                         with their depravity ungodly and 
                         behavior.  We must start now - by 
                         sentencing this American, Vilyum 
                         Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence 
                         for smuggling, to be held up to 
                         the light of the world as an example 
                         of Turkish justice and its intention 
                         to halt the drug trade once and 
                         for all.. .I ask the Court therefore 
                         to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life 
                         Imprisonment. 
                         

               He sits, staring malignantly at BILLY.

               THE JUDGES rise.

                                     JUDGE
                         Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court 
                         will now recess to consider its 
                         verdict.

               The JUDGES exit.

               ANOTHER ANGLE, General commotion in the courtroom as people 
               move about. The FATHER and DAVIS and the OTHER LAWYER 
               consult among themselves, the FATHER vigorously nodding 
               his head.  YESIL approaches BILLY.

               BILLY leans forward anxiously in the dock.

                                     BILLY
                         What'd the Prosecutor say?

                                     YESIL
                              (hurried)
                         It's not important, just technical 
                         things. We make our case.  You 
                         were very good, you spoke well.  
                         The Judge like you. It look good. 
                         Don't worry.

                                     BILLY
                              (pressing)
                         Did you ask for bail?

               But YESIL is called over by the other LAWYER and hurries 
               off.  A SOLDIER comes over and sits BILLY down.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE CHIEF JUDGE puts on his glasses, stands to read the 
               verdict.

               YESIL, standing with the OTHERS, motions BILLY to rise.

               BILLY rises, tense.

               FATHER looks over at him, manages a reassuring smile.

               JUDGE continuing, after preliminaries:

                                     JUDGE
                         The Defendant has been found guilty 
                         by the Court of the illegal 
                         possession of Hashish...

               PROSECUTOR, his expression souring, makes a gesture of 
               defeat. We wanted a conviction for smuggling, not 
               possession.

               BILLY, not understanding sees the Prosecutor's gesture, 
               and a hint of hope crosses his expression.

               JUDGE puts the paper away, looks at BILLY directly.

                                     JUDGE
                         ...Therefore. this court sentences 
                         you, Vilyum Hi-yes to be imprisoned 
                         at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of 
                         four years and two months. This 
                         Case is now closed.

               BILLY looking at the JUDGE doesn't understand. Thinks he 
               might be free.  But suddenly TWO SOLDIERS move in, and 
               start chaining his hands together. He is bewildered, looking 
               at:

               YESIL hastily conferring with Billy's FATHER, more concerned 
               about making a good impression with him than with Billy.

                                     YESILF
                         Four years, two months. It's good.

                                     FATHER
                              (stunned)
                         Four years!

                                     YESIL
                              (quickly)
                         We appeal it.

               BILLY watching this, a lost look.

               FATHER is too shocked to do anything but look at YESIL who 
               continues on:

                                     YESIL
                         You will see, he will have maybe 
                         one year taken off this sentence 
                         for good behaviour. Remember, it 
                         is only for possession; the 
                         prosecutor wanted life sentence 
                         for smuggling...
                              (a smile)
                         To be honest Mr. Hayes, it is a 
                         great victory!

               BILLY is forcibly removed from the DOCK - in chains.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE FATHER, in the same CONFERENCE ROOM,

                                     FATHER
                              (embarrassed)
                         ...With good time Billy it works 
                         out to about 3 years... then there's 
                         the appeal.  Yesil, Davis, they're 
                         all working for you We're going to  
                         try to make a deal to get you 
                         transferred to a Stateside prison. 
                         And Davis thinks there might be a 
                         political amnesty any month...

               Stops. Knows it sounds bad.

               BILLY looks down.

                                     FATHER
                         Look - I know it sounds tough, 
                         Billy, but we're gonna get you 
                         out...

               FATHER grips BILLY by the arm hard.

                                     FATHER
                         ...I promise you, but I don't want 
                         you to get stupid again. Pull 
                         anything.  They can play with your 
                         sentence.

               BILLY nods, acquiescent.

                                     FATTIER
                              (his voice starting 
                              to crack)
                         I'm putting $500 in the bank for 
                         you.  Anything you need you write...

               BILLY nods.  His FATHER points to a stack of ITEMS on the 
               conference table, picks up a cigarette carton.

                                     FATHER
                         There's food, candy, writing paper, 
                         soap, books...
                              (his eyes start to 
                              water)
                         ...cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush, 
                         there's... Jesus!
                              (cracks, throws 
                              down the cigarette 
                              carton)
                         I been writing insurance policies 
                         on people for thirty goddamn 
                         years...
                              (laughs and cries 
                              at the same time)
                         And now I gotta see my own 
                         son...Jesus! Jesus!  If I could be 
                         where you are Billy, I'd be there... 
                         Goddamn Jesus!  These bastards.

               HUGS HIS SON BILLY is on the verge of tears.

                                     BILLY
                         DAD! 

                                     FATHER
                         Oh Jesus! 
                              (sobbing)

               HAMIDOU enters the room. A morbid curiosity in his 
               expression about this show of grief. Watches a few moments, 
               then indicating the visit is over, he taps his falaka stick 
               lightly a few times on the hollow door.  THWACK!  THWACK!

               FATHER breaks the embrace with BILLY, tears streaking his 
               cheeks. Silently indicates for him to "Go, go Fast."

               BILLY goes, past HAMIDOU

               FATHER shaking his finger at HAMIDOU

                                     FATHER
                         You take good care of my boy, you 
                         hear, or I'll have your fucking 
                         head, you Turkish bastard!

               It sputters out of his mouth, senseless to:

               HAMIDOU who closes the door. He has an angry glint in his 
               eye.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY lies on his bunk at night deeply depressed, paler.  
               Candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls. A 
               PHOTO of SUSAN taken outdoors with a mountain range in the 
               background, is on his wall with various SOAP CARVINGS of 
               little chess piece she has designed.

               In the distance, very faintly coming upwards into our sound 
               consciousness we hear a TRAIN WHISTLING in the night, on 
               an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls. Two 
               whistles.  Chugging. Then passing off. The Midnight Express.

                                     BILLY'S VOICE
                         Dear Susan.  1970 has now passed 
                         into 1971.  You can drift in here 
                         and never know you're gone. You 
                         can fade so far out and you don't 
                         know where you are anymore or where 
                         anything else is...

               The CAMERA DRIFTS around the SECOND STORY KOGUS revealing 
               the sleepers: ERICH, BELL, MAX...

                         I find loneliness is a physical 
                         pain which hurts all over; you 
                         can't isolate it in one part of 
                         your body. I so much need your 
                         softness, your strength. I have

               The CAMERA LINGERS on ZIAT in a far corner of the Kogus, 
               top bunk, against a wall.  Never secure, he shuffles in 
               his sleep.

                         ...I feel myself drifting more 
                         heavily into smoking hashish. The 
                         haze helps the time pass. Also I 
                         do soap carvings.  Erich taught 
                         me. And I have been learning Turkish 
                         because it helps me to deal with 
                         the guards and the prisoners. I'm 
                         trying hard to maintain some sort 
                         of schedule to my life, but 
                         sometimes it seems like I'm just 
                         trying in order to try...

               ZIAT is evidently awake he pulls his RADIO over into the 
               bed, and peering around to make sure no one is watching, 
               here moves the screws from the back of it, pulls off the 
               cover and puts in a sheaf of large denomination GERMAN 
               MARKS: inside we briefly glimpse a wad of different-colored 
               CURRENCIES stacked with rubber bands.

                                                                    CUT:

               COURTYARD. Volleyball game in progress. ERICH is tall and 
               plays with dexterous grace. BILLY is fast, agile. BELL is 
               muscular, intense, his hits power-packed.

                                     BILLY'S VOICE
                              (continuous)
                         ... In the daytimes we sometimes 
                         play volleyball against the big 
                         Turkish gangsters...

               THE THREE they play against are hilarious looking in this 
               context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms 
               and screaming at each other, disorganized. Ever conscious 
               of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but play 
               in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves, 
               shiny slacks, black pointed pumps. The boys wear shorts 
               and sneakers. On the sidelines we see a group of PRISONERS 
               laying bets and shouting encouragement.

               BILLY leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the 
               TURKISH OPPONENT backs off, he dinks the ball in just over 
               the net; the Turk SCREAMS his teammates scream at him.

                                                                    CUT:

               BELL goes up for another ball close to the net and really 
               SMASHES it with all his might, and:

               BALL bangs right into the eye of a TURK who flails his 
               arms and SCREAMS with pain, very theatrical.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE SAME TURK now swaggers around the COURTYARD, wearing 
               sunglasses so no one will see his black eye.

                                     BILLY'S VOICE
                         ...To the Turks all foreigners are 
                         "ayip" - unclean, dirty. We don't 
                         shave our under-arms or around our 
                         crotch...

               BELL across the pointyard grins at him and points him out 
               to BILLY, and ERICH.

                                     BILLY VOICE

                         Even the yoga I sometimes do is 
                         "ayip" - too suggestive...

               THE TURK scowls back at BELL, huddles menacingly with 
               another TURK. 
               

                                     BILLY'S VOICE

                         And you're never supposed to eat 
                         with your left hand. You know why?
                         Because that's what they use to 
                         wipe their asses with instead of 
                         toilet paper.  And yet they hate 
                         pigs. There are no pigs in Turkey. 
                         They're considered dirty...

               BELL, smirking at the Turk, turns and walks away.

                         So is homosexuality. That's a big 
                         crime here but most of them do it 
                         every chance they get.  There are 
                         about a thousand things that are 
                         "ayip".  But they're really so 
                         hypocritical, like children breaking 
                         the rules. For instance...

               Suddenly a CRY OFF and:

               THE TURK runs up, pulling a sharp SHIV from his pants, and 
               using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly STABS BELL in 
               the ass and backs of his thighs. One, two, three, four, 
               five QUICK STABS, like a cook hammering veal. In spite of 
               its violence, the action seems like slapstick.

               BELL tumbles to the ground, crying out.

               THE TURK stashes the shiv and disappears among his FRIENDS, 
               his honor restored.

               BILLY and ERICH run over to help BELL who is obviously 
               more in pain than in danger.

                         the but not above the waist because 
                         that's intent to kill. So everybody 
                         runs around stabbing everyone else 
                         in the ass.  That's what they call 
                         'Turkish revenge'.  There's also a 
                         lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite 
                         Turkish word for bribery...

               LONG SHOT - HAMIDOU and ASLAN the young fat Turkish gangster 
               pointed out previously by Erich, are taking tea together 
               in the FIRST STORY KOGUS alone except for ZIATR and 
               Hamidou's two FAT SONS, 7 and 8 years old, both dressed in 
               little suits listening politely as Hamidou gestures to 
               them, in couched terms. The voices are distant and, after 
               a few beats, UNDER BILLY'S VOICE:

                                     HAMIDOU
                         Unfortunately my youngest son Arief 
                         is having problems with his teeth; 
                         he needs braces, but dentists are 
                         so expensive these days

                         Poor kid... You know I have a 
                         friend, a very good friend; he's a 
                         dentist; maybe he could get you 
                         some braces at a... reasonable 
                         price.

                              his hands, shaking 
                              his head))
                         Oh, no...it's out of the

                         the "Baksheesh" in return...

               A BURLAP BAG comes flying over the WALL of the COURTYARD 
               late at NIGHT. Then another comes over, lands in the yard. 
               one is around.

                         Dope and all kinds of shipments 
                         get delivered to Aslan, who re-
                         sells it through his runners. People 
                         like Ziat.  But one night, it 
                         backfired...

               A THIRD BAG comes over, gets caught on a hooknail and rips 
               right open. HUNDREDS of yellow PILLS spill out.

                                                                    CUT:

               COURTYARD.  The SUN is just coming up in the East.  PRAYER 
               can be heard in the distance. Thousands of bombers are 
               scattered all over the courtyard.

                         There were thousands of yellow 
                         nembutols.  Aslan as usual had the 
                         privilege of going into the 
                         courtyard before anybody else to 
                         pick up his stuff but...

               ASLAN arguing vehemently with a GUARD, in his ragged 
               uniform, who won't open the cell of the FIRST FLOOR KOGUS 
               into the courtyard.

                              (continuous)
                         ...it happened to be a new guard 
                         that day and he didn't understand 
                         the system.

                                     GUARD
                         No. It's too early.

                                     ASLAN
                         Open the fucking Gate, you asshole!  
                         Do you know who I am? You want to 
                         get in trouble!

                                     GUARD
                              (angry)
                         Hey, I your mother! Get back to 
                         your bunk.

               ASLAN, red in the face, steps back, suddenly pulling out a 
               little REVOLVER. He promptly shoots the GUARD in both legs 
               and stalks back towards his bunk.

                                                                    CUT:

               PRISONERS rushing out into the COURTYARD, scrambling for 
               the windfall of free nembutols.

               THE PRISON DIRECTOR, A balding unimpressive looking man in 
               a western suit, is calling up the circular stone STAIRS to 
               the second story Kogus from the first story.  With him are 
               several GUARDS, equally reluctant to move forward.  Hamidou 
               is absent.

                                     PRISON DIRECTOR
                         Aslan...be reasonable. Come down 
                         and talk.

                         Aslan... if you give up the gun, 
                         you can keep the bullets

               A PHOTOGRAPHER, seedy looking, readies a big old fashioned 
               box of a CAMERA.  He snaps the shutter on:

                         ...I know all this must sound crazy

                                                                    CUT:

               ASLAN and a group of FELLOW GANGSTERS, all impeccably 
               dressed and grinning for camera, fresh from their victory.

               BILLY, ERICH, MAX, form their own group; in contrast to 
               the Turks, none of them are smiling, MAX has his YOUNG CAT 
               in hand.  The PHOTOGRAPHER is lining up his shot, posing 
               them like actors.

                                     BILLY

                         Everything is "sula-bula" which 
                         means "like this, like that" - you 
                         never know what will happen. One 
                         day one of the new kids was raped 
                         in the children's kogus, so they 
                         picked out six of the worst kids...

               COURTYARD. GUARDS pull out SIX KIDS by the ears from a 
               line-up.

                                                                    CUT:

               CLOSE KID being pinned onto his back on the floor in 
               CHILDREN'S KOGUS: then he is bent over double by a wooden 
               bench; and TWO GUARDS sit on each end of the bench, holding 
               him down.  A silence,

               HAMIDOU appears in a hat and mohair suit with narrow lapels, 
               accompanied by his two little fat SONS, also in their Sunday 
               best. With a ceremonious solemnity, HAMIDOU takes off his 
               jacket, hat, vest, hands them to his sons.

               BILLY watches through the WINDOW with OTHER PRISONERS.

               HAMIDOU is passed a falaka stick.  He raises it high in 
               the air and begins to whack at the buttocks, legs, and 
               feet of the SCREAMING KID.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - On this cue, the five GUARDS on the other 
               benches begin whacking away; the KIDS squirm, scream, 
               struggle but the GUARDS sitting on the of the benches brace 
               their legs farther apart to keep their balance, In immediate 
               background, the other KIDS watch, scared.

               THE TWO SONS with wide-eyed but passive expressions, stare 
               at their father at work.

               HAMIDOU beating his VICTIM, screams out: 

                                     HAMIDOU
                         PIS!  PIS" 
                         ("Obscene, filthy")

               Then stops.

               BILLY WATCHES AS:

               HAMIDOU is handed back his vest, jacket and hat by his 
               SONS: Puts them on ever so neatly and leads them off as if 
               on a Sunday stroll leaving the CRYING behind. On their 
               backs, we hear, placidly:

                                     HAMIDOU
                         You see Mamur, Mamet - what happens 
                         when you're not a good boy.

                         Then there's Ziat.  The more I 
                         know of him...

                                                                    CUT:

               TEN DOLLAR BILL exchanging HANDS. The dirty nails of ZIAT 
               clutch the bill, waving it to the candlelight to see if it 
               is authentic his milky white EYE across the BILL.  He is 
               next to his bunk at night.

                                     BILLY VOICE
                         ...the more hate him.

               MAX and BILLY are next to him, MAX eagerly gouging with 
               his knife into a small bar of SOAP:

               PULLS out a ball of HASHISH inside, neatly concealed. Brings 
               it up to his NOSE, sniffing.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY is watching with glazed eyes - stoned.  
               Approving of the $10, tucks it into his belly cloth looking 
               over and scowling at:

               MAX'S YOUNG CAT on his bunk scratching playfully at one of 
               his wool sweaters.

               ANOTHER ANGLE MAX holding the ball of hash:

                                     MAX
                         Ten dollars for this shit?  You 
                         greedy one-eyed git.

                                     ZIAT
                         NO!   Is good!
                              (gets his English 
                              wrong)
                         Me good shit.
                              (Meaning my shit is 
                              good)

                                     MAX
                         No!  You big shit! 

               ZIAT thinking MAX is correcting his English, nods and 
               repeats:

                                     ZIAT
                         Yeah! Efe big shit.

               BILLY and MAX snigger and ZIAT realizes they are making 
               fun of him.  He hates that and suddenly reaches over and:

                                     ZIAT
                         JAAAASH! 

               SHAKES THE CAT hard off his bunk. A SQUEAL from the cat.

               MAX surprised, glares at Ziat.

                                     MAX
                         You asshole! 

               Then hurries after it, calling its name...

                                     MAX
                         Hikmet come here boy.  Hikmet

               ZIAT shrugs. So what?

                         hell is it?

                                     ZIAT
                         Cat, ah!  Ayip!

                              then lets it go)
                         Look, you don't fuck with me, I 
                         don't fuck with you, right?

                                     BILLY
                         But you fuck with me. You fuck 
                         with me all the time. You make 
                         crummy tea.  You rip us off on the 
                         hash.

                         I make special tea for you, Hiyes, 
                         okay?  We've to live like brothers.  
                         We have to be in here together.

                                     BILLY
                              (tired of it)
                         Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money 
                         you have, you have nothing!

               ZIAT grins, shrugs, squats and fiddles with his keys and 
               footlocker.

                                     ZIAT
                         You 'Merican.  You don't know.

               BILLY watches, repulsed and fascinated.

                                     BILLY
                         Know what?

                         Was..
                              (makes gesture with 
                              his fingers)
                         ...seven years old. I was on street 
                         in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to 
                         take care. I learn.

                                     BILLY
                         Learn what?

               ZIAT shrugs. He thinks BILLY is an idiot.  

                                     ZIAT
                         Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other 
                         man before he fuck you.
                              (grins)
                         And you must fuck last.

                                     BILLY
                         That's a great philosophy.

                                     ZIAT
                              (shakes his head)
                         You 'Merican.  You don't know.

               MAX has followed his cat down to the end of the floor but 
               it has run up into a rafter which he cannot reach. He calls 
               up.

                                     MAX
                         Here Hikmet!  Come down here boy!  
                         Hikmet...

               RAFTER Nothing.

               Max gives up.

                                     MAX
                         Sodding cat! 

               He shuffles off back to his bunk.

               THE CAT is back on ZIAT'S BUNK - NIGHT scratching with his 
               paw around the radio. of the neck, hard. Suddenly he is 
               GRABBED by the scruff  of the neck, hard.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY jerks up from his bunk as he the hears a loud, 
               piercing SCREECH, OFF, echoing through the Kogus.  Then 
               silence.

                                                                    CUT:

               ZIAT, industrious as always, is preparing his tea on the 
               three burners of the small bottled gas' stove in THE 
               KITCHEN, FIRST FLOOR Kogus; needless to say the area is 
               filthy with scraps all over the floor, cats and two large 
               wooden eating tables occupied by some PRISONERS. The Kitchen 
               opens up in background into a WASHING ROOM with SINK. It 
               is EARLY MORNING - Muslim CHANTING OFF,

               THREE TURKISH PRISONERS walk in, talking (AD LIB), followed 
               by MAX stoned, who shuffles over to the table, about to 
               sit, sees something.

               HIS CAT, dead stabbed, and lying there neglected in the 
               corner, just another scrap ready to be swept out.

               ZIAT calmly pours the tea for the table, paying MAX no 
               attention, an excellent actor. Prominently seated, however, 
               is a GUARD. 

               MAX quietly glares at ZIAT and the Guard but says nothing; 
               he has been in prison long enough to know how to hold it 
               in.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               MAX - silently walks over and gently picks up the corpse 
               in his arms, starts to walk out.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY listening impassively to:

               YESIL the lawyer. They are in a booth in the VISITING 
               CAMBER.  Bars separate prisoner and visitor.

                                     YESIL
                              (smiling)
                         The new American Ambassador here 
                         is following your case very closely.  
                         He says there is progress. But 
                         there is another route that is 
                         quite possible...
                              (lowers his voice 
                              and leans close)
                         ...For the proper amount of money 
                         it is possible I can convince 
                         certain officials to lose track of 
                         your papers before the High Court 
                         in Ankara confirms the sentence of 
                         the Lower Court in Istanbul... You 
                         would not exist; and you could be 
                         in Greece by the time the Turkish 
                         courts discovered a stupid clerical 
                         mistake...But I have to act before 
                         the official sentence is handed 
                         down, and for that I must pay 
                         certain officials in advance...

               BILLY closes his eyes as YESIL'S VOICE drones on, explaining 
               the details, the cast, the simplicity Of it,  FADING OUT 
               UNDER:

               BILLY walking the COURTYARD counting his paces 48, 49, 50 
               Turns, goes back.

                                     SUSAN'S VOICE
                         ...My dearest Billy. I know it is 
                         long and it is hard for you, but 
                         your family and I are thinking 
                         about you all the time. I am trying 
                         hard to make enough money nights 
                         to come and see you.  Your father 
                         says that lawyer Yesil wants another 
                         $2000.  I know you distrust him 
                         more and more, but your father 
                         wants to do everything he can, and 
                         he is borrowing all he can on the 
                         mortgage of the house.  Money seems 
                         to be the only way out of there. 
                         Except of course the other way...

               BILLY, MAX and BELL (bandaged around the ass from the 
               stabbing) are huddled around BELL's BUNK late NIGHT candle 
               burning, a sheet sealing off some of the kogus. Bell 
               furtively looks around, pulling out and elaborately 
               unfolding a set of DRAWINGS from a pack of letters.

                         Nor are your parents. They consulted 
                         the priest, and he said to send 
                         you money for that reason would be 
                         like sealing your death.

                         The prison, man. There was this 
                         German cat an architect in the 
                         hospital. He was helping the Turks 
                         build some shit round the place.  
                         I laid some bread on him and he 
                         let me copy them.

               BILLY, puzzled, turns the drawings upside-down, sideways.

               THE DRAWINGS are a lunatic mess of scrambled lines, dots, 
               crosses.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               MAX and BILLY, trying to follow the map, look at each other 
               dubiously.

                         used to keep weapons and stuff, 
                         but beneath that there's these old 
                         catacombs that the Christians built 
                         'bout a thousand fucking years ago 
                         to bury their dead.  We're sitting

                         The Kraut said there's a whole

                         than digging through a wall.  Ziat's 
                         round there all the time. But the 
                         roof....
                              (looks up)

               P.O.V. - THE ROOF, its edges visible over the courtyard.

               BILLY shakes his head.

                                     BILLY
                         The bullet percentage is awful 
                         high.

               A pause. BILLY looks away from BELL'S stare.

                                     BILLY
                         If I get caught, Jimmy, I'm facing 
                         another months. I'd be back up to 
                         3 years, maybe more...

               Looks down.

               BELL understands, deeply disappointed.

                                     BELL
                         Well fuck it!  Choose your own 
                         death, babe, I'm taking the roof 
                         out of here!

               Bell leaves:

                                                                    CUT:

               A LONG DUNGEON CORRIDOR at the end of it, the frame of a 
               small; DOOR, cracks of light at its edges. TRACK IN - F.X. 
               of a siren, capture and now BEATING - heavy beating from 
               behind that door.  CLOSER we reach it. The door FLIES OPEN 
               and HAMIDOU is glimpsed lighting a cigarette. Like a surreal 
               dream, his hand holding the match has a thick LEATHER THONG 
               bound around its knuckles and blood speckled on his fingers.

               A BLUR of foreground movement a GUARD coming out the door - 
               dragging:

               BELL by the hair across the floor. His face contorting in 
               agony.

                         Dear Susan. Poor Jimmy was caught 
                         and beaten so badly he got a severe 
                         hernia and lost a testicle. He's 
                         been in the hospital for months 
                         having operations..

                         very small. But two and a half 
                         years have now gone by, and in 
                         their own fashion, the Turks are 
                         slowly draining my life away...

               WIDEN to a STONE CHAMBER and a crazy looking DENTIST in a 
               filthy long white smock, puffing on a cigarette holder, 
               his ashes falling over Billy as he works his mouth. A 
               motorized drill is plugged into the wall, adjacent a filthy 
               spittoon covered with blood; dried blood is spattered 
               liberally around the chamber.

               BILLY spits out the blood and looks in the mirror.

                                     BILLY'S VOICE
                         ...I have problems with my stomach 
                         and my leg muscles feel very weak.  
                         My gums seem to be shrinking and 
                         they sometimes bleed when I massage 
                         them... They've pulled five of my 
                         teeth...

               Suddenly he starts SHOUTING angrily in TURKISH. The DENTIST 
               screams back at him. AD LIB.

               THE DENTIST still screaming, leans BILLY back in the chair 
               and looks in his mouth.

               BILLY is washing himself in his undershorts at the SINK 
               with ERICH; the hot water is on full blast and billows of 
               vapor fill the small stone room, like a sauna. He pours a 
               pitcher full of hot water over his head; his eyes lingering 
               on:

               THE STONES of the wall with their cracked moldings; some 
               areas are noticeably darker than others - Bell's "wet 
               spots", the alternate escape route.

                         work any more. Because the outside 
                         doesn't seem real any more. It's 
                         not even a fantasy...because there 
                         is no fantasy.

               ERICH uses a coarse washing sponge on BILLY's back.

                         Even masturbation has become boring.  
                         It teaches you, like the rest of 
                         prison life, to seal up your 
                         emotions, and this is the greatest 
                         danger, this is what makes so many 
                         of the men change into something 
                         monstrous...

               EYES of the ARABS peer through the musky vapors at Billy 
               and Erich; they loll about the door curious, lecherous for 
               their bodies.

                                                                    CUT:

                         It is Erich who has taught me how 
                         it is to be conscious, to channel 
                         and direct my energy.  He has 
                         convinced me to stop smoking 
                         hashish, he is the calmest man I 
                         have ever known.  If you don't 
                         control your energy in here if can 
                         blow you apart like with Bell. And 
                         you can't waste it either.  You 
                         have to weigh up every one of your 
                         actions - for and against.  Too 
                         little sex, too much sex either 
                         will throw you off balance...

               ERICH leans forward and kisses a tentative BILLY on the 
               lips.  A gentle kiss. They are standing inside the TOILET 
               STALL; lower themselves down onto the seat. ERICH looks 
               back over his shoulder, guarding their privacy. It is late 
               NIGHT.

                         and the need to express them.  And 
                         he has taught me about love...

               BILLY closes his eyes, softly - and with hesitation - 
               returns ERICH's caress. Their hands probe each other's 
               bodies.

                         to now I have only considered my 
                         own self, never really another...

               ERICH and BILLY do yoga positions together EARLY MORNING 
               fully clothed, in the FIRST FLOOR KOGUS empty space.  ERICH 
               lies on his belly, his back stiffly arched, feet raised.

               BILLY stands silent, balanced lightly on his feet, his 
               palms pressed together beneath his chin, centering, eyes 
               closed.

                         ...and now strange as it seems, 
                         Susan, without having seen you in 
                         so long I feel myself more inside 
                         of you than ever before. I feel 
                         your female mind.  I sense you, 
                         touch you; ...know you; and find 
                         myself falling more and more...  
                         in love with you.

               BILLY rises gracefully onto his toes, stretching his arms 
               out above his head. It is the beginning posture, his body 
               greeting the day.

               BILLY and ERICH sit silently now in lotus position, facing 
               each other, breathing slowly, relaxing minds still, looking 
               into each other's eyes. Billy closes eyes.

               ZIAT comes down, staring at the two of them as he goes 
               into the KITCHEN to prepare early morning tea.

               BILLY's expression changes.

               old wet rag.

                         without him I am calmer than ever...

               BILLY erases out a scraped numeral (54) on the wall and 
               with a chalky piece of rock, inscribes in bold strokes the

               THE GUARD hands the slip to BILLY who is pleasantly 
               surprised.  A visitor.

               PRISON, following a GUARD and turning into:

               THE VISITING ROOM where the little booths with BARS separate 
               prisoner and visitor. Behind the grill is the Consul, 
               STANLEY DAVIS. His face is grim and grey. BILLY senses it 
               immediately.

                         afraid I have some bad news for

                         No... It looks like your going to 
                         have a new court.

                         The Prosecutor objected to your 
                         sentence for possession; he wanted 
                         a smuggling conviction and the 
                         High Court in Ankara reviewed it.

                                     DAVIS
                         We've been notified that they 
                         rejected the sentence...

               Billy's face drains of all expression.

                                     DAVIS
                              (continuing)
                         There were 35 judges on the High 
                         Court. Twenty eight of them voted 
                         for a life sentence.

               BILLY'S EYES. Numb, dazed, surreal.

                                     DAVIS (OFF)
                         The Lower Court in Istanbul will 
                         have to go along with the decision.  
                         The Judge likes you and he'll do 
                         the only thing he can do under the 
                         law.... . He'll reduce the sentence 
                         to thirty years... We're notified... 
                         Billy.

               Suddenly he is GRABBED by his ivy-league striped tie and 
               his face is yanked up to the bars, his glasses falling 
               off.

               BILLY is berserk, his face right up against the bars, 
               GRIPPING Davis tight.

                                     BILLY
                         What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT!  
                         FOR WHAT!

                                     DAVIS
                              (choking)
                         Billy!  Please! 

               Commotion OFF as GUARDS run in, HAMIDOU in the lead.

                                     BILLY
                         FOR WHAT!  FOR WHAT!

               The GUARDS try to pry loose BILLY'S strangling grip ON 
               DAVIS' tie.

                                     BILLY
                         I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT! 

               HAMIDOU takes out a KNIFE and cuts the consul's tie in 
               half.  DAVIS falls backwards.

               BILLY is hauled now. back, still gripping half the tie.  
               He is trembling now.

                                     BILLY
                         I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!

               DAVIS is shaken. He has red bar marks across his face and 
               is absent-mindedly trying to adjust half a tie as he looks 
               at:

               BILLY being hauled out by HAMIDOU, SCREAMING something 
               indistinct.

                                                                    CUT:

               COURTROOM. Same as before.

               BILLY, in the prisoner's dock, addresses the Court; as he 
               speaks, a Turkish TRANSLATOR. drones underneath his voice 
               level:

                                     BILLY
                         ...What is the crime?  And what is 
                         the punishment?  The answer seems 
                         to vary from place to place, and 
                         from time to time. What's legal 
                         today is suddenly illegal tomorrow 
                         cause some society says it's so; 
                         and what's illegal yesterday all 
                         of a sudden gets legal today because 
                         everybody's doing it and you can't 
                         throw everybody in jail. Well I'm 
                         not saying this is right or wrong.  
                         It's just the way things are....

               YESIL the lawyer; DAVIS the consul.

               THE PRESS GIRL from the previous trial in the short skirt.

               BILLY

                                     BILLY
                              (continuous)
                         But I spent the last three and a 
                         half years of my life in your prison 
                         and I think I paid for my error 
                         and if it's your decision today to 
                         sentence me to more years, I... 
                         I...
                              (a break)
                         You know my lawyers told me 'be 
                         cool
                         Billy don't get upset, don't get 
                         angry, if you're good I can maybe 
                         get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal, 
                         this that and the other thing.' 
                         Well that's been going down now 
                         for 35 years...

               YESIL looks over, surprised he is talking like this. Looks 
               at DAVIS.

               BILLY.

                                     BILLY
                              (continuous)
                         And I've been playing it cool and 
                         I've been good and now I'm damn 
                         tired of being good cause you people 
                         gave me the belief that I had 53 
                         days left.  You hung 53 days in 
                         front of my eyes and then you took 
                         those 53 days away, and Mister 
                         Prosecutor!  I just wish you 
                         could...

               PROSECUTOR looks over, through his dark green glasses.

                                     BILLY (OVER)
                         ... stand right here where I'm 
                         standing and feel what that... 
                         ...feels like, cause then you'd 
                         know something you don't know you'd 
                         know what means, Mister Prosecutor 
                         and you'd know the concept of a 
                         society is based on the quality of 
                         its mercy means, of its sense of 
                         fair play, its sense of justice... 
                         but
                              (shrugs and scoffs 
                              at himself)
                         I guess that's just like asking a 
                         bear to shit in a toilet...

               TRANSLATOR stops, looks puzzled.

               BILLY 

                                     BILLY
                              (same self-mocking 
                              tone)
                         For a nation of pigs, it's funny 
                         you don't eat them.  Fuck it, give 
                         me the sentence. Jesus forgave the 
                         bastards, but I can't. I hate you.  
                         Nation. I hate your I hate your 
                         people. And I fuck your sons and 
                         daughters!

               Sits down, disgusted; under his breath:

                                     BILLY
                         ...cause you're all pigs.

               SILENCE in the uncomfortably. courtroom.  PEOPLE looking 
               at each other DAVIS looks down.

               YESIL flips some pages abstractedly.

               TRANSLATOR SCARED:

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Would Your honor like me to 
                         translate?

               THE OLD CHIEF JUDGE, the same one as before Shakes his 
               head.

                                     JUDGE
                         That won't be necessary

               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE JUDGE turns to BILLY in the foreground 
               rises, and unexpectedly crosses his wrists out in front of 
               him.

                                     JUDGE
                              (emotionally)
                         My hands are tied by Ankara!

               Makes the gesture of the hands forcefully, with anger.

                                     TRANSLATOR (OFF)
                         My hands are tied by Ankara!

               BILLY WATCHING,

                                     JUDGE (OFF)
                         I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes...

               JUDGE

                                     JUDGE
                         ... to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar 
                         for a term no less than thirty 
                         years...Getchmis olsun

                                     TRANSLATOR (OFF)
                         "I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes, 
                         to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar for 
                         a term no less than years... 
                         "Getchmis Olsun"

               As he translates, the JUDGE unable to control his emotion 
               exits rapidly, not looking at Billy, followed by the TWO 
               OTHER JUDGES.

                                     TRANSLATOR (OFF)
                         "May it pass quickly."

                                                                    CUT:

               THREE OLD GLEANING WOMEN swathed in black like three fates 
               turn from their sweeping as BILLY is led out COURTROOM 
               NUMBER SIX down a long stone corridor. Dust floats through 
               long slanting shafts of yellowish light, like a striped 
               leotard dream.  BILLY walks, his eyes straight ahead - 
               determined.

                                     SONG OVER (BELL)
                              (old Southern blues 
                              beat, improvised)
                         "Mmmmm... got the blues babe, 
                         Got those old Istanbul blues, 
                         Said Yeah, I got the blues babe 
                         Got those old Istanbul blues...  
                         Thirty years in Turkey, babe, 
                         Ain't got nothing left to lose..."

                                                                    CUT:

               BELL sings it, strumming sloppily but with feeling on his 
               guitar.  BILLY lies, his back up, on his BUNK nearby.  
               MAX, stoned, sits at the base of the bunk. It is NIGHT. 
               The song falters, but MAX now joins in, improvising:

                                     SONG OVER (MAX AND BELL)
                         "Busted at the border 
                         Two keys in my shoes 
                         Said I was busted at the border 
                         with two keys in my shoes 
                         An they gave me thirty years, babe 
                         To learn the old Istanbul blues..."

               SEVERAL TURKS are partying it up down at the other end of 
               the SECOND FLOOR KOGUS, playing a "sas" - Turkish type 
               guitar, counterpointed by a little drum; the music is 
               stridently Turkish, and one of the men does a belly-dance 
               in underpants with two lemons masquerading as breasts under 
               his shirt. The LOUD TWANGING of Bell's GUITAR can be heard 
               OFF, interrupting them. They are annoyed.

               BELL leading MAX into the next stanza:

                                     SONG OVER (MAX AND BELL)
                         "I said Lord now save me 
                          Please save me from this pain"

               BILLY, touched - listening, thinking.

                                     SONG OVER (OVER)
                         "I said Lord come and save me, 
                         Come save me from this pain 
                         Come set me free sweet Jesus..."

                                     TURK (OFF)
                         Hey knock off that shit music...

               TWO TURKS from the party walk up, waving at BELL's guitar,  
               annoyed.

                                     TURK
                         ...We're playing the sas.

                                     BELL
                              (understanding their 
                              Turkish)
                         Omina koyden your sas!
                         (Put your sas in your cunt!)

               THE TWO TURKS tense, the mood changing.

               BELL gets even angrier, puts the guitar aside, ready to 
               spring.

                                     BELL
                         ...And besides that I fuck Allah 
                         and I fuck your Muslim mother too...

               They don't understand but one of them is reaching into his 
               pants for his shiv.

                                     BELL
                         You got that, shit face? Asina...

                                     BILLY (OFF)
                         KNOCK IT OFF!

               ANOTHER ANGLE BILLY is moving fast between the TWO TURKS 
               and BELL. A new authority in his voice, and controlled 
               anger in his face.

                                     BILLY
                              (to Bell)
                         Cut it!  No more fights.

               BELL looks.

                                     BILLY
                         We're getting out of here.

               BELL astonished.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY, with Max's little screwdriver and a metal spoon, 
               digs hard at the cracks around a dark stone in the SINK 
               ROOM, FIRST FLOOR KOGUS.  With him is MAX working on the 
               same stone. They are sweating, shirtless, looking back 
               over their shoulders at:

               BELL guarding the STAIRS.

               BILLY works the stucco out, jiggling with the stone (about 
               a nine inch circumference) using his fingers and 
               screwdriver.  Painful work.

                                     BILLY'S VOICE
                         Dear Susan. It's taken me a long 
                         time to find out that it's got to 
                         stop somewhere. I've learned 
                         painfully not to trust the Turks, 
                         the courts, the lawyers, the Consul, 
                         the United States Government, and 
                         not even my loving parents. There 
                         is only one way out of here.. The 
                         Midnight Express.

               BILLY kicks with his sneakers at the stone, as silently as 
               possible. A LOUD NOISE - crumbling dust, stucco.

               BELL at the stairs freezes, fearful. Then SILENCE.  He 
               Runs over.

               MAX, BELL, BILLY.

                                     MAX
                              (in a whisper)
                         We're undermining the other stones!

               BELL studies it, pointing to the stone above left the one 
               that has been loosened.

                                     BELL
                         We gotta take a chance and do that 
                         one next - 
                              (pointing)
                         Then pull out this one -
                              (pointing to the 
                              one directly left 
                              of the loosened  
                              stone, excited)
                         Just jiggle it, scratch it out, 
                         loose nit up, it's soft real soft!

               BILLY has his head pressed close to the loosened stone.  
               Suddenly:

                                     BILLY
                         It's there!

                                     BELL
                         What?

                                     BILLY
                         Listen!

               ANOTHER ANGLE - all THREE press their ears to the stone.  
               A silence. The faintest whisper of WIND and dripping 'WATER -  
               indicating a shaft of some nature. BELL looks back at BILLY.

                                     BELL
                         I told you, I told you you cock-
                         suckers!  You didn't believe me.

               BILLY smiles. MAX reaches over and grabs Bell's face between 
               his hands, kisses him violently.

                                     MAX
                         Fuck me! You beautiful mother, 
                         you!

                                                                    CUT:

               MAX now on guard at the STAIRS, looks over at:

               BELL AND BILLY - with fresh paste putting the finishing 
               touches on the edges of the stone which has been replaced 
               in its original position. Bell's half naked torso reveals 
               a pair of dice with lucky sevens tattooed on his shoulder.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE REPLACED STONE. On close inspection, it is apparent 
               that the stucco around it doesn't match the other stones 
               one bit, but as we PULL BACK to see ZIAT washing his tea 
               cups in the SINK during the DAY, this irregularity is lost 
               in the greater mosaic of the wall structure. At least ZIAT 
               doesn't notice as:

               BILLY nervously comes into the SINK area, watching him, 
               and calls to him.

                                     BILLY
                              (using Turkish)
                         Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea 
                         will ay!

                                     ZIAT
                              (mutters to himself)
                         Work, work, work, that's all do

                                     BILLY
                         I don't hear you bitch about the 
                         money.

               BILLY followed by ZIAT into the KITCHEN casts a look of 
               relief at:

               BELL and MAX who wait at a table with empty tea cups. 
               

                                                                    CUT:

               A HORDE OF COCKROACHES stream out from a crack in the stone 
               as BILLY and MAX dig, scrape, jiggle the third stone. Both 
               covered with sweat, working with confidence now.

               A DARK EMPTY SHAFT on the other side. Dripping water.  Two 
               stones removed.

               BELL runs over:

                                     BELL
                         Want me to take over?

                                     BILLY
                         You want to split your hernia again?

                                     MAX
                         Get off our tits!

               Bell turns to go. Suddenly a LOUD CRUMBLING NOISE and:

               A FOURTH STONE starts to go - but brakes itself.

               BILLY, MAX, BELL all framed in a posture of fear -- not 
               daring to move.

               SECOND STORY KOGUS remains silent.

               BELL looks up the STAIRS, tiptoes back, indicating they 
               are clear.

               MAX AND BILLY. All THREE of them look:

               THE THREE A HALF STONE SPACE. Easily big enough for them 
               to squeeze through. BILLY shines a candle in the shaft, 
               OFF.

               THE THREE look at each other. The same thought. Eager eyes.  
               The TRAIN WHISTLES by in the night, OFF.

                                     BELL
                              (sudden)
                         Let's go!

               BILLY looks at his watch, hates to do it. Shakes his head.

                                     BILLY
                         No. No time. Put 'em back.

               MAX groans to himself.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY tense and restless at his BUNK TWILIGHT. A loud RADIO 
               OFF - Turkish News.

                                     BILLY
                         We go early. Any fuck-ups we should 
                         be back here and have the stones 
                         in by dawn.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - MAX, BELL, AND BILLY. A pause.

                                     BILLY
                         You got your stuff?

                                     MAX
                         Yeah.

                                     BELL
                              (persistent)
                         Haps, railroad, bus timetables?

                                     MAX
                              (business-like)
                         Everything.

                                     BILLY
                         Okay.
                              (looks around the 
                              group)
                         Let's do it.

               He extends his hands and the other two cross in a six-handed 
               shake.

                                                                    CUT:

               MAX signals down the STAIRS - "all clear".

               BILLY going through the HOLE in the STONES that NIGHT into:

               A DARK SHAFT spookily leading downwards. He lights a thick 
               CANDLE tied horizontally across his sneakers so as to give 
               him his light source where his footholds are.  His P.V.O:

               PART DUMBWAITER SHAFT, PART WATER WELL from a previous 
               century A series of corrugated mossy old footholds and 
               iron spikes lead down at irregular intervals.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY, MAX AND BELL, each with their own foot candle, are 
               spaced along the shaft easing downwards. BILLY looks up at 
               MAX about ten feet above.

                                     BILLY
                         Okay?

                                     MAX
                         Yeah! 

                                     BILLY
                         Jimmy?

                                     BELL
                              (struggling.)
                         What?

                                     BILLY
                         How's your hernia?

                                     BELL
                         Don't make me laugh.

               BILLY in a sweat, slips. A tense moment - then he catches 
               himself.  OFF - the TRAIN WHISTLE can be heard, echoing 
               into the shaft.Mixed suddenly with LOUD TALKING OFF. Arguing 
               in Turkish.  BILLY freezes, signals upwards with a sharp 
               hiss of breath.

                                     VOICE #1 (OFF)
                         What do you mean, you forgot, he'll 
                         have my ass!

                                     VOICE #2 (OFF)
                         Well I can't do two things at once, 
                         you were supposed to be here at 
                         nine o'clock!

               BILLY identifying the relative location of the voices, 
               eases downwards, coming to a GRILL, looks in at:

               A BASEMENT ROOM with FURNACE. TWO TURKISH GUARDS throw the 
               prison rubbish in the furnace, still arguing, AD LIB.

               BILLY signals upwards.

               REVERSE ANGLE, from inside the basement, of BILLY slipping 
               past the grill, his face sharply illuminated by the flame 
               of the furnace.

               Off the walls around the grill we can see the GIANT 
               SILHOUETTES of the two guards still arguing.

               BILLY comes to the base of the shaft. A puddle of scummy 
               water.  Unstraps the candle. A current of WIND He peers 
               around.

               P.O.V. - A WINDING NARROW CATACOMB, WITH BEEHIVE BURIAL 
               PLACES ON BOTH SIDES.

               BILLY, sniffing the stench, unrolls a ball of THREAD ties 
               it to a marker and heads in.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY, BELL and MAX are in the catacomb. A scratchy hideous 
               sound and:

               BATS fly out squealing from the ceiling.

               THE BOYS hit the ground as BATWINGS flap over them, 
               colliding against each other, knocking off walls, 
               SCREECHING, then diminishing in sound. Fewer and fewer. 
               Then gone.

                                     MAX
                              (looking up, scared)
                         Jesus!

               BILLY looking up. 

                                     BILLY
                         Anybody bitten?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     BELL
                         Nah, just covered with batshit!

                              knees)
                         They went out over there: must be 
                         some kind of exit.

               Heads in that direction.

                                                                    CUT:

               A HUGE SPIDER scatters off, as BILLY's CANDLE illuminates:

               ANOTHER ENDLESS WALKWAY.  BILLY comes to a stop - 
               frustrated.

                                     BILLY
                         Let's go back the other way.

               INTERSECTION Two walkways.  BELL leads in, unwinding the 
               thread, stops.

                                     BELL
                              (desperate)
                         The fuck are we?

               BILLY comes into view, equally frustrated.

                                     BILLY
                         What time is it?

                         Two thirty.

               ANOTHER MAZE of walkways. The three stop exhausted, faces 
               blackened.  BILLY, in utter rage and frustration starts 
               kicking the wall.

                                     BILLY
                         Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

                              ground)
                         It's a dead end. The Turks musta' 
                         sealed it up.

                                     BELL
                         What the fuck we gonna do?

               SILENCE as the three pathetic escapees ponder their fate.

               BILLY, getting a grip on himself, thinking.

                                     BILLY
                         We go back.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     MAX
                         What?  You gotta be joking.

                                     BILLY
                              (resolute)
                         We go back, seal it up again, and 
                         come in tomorrow night - every 
                         night 'till we get out of here.  
                         There's gotta be a way. Those bats 
                         got out someplace.
                              (rises)
                         Now let's go.  Doubletime!

               Takes the THREAD and starts to follow it back.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE SHAFT. BILLY leads the climbers UP.

               MAX reaches a new foothold, stops, getting his breath.  
               Looks down at BELL heavy breathing OFF.  Urging him on.

                                     MAX
                         You gotta have a lot of balls for 
                         this 
                         

               BELL, suffering, can't help but grin.

                                     BELL
                              (murmurs)
                         Count me out.
                              (to himself, shaking 
                              his head)
                         Who ever heard of anybody sneaking 
                         back into a fucking jail?

               MAX overhearing it.

                                     MAX
                         Yeah, what if got caught?

               BELL starts to giggle.

                                     BILLY (OFF)
                              (up the shaft)
                         Hey Max, don't make the dummy laugh.

               MAX laughing, shaking his head.

                                     MAX
                              (between giggles)
                         Who's laughing?  I mean I find 
                         this terribly depressing... Can 
                         you see old Hamidou's face when he 
                         tries to figure this one out?

               BILLY can't go on, starts to giggle at the thought.

                                     BILLY
                              (between giggles)
                         We'll tell him we were checking 
                         out our escape route.  We wanted 
                         to be completely sure before we 
                         tried it.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - the THREE of them, spaced along the shaft, 
               are all giggling hysterically. Echoing. HOLD ON them.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY comes through the HOLE in the stones in the SINK 
               AREA.  It is still NIGHT.  He looks around - silence. MAX 
               follows through the hole.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY and MAX work fractically to seal up the STONES.

               BELL, exhausted, is at the STAIRS guarding. Distant early 
               morning SOUNDS of prison waking up.  We feel they will be 
               spotted this time, but:

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY slumps into his BUNK as the first rays of LIGHT come 
               up in the sky and the CHANT from the Mosque commences.  He 
               immediately sinks into sleep.

               CLOSE on OLD TEA LEAVES being washed in the SINK.  A MILKY 
               WHITE EYE follows into view.  ZIAT is preparing his early 
               morning tea, his good eye now moving to something beyond 
               the tea leaves. Curious, he straightens, throwing the 
               withered bunch of leaves the sink.

               ZIAT approaches the irregular stucco paste around the 
               REPLACED STONES; runs his fingers along the ridges, noticing 
               the paste is fresh.

               BILLY snoring from fatigue.  BELL wakes him quickly.

                                     BELL
                         Billy, wake up!  They found it!

               OFF there is a lot of SHOUTING downstairs.

                                     BILLY
                         Who?

                                     BELL
                         Ziat! 

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY standing in a group of PRISONERS with BELL and MAX. 
               He has a look of total despair on his face, as he watches.  

               THE SINK.  PRISONERS are everywhere jabbering excitedly 
               among themselves.  ZIAT is conferring with HAMIDOU as GUARDS 
               rip out the last stone, revealing the HOLE leading to the 
               SHAFT.

               BILLY's gaze shifts to ZIAT fixing all his hatred on him.

               ZIAT grinning, moves away, and his falaka stick cocked 
               like a sergeant major - moves among the prisoners.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         Shut up! 

               They all fall immediately silent.  HAMIDOU continues his 
               walk among them, bypassing:

               MAX who shifts his gaze onto:

               BILLY.  HAMIDOU approaches, his eyes moving over BILLY 
               with contempt, and shifting him aside with the stick. To 
               him Billy is the same passive prisoner as before. He moves 
               on, shifting OTHERS aside and then stops at:

               BELL.  HAMIDOU swings his stick up slowly and taps him 
               lightly on the chest. BELL realizes and is afraid.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         No do!  No do!  I tell you I see 
                         you again.. Finish!

               He punctuates this last with a theatrical tap on the chest 
               and he gestures to the GUARDS.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         Take him!

               BELL, already broken by bad beatings, shivers.

                                     BELL.
                         No!  Oh no!  No...

               GUARDS grab him, hurry him out the Kogus behind HAMIDOU

               BILLY holds himself rigid, trying not to break. Bell's 
               PROTESTS continue OFF.

               MAX unable to contain his anger, strides right up to ZIAT, 
               collars him, livid.

                                     MAX
                         You bastard! This time I'm gonna 
                         kick your fucking brains all over 
                         this kitchen!

                                     ZIAT
                              (calm)
                         Fine.  Good.  Man to man.  We fight 
                         now.  And when finish I bring 
                         Hamidou and he kick you fuckinq 
                         ass.

               MAX is about to swing when BILLY grabs him.

                                     BILLY
                         Max! Cool it!
                              (looking at Ziat 
                              calmly)
                         Ziat's just doing his job.

               ZIAT Glances from BILLY back to MAX fixing on him as BILLY 
               walks him away.

                                                                    CUT:

               MAX is at his BUNK that NIGHT; puts away the hypodermic 
               needle, stoned and speeding at the same time, smoking a 
               cigarette.  BILLY inwardly tense, sits with his head in 
               his hands.

                                     MAX
                         Bell's gonna talk. They got to 
                         find out. Man, we gotta out.

               Tears have formed in his eyes.

                                     MAX
                         Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making 
                         me blind. Hey Billy!

                                     BILLY
                              (sympathetic)
                         Yeah.

                                     MAX
                         I got some acid man.  Maybe we can 
                         drop some on the guards huh? In 
                         their tea or something.

               BILLY looks away, not even considering. But MAX is caught 
               up in the notion.

                                     MAX
                         Yeah I got it all worked out.  
                         Billy, listen to me.
                              (looks at Billy, 
                              his eyes glazed)
                         That old guard likes you, You drop 
                         some acid on him.  When he's Seeing 
                         rainbows yer know. walk out - 
                         tonight.

                                     BILLY
                         Then we're outside the kogus.  
                         Then what?

                                     MAX
                         What? 

                                     BILLY
                         After we're outside the kogus?

                                     MAX
                         Oh we... we...

                                     BILLY
                         Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...

               MAX clumsily brushes the burning ash off his shirt where 
               it's made a hole.

                                     MAX
                         Oh shit!  Oh Christ! 

               His eyes cloud with tears.  He sits down, head between his 
               hands.

                                     MAX
                         There just comes a time you know...  
                         you know you're never going to git 
                         it on.

               Suddenly shifts mood again, stands, pulling out a SHIV, 
               resolute, eyes brightening.

                                     MAX
                         That's what I'm gonna do.
                              (giggles)

               BILLY looks up wondering.

                                     BILLY
                         What?

                                     MAX
                              (crazily)
                         Cut his fucking throat.

                                     BILLY
                         Whose?

                                     MAX
                         ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh!  
                         What do I got to lose. And I'd 
                         really enjoy it. 

               Lurches against the bunk.

                                     BILLY
                         Max, sit down. You're in no shape 
                         to kill anybody.

                                     MAX
                         I want to cut his throat.

                                     BILLY
                         It's already been cut.

                                     MAX
                         Then I'll cut his balls off.

               BILLY smiles, shakes his head, then:

                                     BILLY
                         If you really wanted to hurt Ziat
                              (pause)

               MAX slumps back down on the bunk, suddenly tired of killing.

                                     BILLY
                              (reflective)
                         ...His money - steal that, you 
                         steal his blood... Could you see 
                         his face when everything he worked 
                         so hard to get got snatched?
                              (plays with the 
                              thought idly, then 
                              shrugs)
                         If we knew where he hid it.
                              (waves it away)
                         Anyway, steal from him they'd pick 
                         up the whole prison and shake it

                              (a vague grin)
                         I know where it is.

               BILLY glances at him, not sure whether he heard.

                                     BILLY
                         His money?

               MAX gives him a goofy nod - and a grin. Imitating Robert 
               Newton as Long John Silver.

                                     MAX
                         'Dem dat hides can finds says I'...

                              him)
                         Yeah? Where?

               MAX, distracted, let's his attention wander back.  Inaudible 
               his head bobbing now.

               BILLY surprised, then reflective.

               THE BACK OF THE RADIO is unscrewed; the cover pulled off.

               MOVE TO ZIAT.  The look is as Billy expected. Horror, shock, 
               anger, fear.  ZIAT SCREAMS hysterically like old Greek 
               widow and:

               BEATING HIS CHEST and tearing at his hair, ZIAT runs out 
               of the KOGUS wailing, moaning.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE SECOND STORY KOGUS is being" controlled" by the GUARDS.  
               WIDE ANGLE reveals a circus of clockwork destruction as 
               the GUARDS, making abundant NOISE, systematically rip up 
               each bunk, locker, mattress, picture, book, etc., their 
               faces flushed with this opportunity for orgy.

                                                                    CUT:

               HAMIDOU breaks apart a with his bare hands.

               ZIAT is stripping MAX's possessions, sure he will find it 
               here.

               ZIAT leaning in CLOSE, OVER THE STOVE in the KITCHEN, framed 
               by GUARDS. It is the same crouched posture he always uses 
               to work the stove but now his eyes show complete despair 
               as he sees:

               A THOUSAND SHREDS OF PAPER MONEY floating in his pots amid 
               his withered tea bags. From ashes to ashes and dust to 
               dust.

               ZIAT folds his head into his hands, sobbing then wailing 
               very human, very sad.

                                                                    CUT:

                         I'll drink to that.
                              (toasting with the 
                              tea)

               Just as:

               ZIAT enters the kitchen; he eyes Max with hatred, sits at 
               the other TABLE and orders tea. Surprisingly, he is wearing 
               a suit and clean shirt-unlike his usual grimy appearance.

               BILLY, looking shaken, enters the kitchen, glances at ZIAT 
               sits with MAX.

                                     BILLY
                         Just got some news on Bell.

                         What?

               BILLY AND MAX

                                     BILLY
                         Why the suit?

                                     MAX
                         Maybe he's changing jobs.

               HAMIDOU and a DOZEN GUARDS spreading through the KOGUS, 
               assembling everybody with shouts of "SAYIM!"

                                                                    CUT:

               THE PRISONERS are lined up in ranks in the FIRST FLOOR 
               KOGUS.

               BILLY glancing at MAX next to him, wondering why.

               HAMIDOU goes down the line, his FLUNKIES searching each 
               man.

               A GUARD reaches into ZIAT'S pocket and comes out with a 
               matchbox. Yells to HAMIDOU who comes over.

                                     HAMIDOU
                              (opening the matchbox)
                         Nebu?

               MATCHBOX Containing a small amount of HASHISH.

               HAMIDOU reaches over and pulls ZIAT out of the 'line 
               roughly.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         Nebu? 

               Starts to slap him around.

               BILLY glancing at MAX.

                                     MAX
                              (worried)
                         What's going on?  Maybe Ziat can't 
                         pay off; Hamidou's taking it out 
                         in trade.

               HAMIDOU smashes ZIAT again, but pulls the punch.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         Where did you get this hash?

               Raises his arm again.

                                     ZIAT
                              (cowering, pretending 
                              fear)

               Point at: 

               MAX who stiffens, eyes like cracked eggs.

                                     MAX
                              (under his breath)
                         You got to be kidding.

               HAMIDOU peers at MAX, advances.

                                     HAMIDOU

                         I know your face. Where did you 
                         get the hash?

               into a bunk.

               BILLY, fists clenched, yells a string of Turkish curse 
               words at him:

                                     BILLY

               Lunges.

               ZIAT is bulky, throws the smaller BILLY off and scrambles 
               past a bunk.

               BILLY is up and after him. Jumps back as a SHIV cuts the 
               air in front of him. His side is cut.

               ZIAT holding the shiv, feints, cursing BILLY in Turkish.

               BILLY skips back, takes a MATTRESS off the bed and runs it 
               right into KNOCKING HIM AND THE WHOLE BUNK OVER.

               THE TWO scramble around, BILLY tackling him into another 
               BUNK which also goes over. Chairs break.

               ZIAT butts his head into BILLY'S jaw.

               BILLY staggers back from the blow and ZIAT jumps him, BITING 
               into his ear.

               ZIAT, getting a better hold, now BITES into BILLY'S NOSE.

               BILLY slams ZIAT in the nose hard with the palm of his 
               hand.  ZIAT relinquishes his hold, grabbing at his broken 
               bleeding nose.

               BILLY beats him around the head but though the blood now 
               flows and teeth are broken, is like a clumsy bear, hard to 
               kill.

               ZIAT scrambles away on his knees under another BUNK now 
               screaming as loud as he can.

                                     ZIAT
                         HELP ME!  GUARDS!  HELP ME!

               SEVERAL PRISONERS watching from further down the SECOND 
               STORY Kogus now move in sync, turning on their RADIOS loud 
               as possible, drowning out the cries for help, others 
               watching the stairs.

               BILLY takes the BUNK and throws it over, revealing ZIAT 
               cowering in pure terror. He grabs ZIAT by the hair, hauls 
               him up and

               LAUNCHES HIS KNEE into HIS FACE.

               ZIAT thuds onto the floor.

               BILLY stomps him in the gut hard.

               ZIAT screams unnaturally shrill.

               BILLY, driven by supernatural anger, now jumps on him and 
               CLAMPS HIS MOUTH right on ZIAT'S open SCREAM.

               A STRUGGLING KISS ensues.

               BILLY pulls back, his mouth filled with blood, spitting 
               out.

               AN UNIDENTIFIED PIECE OF FLESH which Bits the ground with 
               an odd slow motion grace.

               ZIAT - CLOSE in terror; throat cords rippling; eyes bulging 
               with disbelief, body quivering, mouth open and screaming, 
               but it is a SILENT SCREAM and the mouth is a dark hole 
               filled with blood and without a TONGUE.

               BILLY, without a moment's mercy, crashes his fist into 
               ZIAT'S face.

               ZIAT his strength now broken, collapses on his back.

               BILLY crashes his fist again into the hated face. He is 
               GRABBED now by a GUARD, but:

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY shakes the GUARD OFF, then as ANOTHER 
               GUARD runs up, BILLY SLAMS him aside and, obsessed, lunges 
               back down on ZIAT and

               BOTH HANDS CLAMPED TOGETHER high in the air delivers a 
               final blow to ZIAT'S face. The bones shatter. Pause. His 
               ogre unconscious beneath him, BILLY, now in SLOW MOTION, 
               EXTENDS HIS ARMS IN THE AIR - in the fighter's victory 
               gesture, and his eyes glow with the fever in them, and 
               with his mouth and face bloodied, he looks like a savage. 
               No longer Billy Hayes.

                                                              SHARP CUT:

               BILLY bound in a thick leather belt (a kiyis) which screws 
               tightly around the waist and cinches the hands together, 
               is being HAULED in continuing SLOW MOTION through a huge 
               DOOR somewhere in one of the cavernous corridors of the 
               prison.The door is approximately NINE FEET by SIX FEET, 
               strong and wooden with a circular iron handle which one of 
               the GUARDS now pulls open; a GLIMPSE of darkness within.

               THE DOOR CLOSES. SUPERIMPOSE:

                     SECTION 13 - ASYLUM FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE

                                     A YEAR LATER 

               MAX, barely recognizable in a torn sheet and with a 
               blackened face, comes rushing into a crowded ROOM, screaming 
               louder than any other inmate. marks on his face, He is 
               enraged, blood dripping from scratch ATTENDANTS in white 
               smocks chase him over the beds. Max is yelling in Turkish.

                                     MAX
                         Please, will you listen to me?  
                         Will someone please listen to me?  
                         JUST LISTEN To ME!

                                     ATTENDANTS
                         Hamidou! Get Hamidou! Get the 
                         Kiyisl!

               The ATTENDANTS wrestle with him, but he throws them off, 
               tearing around the room mindlessly. In the process we see 
               that not much attention is paid him because everybody else 
               is crazy!  There are 50 other LUNATICS yelling at each 
               other in fights over sheets, blankets, beds, cigarettes, 
               jumping: screaming, pushing, shoving; some babbling to 
               themselves, rocking, crying, chanting, singing.  Several 
               of them (the craziest) are stark naked. some, wrapped in 
               torn blackened sheets, patrol the room like quick ferrets, 
               sharp eyes open for anything they can steal. Others move 
               in meaningless, blank-eyed silence. The walls are filthy 
               black and join the ceilings in arches rather than angles, 
               giving the look of an old dungeon. Fifty beds are lined up 
               right next to each other so that you walk right into your 
               bed.  A constant nerve-racking NOISE. 
                
               HAMIDOU bursts into the ROOM, the angry look in his eyes 
               spelling real trouble for Max. MOVE with him as he sweep 
               sin on MAX and picks him up with one move and SMASHES HIM 
               against the wall. Max hardly notices.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the leather kiyis from an 
               ATTENDANT, moves in on MAX and starts clamping it around 
               him.

               AN ATTENDANT walks through the room with an apron containing 
               several large pockets bulging with red, green, blue, white 
               PILLS, which he distributes by the handful. 
               

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (crying out)
                         Hop! Hop!  Hop!  Full moon.  Hop!  
                         Hop!  Hop!

               THE LUNATICS gobble them up as if they were candy. In some 
               of the clustered areas, nine lunatics occupy as little as 
               three beds.

               MAX is tightly bound now by HAMIDOU, but his body arches 
               against the bindings, his neck straining, his teeth snapping 
               at the air.  HAMIDOU grabs him with one hand by the leather 
               waist, hauls him high up in the air and 
                
               THROWS MAX half-ways across the room, MAX smashing heavily 
               against some beds, continuing to SCREAM OFF as:

               THE ATTENDANT with the pills-now bypasses BILLY on one of 
               the beds.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Hop!  Hop!  Full Moon - take your 
                         pills!

               BILLY gobbles them up. He has changed. Lines in his face.

               No smile, no sense of humor; a brooding silence about him, 
               a straight ahead look. He pays no attention to MAX off; he 
               is in grubby white pyjamas and shower sandals. Rolls back 
               onto hi& bed with its filthy torn sheet, totally ignoring 
               the surrounding commotion, and

               ANOTHER ANGLE - turning onto his shoulder, BILLY suddenly 
               finds himself face to face with a dark saddened visage. 
               The MAN is very young and stark naked but for an old black 
               rag wrapped around his head and clutched under his chin. 
               His eyes are yellow, the voice pleading.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Cigare?
                              (pause, same tone, 
                              holds out his palm)
                         Cigare? Cigare?

               BILLY shakes his head sharply --too sharply --and barks, 
               irritable.

                                     BILLY
                         Go away! 

               Turns on his other shoulder, trying to sleep.

                                     YOUNG MAN (OFF)
                         Cigare? Cigare?

               YOUNG MAN in a surprisingly meek tone.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         S'il Vous plait, Monsieur? S'il 
                         vous plait?

               BILLY, really aggravated now, springs up from the bed, and 
               in the quirky way the mad and the eccentric adopt walks 
               determinedly away from the young man, looking back to shake 
               his head bizarrely at him one more time.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               BILLY walking down the aisle bypasses MAX int he kiyis, 
               rolling on the floor, still screaming in Turkish.

                                     MAX
                         Will you listen to me? PLEASE LISTEN 
                         TO ME!  

               Several LUNATICS are gathered around tormenting him, one 
               of them yanking on his penis as if it were made of rubber; 
               another is playing with his ass. A third one, also in a 
               leather kiyis, is leaning over MAX jabbering and drooling 
               into his face.

               MAX, more enraged by this than the other bodily offences, 
               lunges up sharply and bites the man's FACE. SCREAMS, etc.

               BILLY, paying no attention except for a brief disinterested 
               glance, keeps going into:

               A SECOND ROOM.  MORE  LUNATICS. A screaming OLD MAN is 
               chasing after another OLD MAN who has stolen his tespe 
               beads, waving them back at the first old man who howls 
               with rage, frantic to have his beads back. The second old 
               man throws the beads to a THIRD OLD MAN who hops across 
               the beds with the FIRST OLD MAN chasing him. BILLY 
               intersects.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (pleading)
                         Allah!  Allah!  Yok!  Yok!  Yok!  
                         Brack!

                
               A LITTLE NERVOUS MAN stares into a broken pocket mirror 
               fingering the large round carbuncle under his eye, trying 
               to rub it away with little grimaces and flurries of nervous 
               motion.

               TWO ATTENDANTS in smocks indifferently finish eating on a 
               newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out 
               the paper.

               CHICKEN BONES, ORANGE PEELS hitting the floor. A flurry of 
               movement, as the LUNATICS scuffle like rats over the left-
               overs. AD LIB curses, yells.

               AN OLD MAN obscenely gestures to BILLY from his bed.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Hey American.  Fik!  Fick!  Come.  
                         Fik!  Fik!

               His blackened teeth leer.

               BILLY, seemingly immune to all of this in some private 
               island of his own madness, walks in his determined way 
               past a PARTITION to:

               A CIRCULAR STONE STAIRCASE leading downwards, the stones 
               damp, dark, slippery. BILLY continues with the same straight-
               ahead determination to:

               A LONER LEVEL. at last BILLY's expression changes to almost 
               childish relief, for here at last is the refuge he seeks 
               the relative comfort and silence of THE WHEEL.  

               It is a grim, squat PILLAR dominating the room and bearing 
               the weight of the ceiling. And around it some SIXTY LUNATICS 
               trudge slowly, near silently, in counter-clockwise flow. 
               It is a hypnotic shuffle and BILLY blends right in, sliding 
               easily into the sluggish, mindless river, his eyes hanging 
               loosely on the floor, watching:

               THE SOOTHING RHYTHM OF FEET shuffling at a comforting pace.  
               These are the spokes of the wheel.

                                                                    CUT:

               TWO TINY BARE LIGHT-BULBS give faint, eerie illumination 
               to the chamber. One one side, a pot-bellied stove flickers, 
               etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange 
               glow.

               SOME LUNATICS, not walking, hover around the stove.  OTHERS 
               are jammed onto a low L-shaped wooden platform that runs 
               the length of two walls. of these men are naked, covered 
               with open running sores over their knees, elbows, buttocks.  
               But they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd. They 
               are the lowest order of madmen. They have no minds left. 
               They are the damned.

               BILLY walks among them, expressionless. A tall, thin 
               cadaverous TURK with a grizzled beard now shuffles up 
               alongside BILLY, looks at him, walks with him. is about 
               fifty, his pyjamas relatively clean, looking more sane 
               than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his 
               wet hair is matted down on his head, and big clumps of it 
               have been pulled out. He speaks with a cultured English 
               accent.

                                     AHMET
                         You're an American?

               BILLY is interrupted but keeps his eyes on the ground.  
               AHMET doesn't wait for an answer.

                                     AHMET
                         Ah yes, America!  My name is Ahmet.  
                         I studied philosophy at Harvard 
                         for many many years. But actually 
                         Oxford is my real Alma  Mata -   
                         I've also studied in Vienna. Now I 
                         study here.

               BILLY doesn't notice, shuffles along.

                                     AHMET
                         ...They put me here. They say I 
                         raped a little boy. I have been 
                         here very long time. They will 
                         never let me go.

               BILLY pays no attention, keeps shuffling on.  Glances at 
               him, smiles.

                                     AHMET
                         They won't let YOU go either.

               The smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep 
               inside Billy, because Billy glances briefly at this lunatic 
               who is smiling. Billy looks back at his feet.

                                     AHMET
                         No, they'll never let you go.  
                         They tell you they let you go but 
                         you stay. You never go from here.

               BILLY plods on. grins and tries to explain the situation 
               like a father lecturing a child.

                                     AHMET
                         You see we all come from a factory. 
                         Sometimes the factory makes bad 
                         machines that don't work. They put 
                         them here. The bad machines don't 
                         know they're bad machines, but the 
                         people at the factory know. They 
                         know one of the machines that 
                         doesn't work...

               They walk on.  Ahmet's expression changes.

                                     AHMET
                              (polite)
                         I think we have spoken enough for 
                         today.  I say good night to you.

               He wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we 
               FOLLOW him out of the circle. He drops to his hands and 
               knees and with a sense of dignity, crawls into the filthy 
               blackness under the L-shaped wooden platform, disappearing 
               like a cockroach.

               BILLY plods on.

                                                                    CUT:

               AN OLD WHITE-BEARDED MADMAN the Hoja, grandiose in his 
               rags, leads MUSLIM PRAYER in the first ROOM. Some of his 
               followers have prayer mats, others a scrap of sheet or 
               newspaper; their tones discordant, still pushing and shoving 
               at each other during the prayer.

               TWO SPASTICS can't follow the routine of kneeling and 
               bending; they tangle up absurdly and fall to the floor in 
               a ball of arms and legs.

               A FALAKA STICK pokes BILLY wake SOUND of the CHANTING fills 
               room. It is evidently impossible to distinguish night from 
               day because there are no windows.

               ATTENDANTS poke the LUNATICS awake with their "clubs.

                                     ATTENDANTS
                         Head count!  Head count! 

                                                                    CUT:

               A MASS OF LUNATICS in the ROOM all at once.  Attendants 
               take a redundant and comic head count. The place sounds 
               like a "yadi yadi room" the noise fearsome.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         Sixty two, sixty three, sixty 
                         four....

                                     ATTENDANT #2
                         Seventy four, seventy five, seventy 
                         six.. .get back there, you! . . . 
                         seventy five, seventy six....)

               ATTENDANTS poke around underneath a bed and pull out a 
               very old trembling VEGETABLE.

               OTHER ATTENDANTS wrap an old DEAD LUNATIC with no teeth 
               and foam on his open lips into a dirty sheet and haul him 
               away.

               BILLY amid the LUNATICS.  We MOVE closer and closer to 
               him, the head COUNT regressing. The room has become a 
               torture cell - the NOISE LOUDER, LOUDER, closing in on 
               Billy.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY is led down a CORRIDOR by HAMIDOU into:

               A VISITING room - Cabins are lined up like narrow wooden 
               phone booths.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         Kabin on-yedi

               BILLY plods without interest to the specified cabin, closes 
               the door, sits in the chair. No one is there. He waits -
               indifferent to any sense of time. Dirty two glass panes 
               separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between the 
               panes.  An erratic microphone is the method of 
               communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the 
               voice.

               HAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door, looks 
               in unseen as:

               TEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in 
               holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for 
               her to react, and then her face shows the shock.

               BILLY stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he 
               remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is 
               a shock to him as well. Reality, the outside world all at 
               once. His mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp 
               it.

                                     SUSAN (OFF)
                         Oh my God...!

               SUSAN 

                                     SUSAN
                         Billy, what have they done to 
                         you...my God!

               The MICROPHONE makes her voice jarring, gagged. She looks 
               silently.  No sobbing, no big sad looks. Just shock.  Shock 
               of recognition, shock of time gone by.

               BILLY looking at her, his eyes moving down to:

               BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN, her neck, her breasts straining 
               against the thin shirt.

               SUSAN fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow and 
               distinct; not sure she is communicating.

                                     SUSAN
                         ...Billy, your family is fine.  
                         Senator Buckley just made a special 
                         plea on your behalf in the Senate.  
                         Newsday has written several big 
                         articles about you.  They've called 
                         you a pawn in the poppy game between 
                         Nixon and the Turks. The letters 
                         are coming in, Billy. People 
                         care.... 
                          
                         

               Stops, shakes her head. It sounds all wrong in this context.

               BILLY is still staring at her breasts. He hasn't seen a 
               woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes 
               into his eyes He moves suddenly pressing up against the 
               glass, rabid.  And in Turkish:

                                     BILLY
                              (in Turkish)
                         Take it off. Take it off!
                              (then remembering 
                              the English)
                         Take it off. Take it off!

               His voice is savage, demanding.

               SUSAN understands, startled. Looks around.

                                     SUSAN
                         Billy - you'll just make yourself 
                         crazy.

               BILLY

                                     BILLY
                         Take it off! Take it off!
                              (suddenly in a very 
                              soft voice)
                         ...S'il vous plait?...

               A strange look in his eye.

               SUSAN slowly, scared, begins to unbutton her shirt.

               HAMIDOU looks on silently, does nothing.

               BILLY follows every movement with wild-eyed lust.

               SUSAN leans up close to the window.  With both hands on 
               the front of her blouse, she slowly draws it apart.

               BILLY going wild! Against the window. His hand down in his 
               pyjamas.

               HER BREASTS spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a 
               deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. They hang full and 
               loose.  FULL SCREEN

               BILLY'S EYES - FULL SCREEN.

               BILLY beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly.

               SUSAN is shattered, scared of Billy's sanity.

                                     SUSAN
                         Oh Billy, Billy, I wish I could 
                         make it better for you. Please 
                         don't...  don't...

               Tears. Fear.

               BILLY tightens dramatically and comes right in his pants, 
               slumps against the window.

               SUSAN realizes he has come, surprised.

               BILLY looks at her. Furtive, animal shame. And suddenly he 
               starts to cry. A flood of feelings locked up too long come 
               pouring out. He murmurs some words, Turkish SOUNDS 
               sputtering out in his throat, then:

                                     BILLY
                         S.... Susan?

               Softly, working his mouth finding it hard to speak.

               SUSAN yearning. Tears sprinkling her eyes.

                                     SUSAN
                         Yes, Billy?

               BILLY straining, not out of physical weakness but an 
               emotional one. Sputters, eyes closed.

                                     BILLY
                         ...I love you....

               It sounds pathetic, lost.

               SUSAN is worked up to the limit, tries to hug him through 
               the window.

                                     SUSAN
                         Oh Billy... Billy!  Don't give up.  
                         Please don't give up. You'll get 
                         out. I know you will!

               Remembers something. Grabs the PHOTO ALBUM with all her 
               strength, holding it up for him to see through the 
               glass.Then remembering herself, looks around the room to 
               make sure they're alone and in a contained voice:

                                     SUSAN
                         Billy, your father gave me this 
                         for you.  There's pictures of your 
                         Mom and Dad...Rob...Peg...

               BILLY looks at it listlessly.

               HIS P.V.O - SUSAN holding the album open to PICTURES of 
               his MOTHER and FATHER in front of the house, ROB on a 
               bicycle, PEG in her cheer-leading outfit.

                                     SUSAN
                         And there's pictures in the back 
                         of your old Mr. Franklin.  Remember 
                         him... From the bank?

               A certain tone slips into her voice.

                                     SUSAN
                         He's over in Greece now. He bought 
                         a ticket.

               BILLY looks from the album to Susan. Possibly there is a 
               gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint. 
               An Attendant BANGS on Susan's door, OFF.

                                     VOICE
                         Visiting is over.

               SUSAN quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden 
               weapon.

                                     SUSAN
                         I'll give it to them for you.

               She buttons her blouse but her eyes are worried, on Billy.

                                     SUSAN
                         You were right Billy don't count 
                         on them, you hear, don't count on 
                         anybody but yourself! 
                         

               The ATTENDANT now swings open her door, annoyed.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Let's go!

               Susan stands, about to go, then suddenly leans up close to 
               the bars, hard and practical.

                                     SUSAN
                              (quickly)
                         If you stay you'll die Billy!  Get 
                         out of here. Get to Greece, you 
                         hear me?...Billy?

               Pause. Silence. She closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't 
               think she has reached him. She turns to go, resigned.

               BILLY looking at her. Behind him HAMIDOU opens the door.  
               A calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with Billy 
               towards

               A BRIEF GLIMPSE of SUSAN looking back, the album under her 
               arm. The door closes.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY, with the same deadened expression as before, comes 
               down the STAIRS towards THE WHEEL. It is early morning and 
               the walkers haven't started yet. Billy looks at the Pillar 
               a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes. Then he 
               starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the 
               normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               BILLY, on the inner track, passes TWO LUNATICS who are 
               walking counter-clockwise. They glare at him, motion for 
               him to turn around. Billy just keeps walking.

               BILLY intersects several more LUNATICS going counter-
               clockwise They motion for him to turn.

                                     LUNATIC
                              (grunting)
                         Gower! 

               Tries to block Billy's way, but BILLY shakes his head, 
               brushes by him - determined.  
               

               AHMET Slides up next to BILLY in his rags.

                                     AHMET
                         Good morning, my American friend!  
                         There will be trouble if you go 
                         this way. A good Turk always walks 
                         to the right. Left is communist.  
                         Right is good. You must go the 
                         other way... It's Good.  
                         

               More LUNATICS join the flow, gesturing or grunting at BILLY.

               BILLY STOPS, turns, looks at the rest of them slogging in 
               the usual direction, looks as if he 'sees' them; and he 
               walks out of the wheel, towards the stairs.

               AHMET curious about his unusual behavior, follows BILLY.  

                                     AHMET
                         Why you go?  Why don't you walk 
                         the wheel with us?
                              (suspiciously leaning 
                              forward, suddenly 
                              realizing the answer)
                         The bad machine doesn't know he's 
                         a bad machine. You still don't 
                         believe it? You still don't believe 
                         you're a bad machine?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET at the base of the 
               STAIRS. BILLY carries on up the stairs.

                                     AHMET
                              (shakes his head)
                         To know oneself is to know God, my 
                         friend. The factory knows.  That's 
                         why they put you here. You'll see.  
                         You'll find out. Later on you'll 
                         know.

               BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET.  His eyes glint 
               with special knowledge and he takes AHMET into his 
               confidence using the latter's tone of voice:

                                     BILLY
                         I already know. I know that you're 
                         a bad machine.  That's why the 
                         factory keeps you here.
                              (Lowers s voice)
                         You know how I know?  I know because 
                         I'm from the factory. I make the 
                         machines.. I'm here to spy on you.

               Eyes narrow. Surprise. Fear. He shuffles away.

               BILLY looks at him and turns up the STAIRS.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY in his BED. The usual UPROAR. THE ATTENDANT comes by 
               with the pills, offers a handful to BILLY.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Hop!  Hop!  Take!

               He takes them, puts a few into his mouth, swallows.  
               Reflective, unsure.  A RADIO playing OFF blares suddenly 
               with the U.S. Armed Forces Station - JANIS JOPLIN singing 
               "Take another piece of my heat now, Baby" then it's switched 
               back to a TURKISH STATION, loud. Billy rises.

               BILLY enters the TOILET with the PHOTO ALBUM tightly 
               clutched under his arm. A dark stone room, very shadowy. 
               Piles of waste on the floor. A vacant-eyed barefoot LUNATIC 
               shuffles past BILLY who goes to one of the four partitioned 
               HOLES cut into the floor.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY squats over it and with his filthy 
               long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the 
               album Susan gave him. Flickering shadows. He looks up 
               absently.

               THREE LUNATIC FACES stare in at him through wooden slats, 
               tongues hanging out and drooling - playing with themselves - 
               OFF.

               BILLY makes a lunatic face and SCREAM kicking at the 
               partition.

                                     BILLY
                         Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! 

               THE LUNATICS, petrified, scatter off but ONE LUNATIC skids 
               in a puddle of urine and crashes onto the tile howling.

               BILLY slits open the binder to reveal TEN HUNDRED DOLLAR 
               BILLS with Pictures of Mr. Franklin' neatly inserted.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               BILLY has no particular expression on his face.  Reflective, 
               staring at the money; he looks up.

               A LARGE SILHOUETTE is moving towards him.

               BILLY just watches, transfixed, not trying to hide the 
               money.

               HAMIDOU comes into a faint light, looking down at him; 
               glances at the money. Shakes his head gently.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         No do!  No do! 

               Reaches for and:

               ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the money from BILLY like 
               candy from a baby, then takes him by the ear and slowly 
               lifts him up.  Billy is like a vegetable in his hands.

                                     HAMIDOU
                              (in his broken 
                              English)
                         I tell you I see 'gain...
                              (into Turkish)
                         I take you down to bath and your 
                         feet be big like...Breasts
                              (a gesture)

               HAMIDOU leads BILLY roughly out of the lunatic room, pulling 
               him by the ear.

               HAMIDOU still Pulling BILLY by the ear, guides him through 
               the GUARD QUARTERS.

               HAMIDOU leads him up a narrow winding flight of STAIRS.

                                     HAMIDO
                         First you make mistake with Ziat, 
                         now you make mistake with money.  
                         You're not a new Prisoner, Vilyum 
                         Hi-yes.

               The tone of his voice indicates a severe reckoning this 
               time.

               HAMIDOU pulls BILLY by the ear into a large echoing BATH.

               BILLY looking, bent over by the ear - a hint of awareness 
               of new surroundings.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - the BATH is deserted, spooky with greenish 
               Yellow fish light flittering down from holes in ceiling 
               around damp mossy arches. Steam rises off a bath.  Benches, 
               buckets of water.  HAMIDOU swings BILLY around until he is 
               facing him. 

               HAMIDOU makes an elaborate gesture of putting aside his 
               falaka stick and holstered gun; he will use his hands.

                                     HAMIDOU
                              (shakes his head)
                         You've been in prison too long, 
                         Vilyum Hi-yes.

               He takes that: stiff arm all the way back to its full arc 
               and WHACKS BILLY up against the wall.

               BILLY bounces back off the wall. The print of Hamidou's 
               fingers is imbedded like a flaring white rainbow in the 
               redness of his left cheek. SLAM -  a backhanded whack. 
                
               BILLY bounces right back from the wall. steadies him.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         You go crazy here Vilyum Hi-yes. 
                         Many people go crazy here. Best 
                         thing for crazy people is this...

               THE BLOW, in SLOW MOTION comes sailing into:

               BILLY, and we see the brief boxer's distortion of all his 
               face as he flies upwards and back into:

               THE BENCH smashing it. Echo like jarring F.X.

               BILLY is held up by the PAJAMAS, steadied. The Turkish 
               words seem far away, incomprehensible.

                                     HAMIDOU (OFF)
                         Vilyum Hi-yes. You die here, Hi-
                         yes.

               WHACK - ANOTHER BLOW, but:

               HAMIDOU this time holds onto the pajamas using Billy like 
               a punching bag.

               WHACK - A REVERSE BLOW.

               HAMIDOU increasingly excited. 

                                     HAMIDOU
                         Babba sikijam!  I fuck your mother, 
                         I fuck your sister...

               WHACK - ANOTHER BLOW in SLOW MOTION

                                     HAMIDOU
                         ...I fuck your father, I fuck your 
                         brother...

               RIP! - a loud SOUND as HAMIDOU moves with a blur of speed, 
               and shreds BILLY's pajamas with his hands.

               BILLY naked, totally passive, semiconscious. HAMIDOU 
               suddenly shifts position and snaps Billy into a strenuous 
               wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor. He 
               loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back.

               HAMIDOU - sweat pouring off his face, excited.

                                     HAMIDOU
                         ...And I fuck your grandmother and 
                         I fuck your pretty girlfriend... 
                         And I fuck you Hi-yes!)

               A bizarre otherworldly scene. This man is dredging Billy 
               through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the 
               sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam 
               bath as a bedroom. He loosens his hold abruptly, rises, 
               moves off as:

               BILLY holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest, 
               gasping for breath, about to vomit. Pause; he looks up 
               horrified at: 

               HAMIDOU pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor.  
               SSSSSSSSSS!  The awakened STEAM coils like a snake into 
               every cranny of the little room.

               BLURRED VISUALS - HAMIDOU stripping his shirt off. A huge 
               muscular flash of chest,

               A BELT being snapped open.

               BILLY waiting.

               A FIGURE moving through the steam, closer.

               BILLY backing away from it.

               STEAM - a glint of a FACE coming through.  HAMIDOU - his 
               eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun 
               cutting haze. Then disappear again.

               BILLY pulls back. A pause. Silence. Cat and mouse.  Then 
               very suddenly:

               A HAND reaches out of the STEAM and GRABS BILLY by the 
               hair.  A GRUNT, OFF.

               BILLY his eyes moving fast.

               A FLASH of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting 
               forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from 
               the rest of the body.

               A SOUND - grotesque and so sudden after the silence it 
               jars the senses. A BLURRED VISUAL then:  
                
               BILLY Launching forward in SLOW MOTION, desperation 
               distorting his features and: 
                
               STEAM - then BILLY'S HEAD SLAMS through it in SLOW MOTION 
               and:

               SMASHES the penis with its skull. A horrifying GASP.

               BLURRED VISUALS - STEAM - HAMIDOU staggering CLOSE - 
               surprise, pain...

               BILLY MOVING.

               A FOOT coming up fast through the steam, connecting again 
               with the genitals. Another SCREAM.

               A BODY hitting the tiles.

               BILLY groping for the falaka stick. Raises it. 
                
               A STRUGGLE - Two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming 
               now in pain. A definitive sound then a THWACK! Another 
               thwack!  The steam seems to clear and

               BILLY is on top of the gigantic HAMIDOU smashing him with 
               the falaka stick with all his might. 
                
               HAMIDOU is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding.

               His HAND gripping BILLY by the neck, forcing him back and 
               strangling him at the same time. Billy is red in the face, 
               such is the force of this creature but continues to beat 
               him, harder, harder.  His expression filled with a life 
               energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost.  
               Again, Again -

                                     BILLY
                         Babba sikijam, Hamidu!  I fuck your 
                         Mother, I fuck your daughter, I 
                         fuck your sons, I fuck your wife!

               The BAND slips from his throat, then springs up desperately 
               again and clenches Billy's whole face with one gigantic 
               palm, clawing to get in, then just as quickly slips away.  
               BILLY beats on - again, again.

               BLOOD flows fast in agitated swirls into the little pool.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY opens a door gently, moves across an empty CORRIDOR, 
               dressed in and gun in intense. Hamidou's holster. large 
               uniform with his He looks shaken, weak, falaka stick dizzy

                         How about a shoe shine, friend?

               BILLY starts, clenches the falaka stick ready to spring, 
               spins.

               A LITTLE SHOESHINE BOY is his case down the corridor.

               BILLY has not seen a child in a long time. get words out, 
               then manages: Surprised.  Can't get the words out, then 
               manages:

                                     BILLY
                         No! 

               THE KID shrugs, moves on, looking At Billy strangely.

               BILLY goes up a flight of STAIRS.  Ahead, VOICES passing.  
               He stops. Goes on.

               BILLY goes through an empty GUARD QUARTERS.

               BILLY is in another CORRIDOR, approaches

               A SMALL PORTAL, daylight at its edges.  Locked?

               BILLY, tense, tries it. It swings open on:

               DAYLIGHT!

               BILLY squints.  Adjusting to the harsh sensation.

               AN ISTANBUL STREET - TRAFFIC, SOUNDS.  TWO GUARDS 
               approaching the portal in the distance, drinking soda pop.

               BILLY steps back, straightens his clothes, steps out briskly 
               and at such an angle that  

               THE TWO GUARDS don't notice him in the traffic  as they 
               enter the open portal.

               LONG SHOT - BILLY walking down the street, looking back, 
               almost bewildered, not quiet believing this. 

                                                                    CUT:

               TIGHT - RAILROAD TICKET being stamped.  SOUND - SNAP.  
               MOVE UP to TICKET CLERK behind a grill.

                                     VOICE (OFF)
                         Edirne to Uzun Kopru?

               THE CLERK looks puzzled.

               BILLY is on the other side of the grill.  A ill-fitting 
               new Western style suit, a hat over his dyed black hair; 
               totally paranoid. He hasn't slept in three days and the 
               bruises from the Hamidou beating now show clearly black 
               and blue on his face. His eyes are alert, darting around, 
               his speech clipped and to the point.

                                     BILLY
                         What's the matter?

               THE CLEF!!  Shrugs.

                                     CLERK
                         'What are you crazy? There's no 
                         train anymore to Uzun Kopru, it'd 
                         have to go through Greece. The 
                         border's closed.

               BILLY taken by surprise.

                                     BILLY
                         No train?

                                     CLERK (OFF)
                         No more train.

               BILLY Moves off a small provincial RAILROAD DEPOT - DAY.  
               He looks at the:

               EMPTY TRACKS - No 'midnight express'.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY, tenser than ever, uses the occasion of buying a 
               newspaper at an OUTDOOR STAND to study:

               THE MAIN SQUARE of the VILLAGE (EDIRNE) - DAY. SOLDIERS 
               and POLICE are abundant, chattering bustling amid tanks 
               and half-tracks.  Mountains can be seen in the far distance.

               BILLY camouflages his face as best he can in the Newspaper 
               "Hurriyet" studying:

               CABDRIVERS in the Main Square.  Most of them are older, 
               grizzled looking standing next to their old battered dusty 
               cabs talking with stray SOLDIERS. Billy's eyes settle on a 
               YOUNGER DRIVER with longish hair, possibly an ally.

               BILLY glances down at his newspaper as a SOLDIER intersects 
               and his expression goes stony as he sees:

               FULL COLOR DRAWING (first page) of a ridiculously fierce 
               heavy-muscled barechested MAN beating a facsimile of Hamidou 
               into the ground.  Next to it a blurry badly reproduced 
               photograph of BILLY with a superimposed GUN in his hand. 
               You can't really tell it's him.

               BILLY, controlling himself, crumples up the newspaper into 
               a baton, his eyes everywhere.  Be the darting A crosses 
               square.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, intersecting a POLICEMAN who glances 
               at him, joins the YOUNG CABDRIVER..

                                     BILLY
                         Listen, I have Swedish friends 
                         camping south of the town. I was 
                         supposed to meet them here this 
                         morning but I was late. Can you 
                         take me there?

               DRIVER looks at him neutral.

                                     DRIVER
                         You know where they are?

                                     BILLY
                              (anxious to get in 
                              the cab)
                         Sure.

                                     DRIVER
                         How far?

                                     BILLY
                              (impatient)
                         About ten kilometers.

                                     DRIVER
                         Sixty Lira?

                                     BILLY
                              (surprised)
                         Sixty?

               Billy eyes:

               APPROACHING SOLDIERS.

                                     BILLY (OFF)
                         Okay.

               THE DRIVER, noticing Billy's look at the soldiers, gets in 
               the cab.

               BILLY climbs into the back seat, feeling already he has 
               made a mistake. There is something too alert, too hard in 
               this young driver.

                                                                    CUT:

               BILLY P.O.V. - THE MOUNTAINS as they roll in the taxi.  
               FORESTS - FIELDS.

               INTERIOR TAXI

                                     BILLY
                         Those mountains? are they?

                                     DRIVER
                         (Greece  
                              (shakes his head)
                         Very bad now. Maybe war. Those 
                         Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus 
                         again
                              (pause))
                         How'd you lose your friends?

               BILLY leaning back in his seat, casual.

                                     BILLY
                         Oh, I drank a lot of raka last 
                         night in Istanbul. Got into a fight.

               Indicates the bruises on his face.

               DRIVER looking at him in the rear view mirror. His curiosity 
               narrowing.

                                     DRIVER
                         How come you speak Turkish so good?

               BILLY casually glances out the window.

                                     BILLY
                         Did twenty months in prison in 
                         Istanbul.  Hash

               THE DRIVER studies BILLY in the rear-view mirror. Then:

                                     DRIVER
                         You want to score some?  Cheap?

               BILLY looks at him hard. Something's wrong with this man.

                                     BILLY
                              (curt)
                         No!

               Cutting off further conversation, he looks out at:

               THE MOUNTAINS of Greece - with longing.

               BILLY stares back at:

               THE DRIVER whose eyes now move away from the rear-view 
               mirror under the pressure of the stare.  SOUND OFF loud 
               machinery.

               BILLY turning - in rear window, we see a TURKISH HALFTRACK 
               pulling alongside the cab, SOLDIERS waving their arms for 
               the cabdriver to get out of the way.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - the HALFTRACK pulls level. The CABDRIVER 
               slows down, with a curse.

               BILLY - beads of sweat trickle his brow 

               THE PERSONNEL CARRIER, disinterested, pulls past.

               BILLY breathes heavily with nervous relief.

                                                                    CUT:

               THE CAB pulls up to the end of a dirt road.

               BILLY has his MAP out, studying it.

                                     BILLY
                         The Maritas River? Where is it?

               ANOTHER ANGLE - the DRIVER, exasperated, waves southwest.

                                     DRIVER
                         Two miles! Minefields over there.  
                         Do you know where this campground 
                         is or not?

                                     BILLY
                         Not far. Just a little way.

                                     DRIVER
                         No!  I'm not going any further!  
                         It'll wreck my car.

                                     BILLY
                         I'll pay extra

                                     DRIVER
                         How much? 

               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY slips him fifty lira. The DRIVER 
               takes it, muttering under his breath, jams the cab into 
               gear.

               THE CAB follows rutted tracks into low HILLS.

               INTERIOR CAB - very bumpy.

                                     BILLY
                         Where are the minefields?

                                     DRIVER
                         All over.  Turkish Army up there.  
                         It's against the law. They shoot 
                         us.
                              (looks up in the 
                              mirror)
                         You sure you looking for your 
                         friends, man?

                                     BILLY(VERY SHARP NOW)
                              (very sharp now)
                         Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm 
                         getting tired of all this bullshit 
                         from you.  I'll walk it.

                                     DRIVER
                              (looks back, then 
                              ahead, suddenly 
                              brightening)
                         Ah, look!  they probably know where 
                         the campers are

               BILLY's entire expression changes. It is all over.

               A TANK AND HALFTRACK are sitting there by the rutted track, 
               with SOLDIERS. And a little LEAN-TO with several POLICE.  
               Also a couple of attack DOGS on leashes. The Driver honks 
               his horn on the approach.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     DRIVER
                         Hey officer, we're looking for the 
                         campground. Do you know where it 
                         is?

               ANOTHER ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN and A SOLDIER come sauntering 
               over, their collars open, beer bottles in hand, slightly 
               drunk.

                                     POLICEMAN
                              (curt)
                         You're not supposed to be here

                                     DRIVER
                              (indicated Billy)
                         He's a tourist, what do you want, 
                         he says he's looking for friends 
                         at the campground. 

               FIRST POLICEMAN glances BILLY

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Campground?
                              (shrugs)
                         Never heard of one.

                                     DRIVER
                         Seen any Swedish foreigners in a 
                         camper-bus?

               SECOND POLICEMAN meanwhile eases his arm down on the OPEN 
               WINDOW bringing BILLY into foreground. The COP'S mouth is 
               open and exhaling a wave of beer breath over-BILLY.

               BILLY P.O.V. - BEER FACE FOCUS PAST him to SOLDIER at tank 
               reading "Hurriyet" - the picture of BILLY on page one, 
               spread for all to see.

                                     BEER FACE
                         Noldu? 

               DRIVER turning around to address him.

                                     DRIVER
                         Seen any foreigners in a camper 
                         bus?

               SOLDIER circles the cab from the other side.

               BILLY motions to the DRIVER.

                                     BILLY
                         Okay, they haven't seen him, let's 
                         go back to town, it's getting late.

               THE DRIVER ignores it. Calls out again, louder to BEER 
               FACE.

                                     DRIVER
                         Foreigners!  KAMPER.  VOLKSWAGEN

               BILLY rigid. This asshole of a driver!

               BEER FACE glances at BILLY, pulls his head out the window.

               Looks down the road. Takes a sip of beer.

               SOLDIER, disinterested, moves back towards the tank.

               BEER FACE looks in the other direction down the road, 
               burps.Very conscious of his authority, shakes his head 
               without looking at the driver.  Moves away.

               BILLY nudges the DRIVER.

                                     BILLY
                         Okay, let's go. 

               THE DRIVER impatiently turns and looks straight at BILLY, 
               aware of his anxiety.

                                     DRIVER
                         Is no Volkswagen, man! Something 
                         wrong with you?

               BILLY hardening.

               DRIVER calling out.

               BEER FACE turns.

               DRIVER leans out the window.

                                     DRIVER
                         This guy's fishy...I think he might 
                         be trying to get to Greece.

               BILLY looks around fast.

               BEER FACE starts back lazily, half drunk, with the OTHER 
               POLICEMAN

                                     BEER FACE
                         Huh?

               DRIVER

                                     DRIVER
                         I don't know, there's

               His eyes grow big suddenly As he sees the barrel of 
               Hamidou's REVOLVER right in His cheek.

               BILLY all business, very quiet.

                                     BILLY
                         Get out -- right now, move!

               BEER-FACE advancing looks puzzled, thinks he sees something, 
               then crouches as:

               DRIVER gets out the door crouching, yells.

                                     DRIVER
                         He's got a gun!

               BILLY firing SHOTS off to distract them has climbed over 
               the front seat, jams the cab into gear. It stalls! Again 
               he tries, and now shoots off.

               THE CAB Roars past the roadblock.

               THE COPS AND SOLDIER, scattered by the shots, now scream 
               at each other. They run.  SHOTS are fired.

               BILLY guns the cab down the road, flying.

               CLOUDS OF DUST trail the cab.

               THE TANK starts to roll after it. Full speed. The HALFTRACK 
               follows, the MEN riding it shouting.

               BILLY looks back, then looking ahead sees something.

               P.O.V - a speck in the far distance. Another ROADBLOCK.

               BILLY decides, then - 

               THE CAB swerves right off the road and jumps into the gently 
               rolling FIELD on the border of the road, pock marked with 
               HILLS.

               THE TURKS come roaring down the road, pointing to the cab.

               LOW ANGLE - the TANK makes a flat out stop, gears grinding.

               THE GUN TURRET swings left.

               THE CAB in the far distance, at an angle to the tank, starts 
               running up an incline.

               THE TANK FIRES.

               P.O.V. - SHELL BLASTS WIDE OF THE CAB. 

               BILLY, startled, looks back, guns for the top of the 
               incline.

               HIS P.O.V. - ANOTHER SHELL now blasts to his front right, 
               closer. Something heavy (shrapnel) thuds into the rood of 
               the cab.

               BILLY drives all out.

               P.O.V. - THE INCLINE CLOSER, CLOSER, ABOUT TO MAKE IT, 
               THEN: A BLAST

               TANK P.O.V. - the CAB spinning in the blast of the adjacent 
               shell-burst.

               BILLY, shaken but unhurt, staggers out of the cab, looks:

               P.O.V. - A WHEEL BLASTED AWAY, FUEL PISSING OUT FROM THE 
               SHRAPNEL HOLES, SMASHED WINDSHIELD AND FENDER.

               THE TURKS are coming up the incline now, like the Cavalry --
               some on foot running, others on the HALFTRACK.  BULLETS 
               whistle and pop nearby.

               BILLY running. He tears off his jacket.

               SOLDIERS pass the wrecked car, at the top of the incline 
               shouting, pointing and firing at

               BILLY in the distance.

               ONE SOLDIER seems lighter than the others and takes off in 
               a sprint as the OTHERS follow.

               THE HALFTRACK now crests the incline and gathering full 
               gear and momentum, roars off down the slope after Billy.

               CLOSE BILLY running sweat all over him. In background, the 
               HALFTRACK and running FIGURES.

               BILLY runs into a high dry cornfield with the sun starting 
               to set ahead of him in the Greek mountains.

               MOUNTAINS - must make those mountains.

               BILLY running all out - eyes fixed on them, breathing, 
               skipping heartbeats.

               THE PERSONNEL CARRIER bypasses the FAST SOLDIER who slows 
               down, panting. Billy has outrun him.

               OTHER SOLDIERS run up in the distance.

               BILLY, tireless, obsessed, runs right into a POPPY FIELD.It 
               is a splendid beautiful scarlet red, set off by the dipping 
               rays of the sun.

               HIS FEET smashing down the poppy plants.  Fast - THUCK!  
               THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!

               CROSSCUT the metal TREADS of the Halftrack into the poppy, 
               mowing down entire rows.

               TWO SOLDIERS on the PERSONNEL CARRIER are waving 
               encouragement to the driver inside. They have him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE the HALFTRACK closing the distance on BILLY 
               now thirty yards apart.

               BILLY looking back, starting to fade. Huge wheezing gasps 
               of breath.

               SOLDIERS running up looking at 

               THE HALFTRACK in the distance.

               SOLDIERS yell.

                                     SOLDIERS
                         Minefield!  Minefield! Come back!  
                         Stop!  
                              (NO SUBTITLE)

               BILLY runs out of the POPPY FIELD into a THIN FOREST.

               THE SOLDIERS screaming in the distance, jumping up and 
               down waving for the halftrack to come back.

               LOW ANGLE - the HALFTRACK with the waving SOLDIERS on board 
               now blasts out of the poppy field at full speed.

               BILLY -- he has no chance, In immediate background is the 
               fast HALFTRACK.  

               ONE SOLDIER on the HALFTRACK now looking back to the SHOUTS 
               of his comrades. Confused. Turns bout back to yell something 
               and:

               ENORMOUS EXPLOSION The HALFTRACK disintegrates in a tank 
               landmine.

               BILLY thrown to the ground by the force of the blast, looks 
               back, GASPS!

               A BURNING WRECKAGE. Black spirals of smoke.  Secondary 
               explosions.

               BILLY stumbles up. A gash of blood is on his temple but he 
               doesn't know it or feel it such is his stress. He runs on, 
               SHOTS whistling towards him from the poppy field.

               TURKISH OFFICER screaming angrily at Billy, cursing, shaking 
               his fist at the sky.

               BILLY, in the forest, is totally out of breath and out of 
               eyesight of the pursuers. He stops against a tree.  FROG 
               SOUNDS. The gurgle of water. Muddy ground. He looks:

               THE MARITAS RIVER rushing ahead. A strong current.

               BILLY peels off all his clothing except his pants, not 
               delaying one more moment. He feels he must keep going. And 
               he's right. DOGS are barking OFF.

               A SNARLING ATTACK DOG is tearing through the minefield, 
               fast, ahead of the others.

               BILLY looks, sees it.

               THIRTY YARDS - the huge DOG coming right at him!

               BILLY runs for the edge of the bank and plunges in.

               THE ATTACK DOG sprints up to the edge of the river bank 
               and without a moment's hesitation, plunges right in after 
               him.

               BILLY lashing into the current with a fierce breast stroke, 
               is swept downstream kicking futilely.

               THE DOG, its jaws open and clacking, is also swept down 
               river.

               BILLY going under, coming back up - fighting, still 
               fighting.

               THE DOG struggling sails past as

               BILLY hauls himself out of the river, going in a circle, 
               dizzy. Falls. Struggles up again. Looks back. Must keep 
               going. Must.

               THE BASE OF' MOUNTAIN - hilly, rugged.

               BILLY runs, drags, runs again.  He is a lamentable sight - 
               naked except for ripped wet pants, barefoot, bleeding, 
               muddied.  Dimly he makes out:

               A FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT. Some cows, goats, chickens. NO 
               sign of people.

               BILLY staggers towards it. Wears something. A rooting SOUND.  
               Stops. Something familiar about it.

               A FAMILY OF PIGS snort and root in the mud, little piglets 
               running around.

               BILLY staggers towards them, muttering to himself.

                                     BILLY
                         Pigs...!  Pigs...! 

               Then yells in the recognition of it

                                     BILLY
                         Pigs... You... Beautiful... 

               BILLY BILLY falls to his knees in the confined pen; the 
               pigs run around squealing. Trying to reach out for one of 
               them, he falls face first into the mud and lies there. 
               Pause.  A wooden DOOR squeaks open OFF. BILLY slowly turns 
               his muddy eyes over his shoulder.

               BILLY P.O.V. - TWO SOLDIERS, khaki-colored uniforms, 
               helmets, olive faces, mustaches, approach cautiously from 
               the farmhouse, rifles ready.  Following them is an OLD 
               FARMER, Further behind in the doorway is his WIFE and 
               CHILDREN.

               BILLY muttering to himself, in Turkish.

                                     BILLY
                         Greek?...  Greek?... 

               THE SOLDIERS approach close, stand above this strange 
               figure, look at each other.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Ti leei?
                         (What is he saying?)

                                     2ND SOLDIER
                         Mou fainetai san Toupkika
                         (It sounded like Turkish) 

               BILLY with dimming strength.

               BILLY

               THE FARMER understands, makes a vigorous nod of his head.

                                     FARMER
                         Malisee...Ellada! 
                         (Ah, yes...  Greece!)

                                                                    CUT:

               CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUT - and BILLY, his movements still weak, 
               moves a few steps from the car and stops.  SUBTITLE:

                        OCTOBER 24, 1975 - BABYLON, LONG ISLAND

               Framing Billy are SUSAN and his FATHER, both silent.  They 
               look with him at

               HIS SISTER, BROTHER, UNCLE, AUNT, SISTER-In-LAW FAMILY 
               FRIEND - AND GRANDMOTHER, all on the porch of the ordinary 
               house in BABYLON, LONG ISLAND - DAY; all of them returning 
               his gaze in that first SILENT moment. Curiosity. 
               Recognition. Shock. Love.

               And then they move. But we don't hear their movements. It 
               is SOUNDLESS reunion; the SISTER running out first in SLOW 
               MOTION, the MOTHER following last, crying; the GRANDMOTHER 
               too infirm to move, the shaking her head from side to side 
               in SLOW MOTION, her tears lost somewhere in the wrinkles 
               of her face. 

               BILLY surrounded by FAMILY - SLOW MOTION - SOUNDLESS.  His 
               eyes flooding. All the feelings in him.  And deep inside - 
               a solitary question.  

               EPILOGUE BLACK SCREEN - SUPERIMPOSE:

                       THE CHARACTER NAMED BELL IS STILL INSIDE.

                               (ROLL THE LIST OF NAMES) 

               And OVER this, the SOUND of a PASSING TRAIN rushing by in 
               the night - UP, FAST and AWAY.

          Close on a finger pressing the "record" button of a circa
          1970's tape recorder.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          This is Harvey Milk speaking on
          Friday November 18th. This is to be
          played only in the event of my
          death by assassination...
          REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a
          cluttered San Francisco apartment.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          During one of the early campaigns,
          I started opening my speeches with
          the same line and it sort of became
          my signature...

          2 EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT

          In street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City
          Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm
          here to recruit you.

          3 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          Harvey at his kitchen table making his recording...

          HARVEY MILK
          If I was speaking to a slightly
          hostile or mostly straight
          audience, I'd try to break the
          tension with a joke...

          4 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT

          Harvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a
          CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS.

          HARVEY MILK
          I know, I know, I'm not what you
          were expecting, but I left my high
          heels at home.
          Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE.

          5 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder.

          HARVEY MILK
          I fully realize that a person who
          stands for what I stand for - an
          activist, a gay activist - becomes
          the target or potential target for
          a person who is insecure,
          terrified, afraid or very disturbed
          themselves...

          6 INT. CITY HALL OFFICES - MONTAGE - DAY

          POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City
          Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking. Something terrible has
          happened. It's chaos.
          A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY
          BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it.
          The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly
          load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight.

          9 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL / FRONT STEPS - DAY

          A shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of
          REPORTERS. Those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd.

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          As President of the Board of
          Supervisors, it's my duty to make
          this announcement. Both Mayor
          Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
          have been shot... and killed.
          GASPS from the REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard.

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN (CONT'D)
          Police are looking for a suspect...
          Supervisor Dan White.

          10 INT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

          The very picture of loveliness, MARY-ANN WHITE, 28, finds her
          husband DAN WHITE, 31, sitting in the pews praying. He's a
          handsome, devout, all-American man in a three-piece suit.
          She sits by him. A weight hangs. He can't make eye contact.

          DAN WHITE
          Something has happened.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She
          holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to
          conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself.

          11 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder...

          HARVEY MILK
          Knowing that I could be assassinated
          at any moment, I feel it's important
          that some people should understand
          my thoughts. I think that--
          (pauses, not sure what to say)
          I wish I had time to explain
          everything I did. Almost everything
          that was done was done with an eye
          on the gay movement.

          13 INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

           TITLE: "New York City. 1970."
          HARVEY, 40, is HEADING UP THE STAIRS from the subway
          platform. He is wearing a SUIT, but he's less than clean cut.
          His hair is brushing past his ears.
          HARVEY'S VERY INTERESTED POV: SCOTT SMITH, 22, a sexy curly
          haired hippie in tight jeans and boots, is HEADING DOWN THE
          THE STAIRS. Harvey tries to make eye contact.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hey. I'm Harvey.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (so what?)
          Okay, Harvey...

          HARVEY MILK
          Today's my birthday.
          (Scott laughs)
          No, today is actually my birthday.
          Well, tonight. At midnight.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Really?

          

          

          

          

          4.

          HARVEY MILK
          And, believe it or not, I don't
          have any plans. People took me out
          after work...

          SCOTT SMITH
          (looking him over)
          Work? So, that would be... Let me
          guess. Ma Bell or AT&T.

          HARVEY MILK
          The Great American Insurance
          Company. I'm part of the big,
          evil, corporate establishment that,
          let me guess, you think is the
          cause of every evil thing in the
          world from Vietnam to diaper rash.

          SCOTT SMITH
          You left out bad breath.
          Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They
          both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor.
          A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work fast.

          HARVEY MILK
          So... You're not going to let me
          celebrate my birthday all by myself
          are you?

          SCOTT SMITH
          (gently teasing)
          Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute
          for a suit... But I don't do guys
          over forty.

          HARVEY MILK
          Well then, I'm in luck.

          SCOTT SMITH
          How's that?

          HARVEY MILK
          Because I'm still thirty-nine...
          (showing Scott his watch)
          And it's only eleven-fifteen.

          14 INT. HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT

          IN A TIGHT TWO-SHOT, Scott is pressed against a wall with
          Harvey pressed against his back having sex. Harvey is the
          aggressor, completely uninhibited.

          15 INT. HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Harvey feeds Scott spoonfuls of CREAM PIE from a TRAY FULL of
          FOOD that rests on the bed between them. Ice cream, cookies,
          milk, berries... It's over the top and adorable.

          HARVEY MILK
          Where are you from?

          SCOTT SMITH
          Jackson, Mississippi.

          HARVEY MILK
          Well, this isn't Jackson, but you
          still can't respond to every
          strange man you meet on a subway
          platform. It's too dangerous.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Now you tell me.

          HARVEY MILK
          There's nothing tougher than a New
          York City cop. They're arrogant,
          and they're everywhere. I'll show
          you the cruising spots, if you
          want, if you promise you'll be
          careful... little Scottie-san.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Are you on uppers or what?

          HARVEY MILK
          No. This is just... plain old me.

          SCOTT SMITH
          You're afraid of the cops?

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm just discreet. I know a lot of
          people here. If they found out, I
          could lose my job.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (meaning a closet case)
          Oh. You're one of "those."
          (examines Harvey's eyes)
          I think you need a change of
          scenery. New friends.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          HARVEY MILK
          I need a change.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (looks at the clock)
          You're forty now.

          HARVEY MILK
          (just the truth)
          Forty years old and I haven't done
          a thing I'm proud of.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (re: the desert tray)
          You keep eating like this and
          you'll be a fat ass by fifty.

          HARVEY MILK
          (laughs it off)
          No. Don't you worry. I won't make
          it to fifty.
          Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding,
          he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face.
          Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his
          young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting
          everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          (an idea, half-jokingly,

          HALF-SERIOUSLY)
          Why don't we run away together?

          SCOTT SMITH
          Where to?

          16 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          RETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. (Throughout
          the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is
          telling us things no one else knows.)

          HARVEY MILK
          In those days, San Francisco was
          the place where everyone wanted to
          go... To drop out... To fall in
          love...

          7.
          through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into
          San Francisco.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          But by 1972, The Haight was boarded
          up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The
          new place for us refugees was this
          run down Irish Catholic
          neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six
          blocks square... The Castro.

          17 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY

          Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of
          Castro Street.

          WE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE,
          a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows...
          Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro
          Theater, big letters spelling out... "C A S T R O..."
          Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray-
          haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his
          face, an expression of distrust.
          Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:

          "EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY."
          Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS
          WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's
          eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling.
          Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT
          SIGN hanging out front.

          19 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

          The place is FILLED with OPERA MUSIC from a record player.
          Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera.
          Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through
          the large, empty windows.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I cashed my last unemployment check
          yesterday...

          HARVEY MILK
          Well, I hope you did something
          useful with it.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I bought an ounce of pot. I was
          just wondering if you had any

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          8.

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          plans, or thoughts... About us
          doing something to, you know, bring
          in an income.

          HARVEY MILK
          Don't move.
          Harvey straddles Scott. He begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I suppose I can wait tables.

          HARVEY
          No way. I want you right here with
          me... Did you see place downstairs
          is for rent?

          SCOTT SMITH
          Yeah.

          HARVEY MILK
          I was thinking we could open a shop
          together.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What kind of shop?

          HARVEY MILK
          One with very little overhead. Not
          too much work... A little one, just
          like Morris and Minnie Milk of
          Woodmere, New York...

          20 EXT. CASTRO STREET CAMERA SHOP - DAY (1973)

          Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA
          STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products).
          Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside
          the store's large window hanging a sign: "CASTRO CAMERA."

          HARVEY MILK
          Just a little to the left...
          The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses
          the street to watch. Harvey gives him a warm welcome:

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Hello there. I'm Harvey Milk.

          MCCONNELLY
          You're the new renters?

          HARVEY MILK
          Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera.

          

          

          

          

          9.
          Harvey extends his hand. McConnelly shakes, but is wary.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          I want to join the, um... What is
          it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's
          Association. I want to help in any
          way possible. I'm no interloper.
          A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll
          forgive that.
          McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.

          MCCONNELLY
          I don't think your application will
          be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a
          family neighborhood. Your kind are
          far more welcome on Haight street.

          HARVEY MILK
          (trying to keep it friendly)
          What "kind" do you mean, sir?

          MCCONNELLY
          (not playing along)
          The Merchant's Association will
          have the police pull your license
          if you open your doors.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Based on what law?

          MCCONNELLY
          There's man's law and there's God's
          law in this neighborhood and in this
          City. The San Francisco Police
          force is happy to enforce either.

          HARVEY MILK
          (to McConnelly as he walks away)
          Thanks for the warm welcome to the
          neighborhood!

          SCOTT SMITH
          We pay taxes you know!
          Harvey grabs Scott's hand... keeps him from heating up, from
          pouncing. It's not the time for them to bite yet.

          21 INT. HARVEY AND SCOTT'S APARTMENT ABOVE THE STORE -- DAY

          Scott is sitting on the bed, while Harvey is TALKING A MILE A
          MINUTE FROM THE KITCHEN, totally energized.

          

          

          

          

          10.

          HARVEY MILK
          We'll form our own business
          association! Start with the gay-
          owned businesses... We'll take down
          the addresses of every customer that
          comes in for a roll of film. We'll
          ask them what they want to see done
          here... what they want changed...
          We'll get money rolling into this
          neighborhood. Revitalize it...

          SCOTT SMITH
          Can I come in now?

          HARVEY MILK (O.S.)
          One more minute!
          (back to his new scheme)
          I'll go to the neighborhood banks.
          They must have some gay customers.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey. What's with all this
          political activist crap? I thought
          you were a goddamn Republican.
          Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of
          food. He sets them out on a small dining room table, still
          rambling on to Scott in the bedroom.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm a businessman, Scott. I think
          businesses ought to treat their
          customers right. Even their gay
          customers. For God's sake, this is
          San Francisco!

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey. It's just like every other
          city in this country. People hate
          us. Big surprise.

          HARVEY MILK
          We should have at least one block
          in one city right? Start there and
          take over the neighborhood.
          (a smile)
          Okay, you can come in now!
          Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a
          home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Wow. This is--

          

          

          

          

          11.
          Harvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face. Payback.

          HARVEY MILK
          Happy birthday!
          Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear
          some of the CREAM PIE onto him.

          22 EXT. THE CASTRO - DAY

          The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street
          Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate
          outside Toad Hall bar.
          ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about,
          eyeing the scene skeptically.
          Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.

          MAN ON THE STREET
          Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk!

          HARVEY MILK
          Thanks for joining the Castro
          Village Association!
          Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the
          Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them,
          into the store, leaving Scott outside.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Excuse me gentleman... ladies.
          (finding the shop owner)
          Hello! Mr. McConnelly!
          McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new
          business.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          I just wanted to stop in and see
          how business was doing.

          MCCONNELLY
          Fine.

          HARVEY MILK
          So you don't mind all these
          homosexuals in here, do you?
          McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is
          curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly
          here loves our kind. Spend away!
          (to McConnelly)
          Tell your wife Hello for me.
          Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM,
          KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step
          back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing.
          Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him
          through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new
          neighborhood.

          23 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT


           HARVEY MILK
          And people started hanging around
          our store. Not customers.
          Activists, kids, folks who needed a
          home away from home...

          26 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - INTERCUT

          A NEW sign goes in the window: "We are VERY open."

          27 INT. CASTRO CAMERA SHOP - DAY

          A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings
          of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a
          clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the
          arts, and checking out the cute ones.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute
          art student who I'd picked up at
          Toad Hall. Turns out he was also
          good at running the Camera Shop...
          something Scott and I found we had
          surprising little interest in...
          ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.

          DANNY NICCOLETTA
          Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about
          street theater, now.

          HARVEY MILK
          What you're not getting is the
          spectacle of it, the bigger than
          life emotions...
          Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of
          an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great
          wit. A Harvard graduate, which
          nobody cared about, in those days,
          in the Castro... including himself.
          JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that
          sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for
          something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young
          man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And somewhere along the line Jim
          picked up a protege, a cute
          political kid from Wisconsin... Dick
          Pabich... And of course there was
          Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular
          business with the new kids...
          DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And on occasion we actually had a
          real customer. But only occasionally.
          ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of
          place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey... This guy wants to talk to
          you.

          HARVEY MILK
          (approaches Allan)
          Welcome. What can we do for you?

          ALLAN BAIRD
          Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters
          representative, and Director of the
          Coors beer boycott in California.

          HARVEY MILK
          Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's
          a very big deal, so behave
          yourselves.

          ALLAN BAIRD
          I was told you were like the Mayor
          of the Castro, said you organized
          the CVA, you might know some people
          in the bars.

          

          

          

          

          14.

          HARVEY MILK
          I do have friends in awfully low
          places, but just so you know, it's
          not official yet.

          ALLAN BAIRD
          What's that?

          HARVEY MILK
          The Mayor part. I've considered
          gathering an army of queers to
          march up to City Hall and secede,
          but so far the young gays seem more
          interested in jeeps and jeans. But
          if I could be of any use, I'm all
          ears!

          ALLAN BAIRD
          We can't get Coors to go union.
          These guys are like me, they can't
          be out of work too long.
          Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his
          nerves. It's Harvey at his best.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm just curious. Are we your first
          stop or your last?

          ALLAN BAIRD
          (clearly his last)
          It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.

          HARVEY MILK
          Well, you seem to have noticed that
          my kind of people drink a lot of
          beer. If we're going to fast for
          your sake, I think we should get to
          deliver some of it when you win
          this fight, don't you?

          ALLAN BAIRD

          (INCREDULOUS)
          Is that what you really want?

          HARVEY MILK
          And allies. I'll have Coors out of
          every bar in the Castro by the end
          of the week. Deal?

          ALLAN BAIRD
          (nods, sincere)
          Thank you Mr. Milk.

          

          

          

          

          15.
          JUMP TO: Allan is on his way out. Harvey walks back behind
          the counter to Scott.

          HARVEY MILK
          No more Coors beer. It's gotta come
          out of every bar. Gay and straight.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What's he giving you?

          HARVEY MILK
          Nothing for me. That's a convert.

          SCOTT SMITH
          A convert to what?

          HARVEY MILK
          The cause.

          27A INT. VARIOUS SAN FRANCISCO BARS - PHOTO MONTAGE

          A STILL PHOTO MONTAGE: Jim, Dick, Scott and Danny get bar
          owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps,
          throw out their Coors stock, put on "Boycott Coors" buttons
          and tape up "Dump Coors" posters.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          I got "my people" to get Coors out
          of all the Gay Bars. 30 million
          bottles worth in San Francisco
          alone. Coors beer immediately fell
          from number 1. They caved. One week
          later, union man Allan Baird hired
          the first ever openly gay union
          boys to drive Teamsters trucks...
          We weren't just a group of pansies
          anymore. We had a neighborhood. We
          had the unions. And for the first
          time, we had a little bit of power.

          27B INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT


           HARVEY MILK
          Maybe that was the day someone
          first called me the "Mayor" of
          Castro Street.
          (a knowing grin)
          Or perhaps I invented it myself.

          28 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - ANOTHER NIGHT

          Harvey, Jim & Dick, Scott, Danny and Dennis debate the merits
          of working within "the system" versus dropping out. Everyone
          is talking over each other...

          

          

          

          

          16.
          A YOUNG GAY MAN runs into the store.

          YOUNG GAY MAN
          The fucking cops, man, they're up on
          Castro Street! Toad Hall.
          Harvey and the guys race out of the store.

          29 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY

          Harvey, Scott, Jim, Dick, Dennis run up the street toward one
          of the Castro GAY BARS where POLICE ARE GETTING OUT OF SQUAD
          CARS AND APPROACHING CUSTOMERS crowding around the entrance.

          COP
          Clear the sidewalk!
          Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of
          them don't move FAST ENOUGH. The COPS start BEATING them.
          Harvey, Scott and the OTHERS try to break into the crowd, to
          get closer to the fight. To pull the cops off their friends.
          Danny HANGS BACK, snapping PHOTOS of the event.
          Scott SHOVES his way past the cops. A COP BRINGS HIS NIGHT
          STICK down hard on SCOTT'S HEAD.

          30 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

          Scott sits on the toilet. Harvey rinses blood from a white
          washcloth and goes back to cleaning Scott's HEAD WOUND.

          HARVEY MILK
          ...if we had someone in the
          government who saw things the way
          we see them, the way the black
          community has black leaders who
          look out for their interests--

          SCOTT SMITH
          You're gonna run for Supervisor, is
          that the idea?

          HARVEY MILK

          (HALF-JOKING)
          I could go right for mayor, but I
          think I should work my way up to
          it... You'll be my campaign
          manager.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          SCOTT SMITH

          (SARCASTIC)
          Because I have so much experience
          in politics.

          HARVEY MILK
          Politics is theater. It doesn't
          matter if you win. You make a
          statement. You say, "I'm here, pay
          attention to me."

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey, you do that every time you
          cross the street.

          HARVEY MILK
          Coors looks like it might cave. The
          union boys will owe me. Imagine if
          we get their vote... It'll be fun!

          SCOTT SMITH
          Fun?
          Harvey starts kissing him all over.

          HARVEY MILK
          We'll make it a spectacle.

          31 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY

          Harvey walks down to Market St. with a box. He waves, shakes,
          flirts with everyone. His warmest hello is from a gruff UNION
          MAN. Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart.
          Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It
          reads, âSoap Box.â Harvey steps onto it. A crowd forms.

          HARVEY MILK
          A week ago, Police officers came
          into our area with covered up
          badges and sent fourteen of our
          people to the hospitals, and to
          jail. The charges, "Blocking a
          Sidewalk."
          Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a
          blown up PHOTO from his shopping cart: TWO SF COPS DRAGGING

          GAY MEN INTO A PADDY WAGON.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          --Let us have our tax money go for
          our protection and not our
          persecution. Worry about gun
          control and not marijuana control.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          School supplies, seniors, not what
          books I read--
          Scott displays an old "Muscle Boys" magazine. Harvey does a
          well timed take. A few hoots from the eclectic crowd.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          My fellow degenerates, I would like
          to announce my candidacy for San
          Francisco City Supervisor!
          Scott unfurls three hand made "MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR"
          banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart.

          32 EXT. VARIOUS STREETS IN SF - HANDING OUT FLYERS MONTAGE

          WE SEE SCOTT, DANNY, JIM handing out FLYERS to a variety of
          SF CITIZENS: gay boys, older people, Chinese people, scared
          straight people, heckling high school boys.
          Harvey EAGERLY APPROACHES anyone and everyone, shaking hands
          if they'll let him, reaching out to old people, straight
          people, gay people, even buttoned down BUSINESSMEN who cross
          the street to try to get away from him.

          33 EXT. THE CASTRO/18TH AND CASTRO - DAY

          Harvey hands out campaign literature to a PASSERSBY.

          HARVEY MILK
          Public dental care for retired
          people... Legalize pot, vote Milk.
          Harvey is distracted. A young, long haired CLEVE JONES
          passes. At 18, he looks 15. Harvey tries for his attention:

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Hey, I like the way your pants
          fit... Where are you from, kid?

          CLEVE JONES

          (LAUGHS)
          Sorry old man, not interested.

          HARVEY MILK
          Where's home?

          CLEVE JONES
          Phoenix.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm Harvey Milk. I'm running for
          Supervisor. What's your name?

          

          

          

          

          19.

          CLEVE JONES
          Cleve... Jones.

          HARVEY MILK
          Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up
          to my camera shop and register you.

          CLEVE JONES
          Fuck that. Elections of any kind
          are a bourgeois affectation.

          HARVEY MILK
          Is that right? Do you trick up on
          Polk Street?

          CLEVE JONES
          (only half-joking)
          If I need the cash... But I'm
          selective about my clients.

          HARVEY MILK
          Tell me one thing before you get
          back to work then. What was it like
          to be a little queer in Phoenix?

          CLEVE JONES
          I faked a lung disease to get out
          of PE. So what? What are you, some
          kind of street shrink?

          HARVEY MILK
          Sometimes. But what I'm saying is,
          Phoenix can change. But we have to
          start with our street: rent control,
          police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.

          CLEVE JONES
          (turns to go)
          Well, good luck with all that.

          HARVEY MILK
          You know what I think, Cleve Jones?

          CLEVE JONES
          That you're gonna get somewhere if
          you keep talking?

          HARVEY MILK
          No. That you need to do what you're
          good at. Be a prick. Fight City
          Hall. Fight the cops. Fight the
          people who made you come here to do
          what you do.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          CLEVE JONES
          Sorry old man, I'm leaving for
          Spain tomorrow. Europe. Got all the
          cash I need in my back pocket.
          A GROUP OF CLEVE'S FRIENDS shout at him to join them. Harvey
          watches him dart across the street to his friends.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          I didn't come out until very late
          in life. There was nobody to--

           HARVEY MILK
          --look up to, no hope for a better
          life. Those that did were
          outcast... arrested.. suicide. And
          the young ones, who did escape
          home... and who arrive in San
          Francisco, and then what...

          35 EXT. CHURCH STREET - EVENING

          ANGLE ON: PARAMEDICS placing a BLOODY VICTIM into a BODY BAG.

          COP
          The âfruitâ was walking home with
          his âtrickâ when they were jumped.
          REVEAL: Harvey picks a blood stained whistle up off the
          street, the man's last attempt to call for help.

          COP (CONT'D)
          (from the victim's wallet)
          Name's Robert Hillsborough. Did you
          know him?

          HARVEY MILK
          He used to come into my shop. Are
          there any witnesses?

          COP
          Just the "trick." Jerry Taylor.

          HARVEY MILK
          Jerry wasn't a trick. They were
          lovers.

          COP
          Call it what you will. He's our
          only witness and he says he can't
          identify the attackers.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          HARVEY MILK
          There'd be a dozen witnesses if
          they thought you boys had any real
          interest in keeping them safe.

          COP
          You're the Mayor of Castro Street
          now, right Harvey? You really wanna
          help? Get your people to show some
          discretion on the streets, huh?
          HARVEY'S POV: The PARAMEDICS pull up the zipper on the body
          bag. We follow the zipper past the victim's bloody hands, his
          torso, his face.

          36 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - DAY


          CLOSE ON: A CUSTOMER'S SET OF PHOTOS BEING PASSED FROM HAND
          TO HAND DURING THE FOLLOWING POLITICAL MEETING. (We catch a
          glimpse of the PHOTOS and see naked skin).

          JIM RIVALDO
          Well, it looks like the big guns
          and the rich gays in San Francisco
          are going to back Dianne Feinstein
          and other straight candidates they
          consider "gay-friendly."

          SCOTT SMITH
          Who cares about those old queens?
          Scott is laying down on THE BIG RED COUCH.

          HARVEY MILK
          Why isn't my campaign manager
          leading the meeting?

          SCOTT SMITH
          I'm beat, Harvey. I passed out
          flyers for seven hours straight.

          HARVEY MILK
          In the bathhouse?

          SCOTT SMITH
          (giving it right back)
          People in bathhouses vote. I'm
          tired. I'm taking a nap.
          Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment.
          A CUSTOMER comes in. Danny quickly gathers the REVEALING
          PHOTOS and puts them back in the envelope.

          

          

          

          

          22.

          HARVEY MILK
          Just checking the exposure. That a
          new boyfriend? He's very cute.

          CUSTOMER
          (taking the photos, embarrassed)
          Um... Thanks, Harvey.

          HARVEY MILK
          (to Jim)
          So who are these so-called "gay
          leaders?" And who appointed them?
          And what are you suggesting, Jim,
          that I'm supposed to go and solicit
          their endorsement?
          PAST HARVEY WE SEE A GRANDMOTHERLY VOLUNTEER, THELMA, opening
          the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and
          approaching Harvey.

          THELMA

          HARVEY--

          HARVEY MILK
          We're down here, on the streets,
          trying to help people, so where
          they hell are they?

          Scott reads the LETTER. Harvey sits VERY STILL.

          SCOTT SMITH
          "Harvey Milk will have a dream
          journey and nightmare to hell, a
          night of horror. You will be

          I'm calling the police.

          HARVEY MILK
          They probably wrote it.
          (off Scott's anxiety)
          Hey, If somebody tries to kill me,
          I'll get the sympathy vote, right?
          Could be just the push we need.

          SCOTT SMITH
          You think this is funny?
          Look at it.
          Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott.

          HARVEY MILK
          It's a complete joke. No rhythm. No
          humor. It's insulting.
          CLOSE ON THE LETTER: Someone has drawn a STICK FIGURE of
          Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc. Harvey
          makes a DECISION: He sticks the DRAWING to the refrigerator,
          the first thing he'll see in the morning.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Don't do that.

          HARVEY MILK
          If you put it away, hide it in a
          drawer, it'll just get bigger and
          scarier. Now it's there. We'll
          see it every day. It can't get us.

          SCOTT SMITH
          All this energy... to make yourself
          a target. And what for? Something
          we have no chance to win.
          Harvey wraps his arms around him.

          HARVEY MILK
          I keep telling you, it's not just
          about winning.

          38 EXT. DAVID GOODSTEIN'S MANSION - DAY

          Harvey, in his work boots and jeans, watches as a LARGE GATE
          SLIDES OPEN allowing his entry. Scott, even scruffier looking
          than Harvey, stands next to him.

          Scott strips off his clothes and DIVES INTO THE POOL.

          40 EXT. GOODSTEIN'S POOL - LATER

          Harvey has lunch with the "gay establishment": DAVID
          GOODSTEIN, 58, gold and turquoise jewelry, and Goodstein's
          protÃ©gÃ©, RICK STOKES, 45, reserved.
          Rick can't keep his eyes off naked Scott in the pool.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          I worked for a financial
          institution. I was very discreet.
          But someone spotted me at the
          opera, sitting in a box, next to my
          lover. And I was fired. That's
          when I decided to do something. So
          I bought The Advocate. And I use
          my money and my influence in quiet
          ways, to do what I can...

          HARVEY MILK
          Endorsing straight candidates is
          what you think is best to help us?

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          Yes, if they're friendly to our
          cause.

          citywide office. Political alliances
          need to be built. You can't simply
          move here from across the country
          and run for office.

          HARVEY MILK
          But I am running for office. I'm on
          the ballot. I have the union rank
          and file, the seniors, and I could
          use your magazine's endorsement.

          

          

          

          

          25.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          Harvey, we're like the Catholic
          church. We welcome converts, but we
          don't make them Pope the same day.

          HARVEY MILK
          And why haven't you run?

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          It's too early for a gay candidate
          for Supervisor. Especially one
          from the Castro. It's bad for the
          community's image.
          Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table, naked and
          sopping wet.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What's wrong with the Castro?

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          Nobody works there. It's all sex
          and drugs and more sex and no one
          taking responsibility for their own
          problems.

          HARVEY MILK
          The cops come into our neighborhood
          and beat us. They turn a blind eye
          if one of us is murdered.

          RICK STOKES
          Then we file a lawsuit against the
          city. We go to our political allies
          in City Hall...

          HARVEY MILK
          There are no real gay allies. Yes,
          our friends may sense our struggle,
          but they can't feel it. It's not
          life or death for them. We need our
          own in office.

          RICK STOKES
          You can't demand acceptance overnight.

          HARVEY MILK
          Why not? How can we ask them to
          respect us if we don't show
          ourselves some self respect, David.

          

          

          

          

          26.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          The more âoutâ you make us, the
          more you incite them. Step back and
          quiet down.

          HARVEY MILK
          Go back into the closet? Is that
          what you're saying? Because I know
          the closet. I lived in it for more
          years than I care to remember.
          (rising to go)
          I don't need your endorsement. I'm
          not asking anyone for acceptance.
          I don't have time to ask.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          For you, politics is a game, a
          lark. Like putting on a rock
          festival or staging a "love-in."
          You're too old to be a hippie,
          Harvey Milk!
          Harvey turns around, ready for a fight.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm not a candidate, I'm part of a
          movement. The movement is the
          candidate. There's a difference. You
          don't see the difference. But I do.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (getting Harvey out)
          Thanks for the swim. I'm sorry I
          pissed in your pool.

          41 EXT. THE CASTRO - ELECTION DAY

          A SLOW MOTION MONTAGE OF: the citizens of the Castro are
          turning out to vote. Young, old, gay, straight... but a
          weight hangs over the day.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          When the vote came in on election
          day... out of 32 candidates vying
          for 6 seats... We came in 10th.
          Just a handful short of being the
          first big eared, gay as a three-
          dollar-bill, cock sucker ever
          elected to public office.

          42 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT


           HARVEY MILK
          So... I went for it again in '75...
          with just a few... minor...
          adjustments.

          43 INT. SECOND HAND STORE IN THE CASTRO - DAY

          CLOSE ON: Harvey looking through a hole in the bottom of a
          pair of well worn wing-tips. He tries them on anyhow.
          JUMP TO: Harvey steps out of a dressing room in a brown suit.
          His hair is cut short, his face is shaven clean. It's quite a
          transformation. Scott and the old owner, LILY, size him up.

          SCOTT SMITH
          No. Not cute. The shoes are hideous
          and I hate your hair. You're not
          fooling anybody.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm not gonna let the Pacific
          Heights biddies write me off again
          because of a ponytail. I like it.
          Scott is horrified. Harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs
          from its inner pocket.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Cabaret? For two? Lily, is this
          from one of my kind?

          LILY
          No, no. You won't run into the
          owner. He died in that suit.

          SCOTT SMITH
          This isn't sexy, Harvey.
          Harvey grabs Scott, kisses him. Then playful:

          HARVEY MILK
          Too bad. No more pot, no more bath
          houses for me and little poo.

          44 INT/EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - DAY

          MONTAGE: More ACTIVITY inside and outside the shop. More
          VOLUNTEERS. The printing press burns through flyers.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          We ran and we lost the Supervisors
          race a second time in '75, but with

          more votes than ever. So in 1976,
          against everyone's advice, I really
          pissed off the Democratic political
          power houses, because I ran against
          "their boy"--

          A SIGN GOES IN THE SHOP WINDOW "HARVEY MILK VS. THE MACHINE."

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          --Art Agnos, a part of their
          "Political Machine." And this time
          we weren't running for City
          Supervisor. This time it was
          bigger, California State Assembly.

          50 INT. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW / CANDIDATE DEBATE - NIGHT

           It's a firestorm of words as Harvey debates Art Agnos.

           HARVEY MILK
          It's a racket. It's 1976 and you
          still have to be straight, white,
          Catholic and male to get into the
          San Francisco police force. It's
          Racist. Homophobic.

          ART AGNOS
          How many people do you consider
          enemies, Harvey? I've counted five
          already.
          Art smiles. Chuckles flutter through the audience.

          HARVEY MILK
          You're right, Art. And many are
          your closest friends. You see, I
          don't think State Assembly seats
          should be awarded on the basis of
          service to the Democrat Machine.
          Machines operate on oil and grease.
          They're dirty, dehumanizing, and
          too often unresponsive to any needs
          but those of the operator.

          ART AGNOS
          Mr. Milk, I've worked for years as
          a social worker in this city. I
          know Sacramento. I know how to get
          done what we all need done there.

          HARVEY MILK
          Tell me Mr. Agnos... right here in
          the Castro, Robert Hillsbourough
          was murdered for walking home with
          his long time partner. Stabbed,

          fifteen times. The last words he
          heard were "Faggot, Faggot,
          Faggot..." And you say you're
          outraged, but why won't your
          liberal establishment return our
          calls? Why won't they bring these
          murderers to justice?

          51 EXT. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW - LATER

          Art Agnos puts his arm around Harvey as they walk out.

          ART AGNOS
          You know Harv', your whole rap's a
          real downer.

          HARVEY MILK
          My God, you're handsome up close. I
          can't tell you how much I'm looking
          forward to licking you... in the
          polls.

          ART AGNOS

          (LAUGHS)
          You talk a lot about what you're
          against. What are you for? In this
          town, you gotta give em' a reason
          for optimism or you're cooked.
          Art gets into his car and goes. Harvey has no car. He stops
          and PONDERS ART'S WORDS... They stick with him.

          51A INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S APARTMENT - EVENING

          Scott tries to make a simple meal of pasta, struggling to
          operate in the kitchen that is filled with Harvey's POLITICAL
          ENTOURAGE and VOLUNTEERS.
          He finds Harvey, Jim, and Dick having an impromptu strategy
          meeting in the adjoining bedroom.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey. Dinner.

          HARVEY
          ... get some union boys in the
          audience, they love me...

          JIM RIVALDO
          I can't control who's in the
          audience...

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey, you need to eat something.
          Now.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          Scott steps back into the kitchen.

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          Ladies and Gentlemen. Our apartment
          is officially off limits.
          CHASES the VOLUNTEERS out of the kitchen, out of his
          bedroom... down the stairs...

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          Downstairs. Time to go. Go. OUT!
          Harvey emerges, about to intervene.

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          Don't say anything.
          For once, Harvey keeps his mouth shut. Jim and Dick sneak
          past Scott, sheepishly. When Scott and Harvey are alone...

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          Sit down and eat.
          Harvey and Scott eat dinner in tense silence.

          HARVEY

          SCOTTIE--

          SCOTT
          If you say one thing about politics
          or your campaign or where you're
          speaking tonight or whose
          endorsement you need... I'll stab
          you with my fork I swear to God.

          HARVEY
          I just wanted to say... This is
          the most delicious meal I've ever
          eaten in my entire life.
          Harvey gives a warm smile. Scott gives a laugh, but he looks
          like he's about to lose it.

          HARVEY MILK
          If we lose this one, it'll be just
          me and you again. I promise.
          Scott nods. That's exactly what he needed to hear.

          52 EXT. THE CASTRO - NIGHT

          Harvey walks Castro's streets alone, toward his apartment.

          

          

          

          

          31.
          A CAR PULLS UP BEHIND HARVEY. A MAN jumps out of the car, and
          the driver speeds around the block. Harvey turns a corner.
          The man follows. Harvey picks up his pace. He searches his
          pockets for a whistle, a weapon, and beelines it to his shop,
          his nerves are failing him.
          He gets to the doorway of his camera store, and runs face
          first into: CLEVE JONES. He's not the feisty young kid he met
          on the street earlier. He's been sitting on Harvey's steps,
          waiting with wet eyes.

          HARVEY MILK
          Phoenix?
          (off Cleve's smile)
          We should go inside.
          They do. Harvey locks the door behind them.

          53 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - LATER

          Harvey pours two cups of coffee, and delivers one to Cleve
          who is pulled away on the big red couch.

          CLEVE JONES
          You staying up with me?

          HARVEY MILK
          The election's tomorrow. I won't
          sleep... Was he good looking?

          CLEVE JONES
          No. He was hideous.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hard to tell what's worse. With me,
          my boyfriends usually find better
          looking ones to cheat with.

          CLEVE JONES
          I thought we were gonna spend the
          rest of our lives together.

          HARVEY MILK
          Guess what, Cleve Jones.

          CLEVE JONES
          What?

          HARVEY MILK
          You're going to meet the most
          extraordinary men, the sexiest,
          brightest, funniest men, and you're
          going to fall in love with so many
          of them, and you won't know until

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          the end of your life who your
          greatest friends were or your
          greatest love was.

          CLEVE JONES
          Is that supposed to help?

          HARVEY MILK
          Maybe a little. Or not.

          CLEVE JONES
          I went to Spain last month... long
          story. In Barcelona, there was this
          memorial march for gay people who
          died under Franco. The police tried
          to break it up. It started a riot.
          A bullet ripped through a drag
          queens scalp, his wig flew off, but
          he kept fighting. There was blood
          literally running in the gutter.

          HARVEY MILK
          We could have a revolution here
          too. But you can't just use the
          Castro to cruise. You gotta fight.

          CLEVE JONES
          You think you'll win?

          HARVEY MILK
          Winning isn't my strong suit.

          CLEVE JONES

          (BRAVADO)
          Well, I don't "do" losing. Ever.
          Maybe I should run for office, and
          you can work for me.
          (off Harvey's laugh)
          If you can do it, I can do it.

          HARVEY MILK
          Can you assemble a thousand people
          in an hour?

          CLEVE JONES
          Yeah, sure.

          HARVEY MILK
          All right, if I run again, you're
          my man.

          CLEVE JONES
          If...?

          bus stops.

          54 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

          Harvey is on the back of a motorcycle. The driver heads up
          Market Street. Folks stand in voting lines, flags outside of
          polling places. City Hall's tall dome grows nearer.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          And we lost that Assembly Race too,
          which made me a bona fide three-
          time, political loser.

          55 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON THE TV SET PLAYING A 1970's ORANGE JUICE COMMERCIAL
          featuring runner up to Miss America, ANITA BRYANT.

          ANITA BRYANT (SINGING ON TV)
          "Come to the Florida sunshine tree,
          great tasting orange juice
          naturally, orange juice with lots
          of vitamin c, from the Florida
          sunshine tree."
          Harvey is alone in the shop, surrounded by remnants of a
          celebration party that never happened.
          Jim Rivaldo lets himself into the store. Jim has his maps
          rolled up under his arm.

          JIM RIVALDO
          (trying to cheer up Harvey)
          We lost, but we lost by less! More
          votes than ever...
          (Harvey fake grins)
          I remember when that used to work.
          I want to show you something. This
          is remarkable.
          Jim starts laying out his trusty MAPS, color coded with
          precinct results from that night.

          JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D)
          The red is where you did best
          tonight. If we can get the
          initiative on district elections to
          pass, and we can -- we can -- our
          new Supervisor's District will go
          right up Market. Right around the
          Castro.

          The district Jim outlines is ALL BRIGHT RED.

          JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D)
          If you run for Supervisor with this
          new district, it's a potential
          landslide. You'll be the first up-
          front gay man elected to major
          office in the U.S.

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't know if I have another one
          in me. Or Scott.
          But Harvey's gaze deceives his words. HOLD ON HARVEY -
          contemplating a FOURTH run for office.

          57 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - THE SAME NIGHT


          ON THE TV: A REPORT ABOUT ANITA BRYANT'S VICTORY IN FLORIDA.

          TV REPORTER
          Gays in Florida can now be removed
          from their jobs and prosecuted if
          their "deviant" lifestyles are
          uncovered.

          BLOWING WHISTLES, raising TRASH CANS... It might turn into a

          Harvey's PHONE RINGS. He snatches it up.

          HARVEY MILK
          Scottie?

          BOY'S VOICE
          I'm sorry sir. I um... I read about
          you in the paper.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm sorry. I can't talk right--

          BOY'S VOICE
          Sir, I think I want to kill myself.

          HARVEY MILK
          No. You don't want to do that.

          (BEAT)
          Where do you live?

          BOY'S VOICE
          In Minnesota.

          HARVEY MILK
          You saw me in a paper in Minnesota?
          How'd I look?

          BOY'S VOICE
          My folks are taking me to this place
          tomorrow. A hospital. To fix me.

          HARVEY MILK
          There's nothing wrong with you.
          Listen to me. You don't have to
          hurt yourself, okay? Are you there?
          (only breathing from the
          other end)
          Here's what you have to do. Are you
          listening?

          BOY'S VOICE
          Yes.

          HARVEY MILK
          Get on a bus. Go to the next
          biggest city. New York, San
          Francisco, LA, or even Minneapolis.
          It doesn't matter. Just leave.
          (off the boy's tears)
          You won't be alone. There are
          people out here just like you who
          will welcome you and love you.

          You're not sick. You're not wrong.
          God does not hate you. Just leave.

          BOY'S VOICE
          I can't.

          HARVEY MILK
          Yes. You can. Just get on a bus.

          BOY'S VOICE
          I can't... I can't walk, sir. I'm
          in a wheelchair... Sir. Are you
          there?
          Harvey FORCES HIMSELF TO SOUND CALM...

          HARVEY MILK
          That's okay. It's going to be okay.
          Over the phone, Harvey hears the SOUND OF AN ADULT VOICE,
          someone finding the BOY on the phone, then...
          The LINE goes DEAD. It's all too much for Harvey. There's
          nothing a speech or a pep talk can do to fix this. Harvey is
          overwhelmed. Dick comes upstairs.

          DICK PABICH
          Harvey, you better come down.
          There's gonna be a riot.
          Moving in a daze, stunned by the call, Harvey digs out A
          BULLHORN and heads out.

          58 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - SAME

          From inside, SCOTT WATCHES HIS LOVER JUMPING BACK IN THE
          FREY. A weight hangs. He doesn't follow...

          58B INT. CASTRO STREET BAR - NIGHT

          Cleve RUSHES into the bar (ON FIRE WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY) and
          BLOWS A POLICE WHISTLE to get everyone's attention.

          CLEVE JONES
          Out of the bar and into the
          streets! Anita Bryant is coming
          after you!

          59 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - NIGHT

          Angry young men mill around the streets, their rage building.
          Someone TOSSES a trash can and it ROLLS.
          A POLICEMAN in riot gear comes up to Harvey.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          POLICEMAN
          If you can't control em', we will.

          HARVEY MILK
          Give me permission to march them.

          POLICEMAN
          Where?

           HARVEY MILK
           Anywhere.

          60 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          Surrounded by the massive crowd, HARVEY CLIMBS THE LARGE BOX
          that covers the subway construction at Market and Castro.
          It's a stage of sorts. Harvey lifts his bullhorn to his lips.

          HARVEY MILK
          I know you are angry. I am angry.
          Follow me through the streets of
          San Francisco to share our anger!
          Harvey jumps down and begins walking, not sure if the mob
          will follow. Finally, they do. Cleve catches up.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Are they following in back?

          CLEVE JONES
          Yes. Where are we going?

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't know.
          (off Cleve's concern)
          We have to keep them moving.
          Exhaust them. March them till they
          drop. We can't have a riot tonight.
          Harvey LIFTS THE BULLHORN. He starts a marching chant. The
          crowd starts following along.
          JUMP TO: Gays glare at cops. Cops beat their nightsticks
          against their chests and power poles. Anger burns as Harvey
          marches the mob toward City Hall. Dick and Jim catch up.

          DICK PABICH
          They're still too hot in back.
          They'll burn the joint down.

          HARVEY MILK
          Help me turn them up Van Ness.
          We'll go all the way to Broadway.

          

          

          

          

          38.
          Dick heads back to try and wrangle the crowd. Harvey
          continues marching.

          61 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Harvey arrives, the crowd still hot. Cops beat their
          nightsticks against their shields. Some jab protesters,
          trying to incite a fight. Anger burns.
          Harvey climbs the steps, his stage. He lifts his bullhorn.

          HARVEY MILK
          My name is Harvey Milk... And I
          want to recruit you.
          The CROWD ROARS APPROVAL.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          I am here tonight to say, we will
          no longer sit quietly in our
          closets. We must fight. Not just in
          the Castro, or San Francisco, but
          everywhere the Anitas go. Anita
          Bryant did not win tonight. Anita
          Bryant has brought us together...
          She is going to create a national
          gay force!
          (The crowd ROARS)
          And the young people in Richmond,
          Minnesota, or Jackson, Mississippi,
          or Woodmere, New York... Who are
          coming out and hearing Anita Bryant
          on television telling them that
          they're wrong, they're sick, that
          there is no place for them in this
          great country, in this world...
          They're looking to us for something
          tonight...
          (his big moment, realizing
          his true mission)
          And I say, we have to give them
          hope!
          The CROWD goes WILD. HARVEY'S SPEECH CROSSES THE CUT TO...

          there are thousands upon thousands
          of frustrated, angry people such as

          What if she strolls into the Castro
          for a cocktail?
          (Scott keeps packing)
          Just one more. We can't let Rick
          Stokes take it.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Let Rick have it. Nobody thinks
          you're a fraud here, Harvey. You're
          not in New York, you're not a
          closet case asshole anymore. People
          respect you here. Relax for a year.
          Get us back on our feet.

          HARVEY MILK
          If people are ever going to take me
          seriously, I have to win this one.

          took you seriously?

          HARVEY MILK
          Anita wants to put us all back in
          concentration camps. Rick Stokes is
          too weak to beat her back if she
          gets to California. I have to be in
          office to protect us from them.

          you're not here, I'll see you in
          the shop next week.
          Scott picks up his box of clothes and starts out of the
          apartment. Harvey, not meaning a word:

          If you leave me right now... I can
          find someone new.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I know. You're a catch.
          Scott leaves. Harvey is in shock, unable to comprehend the
          loss. Unable/unwilling to reverse the choice he's made.

          The ENTOURAGE is completely caught up in the new campaign
          (Cleve, Jim, Dick, and newcomer MICHAEL WONG, 23, asexual and
          devoutly political). Harvey is RANTING, ripping down an
          Assembly campaign poster.

          ANNE KRONENBERG, 23, parks her motorcycle outside, WALKS INTO

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Hi guys. Mr. Milk... Rick Stokes
          isn't pulling out. He's officially
          filed to run against you. My friend
          at The Advocate says David
          Goodstein is backing him.

          MICHAEL WONG
          A gay candidate against a gay
          candidate. It's unfortunate.

          JIM RIVALDO
          They'll split the gay vote. The
          straights will divide and conquer.

          HARVEY MILK
          Try to find out when they're going
          to announce.

          DICK PABICH
          You replaced Scott with a lesbian?

          HARVEY MILK
          Anne worked on a recycling campaign
          up North. She's very organized.

          JIM RIVALDO
          How do you know she's not a plant
          from Rick Stokes' campaign?

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Are you guys always this paranoid?

          MICHAEL WONG
          Yes. They take after Harvey.

          HARVEY MILK
          Shouldn't you be doing someone's
          laundry?

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          (pointed at Jim Rivaldo)
          Sir, my girlfriends say you guys
          don't like women. Just asking, is
          there a place for us in all this,
          or are you scared of girls?

          

          

          

          

          43.

          HARVEY MILK
          Gentleman, we already have a tinker
          bell, a lotus-blossom, Jim and Dick
          in your three-piece suits. We need
          someone to manage things. A woman
          this time. She's the right price, and
          she has bigger balls than any of you.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Just give me whatever's left over in
          the register at the end of the day.
          So should I call the Chronicle about
          getting US an endorsement? No?
          OFF the group of misfits, considering the addition.

          69B INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE A LECTURE HALL - NIGHT

          PAN OFF: a large "RICK STOKES, SUPERVISOR DISTRICT 5" poster
          to reveal Anne Kronenberg outside the hall handing "MILK"
          signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are
          filing in.
          Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the
          lecture hall and confronts Anne.

          RICK STOKES
          Young lady, you must be confused.
          This is my night, not Mr. Milk's.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          (as pleasant as can be)
          No, sir. I'm Harvey's new campaign
          manager. Anne Kronenberg.

          RICK STOKES
          Then you should know this race is
          for District 5, the Castro, not for
          all of your lesbian... compadres--
          A tough lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads
          in. Rick looks uncomfortable around all these women.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          I'm sorry. Are we distracting you,
          Mr. Stokes? I'd hate to screw you
          up on your big night.
          Dick runs up looking for more fliers. Taking Rick even more
          off his game, Dick is flirtatious.

          DICK PABICH
          Hi Rick, handsome suit. Annie, do
          you have any more hand cards?

          DICK PABICH
          Not true. Guess where we found them
          all, Rick? A slew of them. Way up
          on Valencia Street. Living right
          there in our district. And you see,
          as it turns out, Annie here is
          very, very popular with the ladies.
          Dick puts his arm around Anne. Rick is stupefied.

          70 EXT. SF STREET - DAY

          Dozens of supporters hold "MILK for Supervisor" signs in a
          long line along Market St. waving to commuters. Anne walks
          the long line, handing out new signs to arriving volunteers.
          Harvey is handing out FLYERS. He is exhausted, his throat is
          RAW. The campaign is nearly over.
          A WEIRD MOMENT: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands him a
          flier. ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY'S EYES
          lock into the BOY'S EYES.
          Harvey reads the FLIER: âUnite and Fight for Dan White.â
          Harvey looks back to pat the BOY'S head, but he's gone. He
          looks to the sidewalk for the kid... a parent... nothing...

          71 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT

          Harvey is still looking at the flier. Anne is leaving with a
          stack of SF Chronicles. Cleve comes in, pulls one off her
          stack, and looks for "the article."

          HARVEY MILK
          They've accused me of many things,
          but never as blatant a lie as this.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          First ever newspaper endorsement.

          CLEVE JONES
          (reading the article)
          They endorsed you for being a good
          businessman? Has Scott read this?
          He'll piss himself.

          HARVEY MILK
          Yeah? Go show him.
          (Cleve starts to go)

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Cleve, maybe you should go find a
          boy to celebrate with. Just in
          case.

          CLEVE JONES
          I'm going to The Stud. Meet me out.
          Cleve goes. His energy is boundless. Harvey sits alone
          watching the bargoers return home through his front window. A
          bitter-sweetness lingers. A couple waves, one shouts out:

          GAY MAN
          Gonna win this time, Milk?
          They walk on, not waiting for an answer.
          Then, a drunk, cute, Latino, JACK LIRA, 25, stops. He stares
          in at the political ads in the window. Harvey watches him
          sway drunk out of his mind, waiting for him to fall. The two
          make eye contact. Harvey smiles. Jack tries to. Harvey picks
          up a folding chair and walks it out to him.

          JACK LIRA
          (re: poster in the window)
          You're more handsome in the
          posters.

          HARVEY MILK
          Thank you. Where do you live?

          JACK LIRA
          (too drunk to hear, flirting)
          ...Palomino's are my favorite
          horse. They're smart. They're
          fast and compact. Do you think I'm
          more like a Palomino or a Stallion?
          Jack smiles, out of his mind. Then he sits/falls down into
          the chair, and slides off. Harvey stands above the passed out
          young man. A newcomer. A wounded bird. Perfect.

          72 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Completely nude, Jack plays a tantalizing game of seduction,
          allowing Harvey to hold him, then wriggling away... Dancing
          against Harvey then BITING his shoulder... LYING on the bed,
          then ROLLING away when Harvey tries to hold him...
          No TALK. No POLITICS. Just SEX. A perfect RELEASE for
          Harvey.

          73 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Harvey holds Jack after lovemaking.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          JACK LIRA
          My father beat me when he found
          out... So I came here. I stay in this
          man's house. But I don't like him.

          HARVEY
          Shh, it's okay, now. No one's ever
          going to beat you again.
          A long, comforting beat between them.

          JACK LIRA
          I love you.

          HARVEY
          (smiles, playful)
          Do you even remember my name?
          (a beat, Jack shakes his
          head, he can't remember)
          Harvey.

          JACK LIRA
          I love you, Harvey.

          74 INT. VOTING BOOTH - DAY

          HARVEY stands in a voting booth. He goes down the list of
          names. He finally punches the one next to "HARVEY MILK"
          District 5, and pulls the lever. The chads fall.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          And for the first time in my life,
          it all came together... the union
          boys, the women, the seniors, the
          minorities... All of the us's
          showed up...

          75 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - ELECTION NIGHT

          TV lights blast Castro Camera. A raucous crowd pours into the
          streets to greet the roar of motorcycles. Anne pulls up with
          the Sheriff on back. Harvey is passenger on a second bike.
          HARVEY IS VICTORIOUS! He is instantly swarmed.

          76 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - LATER

          The Shop is packed. It's a giant celebration party. Anne and
          Cleve are working the door. SCOTT SMITH WATCHES FROM THE
          CROWD OUTSIDE THE SHOP as Rick Stokes and David Goodstein try
          to get in.

          RICK STOKES
          We just want to congratulate him.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          CLEVE JONES
          I'm sorry. We're all full.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          (seeing Harvey inside)
          Harvey! Harvey!

          HARVEY MILK
          It's too crowded. Sorry!
          JACK LIRA shoves his way toward the door...

          JACK LIRA
          Harvey!
          Harvey PULLS JACK INSIDE, right past Goodstein and Stokes.
          Harvey CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF SCOTT OUTSIDE...

          HARVEY MILK
          Scottie--?
          But Scott fades into the CROWD. Harvey (with Jack at his
          side) is pulled back into the party.

          CLEVE JONES
          (eyeing Jack skeptically)
          The new Mrs. Milk. I give it a
          week.

          JACK LIRA
          (the crowd)
          Harvey, is this all for you? Are
          you this famous?

          HARVEY MILK
          No, darling. We do this all the
          time. Do you like it?
          Jim is calling out NAMES of the OTHER WINNERS.

          JIM RIVALDO
          Carol Ruth Silver... Gordon Lau...
          It's the most liberal Board in
          years!

          HARVEY MILK
          What about Dan White? Did he win?

          JIM RIVALDO

          (YES)
          We'll deal with him tomorrow.
          Harvey is DOUSED with champagne.

          

          

          

          

          48.
          JUMP TO: Harvey is interviewed by a TV REPORTER. Jack
          squeezes his way under Harvey's arm and into the picture.

          CHANNEL 5 REPORTER
          Does this mean, as many straights
          are concerned, maybe the gays are
          taking over San Francisco? Are you
          going to be a Supervisor for all
          the people?

          HARVEY MILK
          I have to be. That's what I was
          elected for. I have to be there to
          open up the dialogue for the
          sensitivities of all people, all
          their problems, the problems that
          effect this city effect all of us.
          (toasts the camera)
          Thank you San Francisco! Thank you!

          77 EXT. MARKET STREET MONTAGE - DAY - JAN 1978

          SET TO MUSIC: In his old brown suit, Harvey walks to City
          Hall with a crowd of supporters. The familiar faces now
          include Jack Lira.

          78 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

          On City Hall's steps, Mayor Moscone swears in HARVEY.

          HARVEY MILK
          I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear
          that I will support and defend the
          Constitution of the United States
          and the Constitution of the State
          of California against all enemies,
          foreign and domestic; and that I
          will well and faithfully discharge
          the duties upon which I am about to
          enter and during such time as I
          hold the office of Supervisor, City
          and County of San Francisco.
          Bulbs FLASH. A light rain begins to fall. Umbrellas go up.

          HARVEY MILK(CONT'D)
          Anita Bryant said gay people
          brought the drought to California.
          Looks to me like it's finally
          started raining!
          Cheers. Harvey is emboldened.

          

          

          

          

          49.

          79 INT. SCOTT'S APARTMENT / TV SET - MORNING

          Off a TV in Scott's NEW APARTMENT, we see a S.F. Morning show
          featuring new Supervisors, Harvey Milk and Dan White.

          HOST (ON TV)
          This will be the first time in many
          years that we've seen so many new
          faces on the Board of Supervisors.
          Do you think such diversity will
          cripple the Board?

          HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
          The name of the game on the Board
          is six votes to get anything
          passed. So, like it or not, Dan
          and I are now in bed together...
          politically speaking.
          THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program. He's been up
          all night.

          DAN WHITE (ON TV)
          I've assured Harvey here that my
          brochure's comments about "social
          deviants" referred more to junkies
          than to his people. See, I'm about
          to have my first child. I have to
          make sure this city remains a
          decent place to raise him.

          80 INT. TELEVISION STATION - MOMENTS LATER

          The segment over, sound assistants help Harvey and Dan remove
          their microphones. Harvey tries to draw Dan in:

          HARVEY MILK
          How long were you a fireman, Dan?

          DAN WHITE
          A couple of years.

          HARVEY MILK
          And before that... You were a
          police officer?
          Dan studies Harvey suspiciously... What's his point?

          DAN WHITE
          You have something against cops?

          HARVEY MILK
          No. They tend to have something
          against me.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          50.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          (seeing Dan react uncomfortably)
          But firefighters. Now those are true
          heroes... They supported me in the
          last campaign. I support them fully.

          DAN WHITE
          I appreciate it.

          HARVEY MILK
          I meant what I said. I'd like to
          work together.
          Dan hesitantly accepts Harvey's handshake. It's a step.

          DAN WHITE
          (cracking a smile)
          I'll see you at the office, Mr.
          Milk.

          81 INT. CITY HALL - DAY

          Harvey goes through the metal detectors at the entrance and
          finds Cleve in a NEW SUIT waiting for the elevator.

          HARVEY MILK
          What do you think of my new
          theater?

          CLEVE JONES
          A bit over the top.

          HARVEY MILK
          What's with the suit?

          CLEVE JONES
          I got it from a friend.
          Harvey leads Cleve from the elevator to the grand staircase.

          HARVEY MILK
          When you come here, I want you to
          wear the tightest jeans possible.
          Never blend in. And no elevators.
          Ever. Always take the stairs, you
          can make such a grand entrance
          going up the stairs.

          82 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

          Harvey leads Cleve down the hall of Supervisors' offices,
          passing Dianne Feinstein's open door.

          HARVEY MILK
          And street talk only around
          Feinstein. Shit, goddamn, fuck,

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          51.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          all that. It bugs the hell out of
          her.
          They arrive at his Lead Aide's desk: it's Anne Kronenberg.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Morning Annie, let's set Cleve up
          on mail.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Will do.

          HARVEY MILK
          Come into my office...

          83 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Harvey walks in. Michael and Jim are in a strategy session.

          HARVEY MILK
          The first order of business that
          will come out of this office is a
          city wide Gay Rights Ordinance.
          Just like the one Anita shot down
          in Dade County. What do you think,
          Lotus Blossom?

          MICHAEL WONG
          I think it's good. Not great.

          HARVEY MILK
          Then make it brilliant. I want
          Anita's attention here. In San
          Francisco. I want her to bring her
          fight to US... This Bill needs a
          unanimous vote. We need headlines.

          JIM RIVALDO
          Dan White won't vote for this.
          Harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall,
          indicating Dan is down there. Harvey whispers:

          HARVEY MILK
          Dan's fine. He's just uneducated.
          We can teach him.
          Dan pops his head into Harvey's office.

          DAN WHITE
          Harvey, committee meets at 9:30.
          Oh, hi Michael, Jim.
          (to Harvey)
          Hey, did you get the invitation to

          52.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          my son's christening? I invited a
          few of the other supes as well.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'll be there.

          DAN WHITE
          Great!
          All smiles, Dan leaves. Cleve mocks him. OFF Mike Wong's
          expression: THAT WAS BIZARRE.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Are you going?

          HARVEY MILK
          Hey. I'll let him christen me, if
          he'll vote for my Gay Rights
          Ordinance. We need allies. We need
          everyone.

          84 EXT. THE CASTRO - TWILIGHT

          The neighborhood is booming. Storefronts and sidewalks
          filled. This is not the rundown Castro that Harvey moved
          into 3 years ago.
          Harvey heads home, greeted by his PROUD CONSTITUENTS.
          He stops at the CAMERA SHOP when he notices a BROKEN WINDOW
          near the side entrance to his apartment.

          85 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - TWILIGHT

          Harvey RUSHES UP THE STAIRS into his apartment and finds:
          JACK LIRA - Lighting a candle on the table which has been set
          for a lovely, romantic dinner.

          HARVEY
          Jack?

          JACK LIRA
          Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're
          hungry. I only know how to cook one
          thing, but I make it good.

          HARVEY
          Did you... break in?

          JACK LIRA
          I asked the boy downstairs to let
          me in...

          HARVEY
          Danny?

          

          

          

          

          53.

          JACK LIRA
          He wouldn't let me in. So I came in
          this way. Your friends aren't very
          nice to me.

          HARVEY
          (avoiding the fight)
          I have a Town Hall meeting tonight,
          Jack.

          JACK LIRA
          You work too hard. I'm sorry about
          your window. I'll fix it tomorrow.
          (turning on the charm)
          Are you surprised?!

          HARVEY MILK
          Jack, I have to go. I have an
          invitation to a party tomorrow.
          Lots of rich people, politicians.
          We could get all dressed up...
          Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him
          through a simple dance.

          JACK LIRA
          So I could be the first lady?

          HARVEY MILK
          Uh-huh.

          JACK LIRA
          I watched TV here today. All day. I
          saw All My Children. They killed
          Margo. I knew it was going to
          happen. They try and trick you but
          it never works.

          HARVEY MILK
          (enjoying this)
          You always see it coming?

          JACK LIRA
          What? Killing the blonde? Every
          time. I'm good with that.
          (gets slow, sensual)
          I think now the old lady is going
          to have an affair. Then she'll get
          killed or married. Always one or
          the other. Dead or married.
          Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate.

          

          

          

          

          54.

          HARVEY MILK
          If I make you a key, you won't
          break my windows again, right?

          JACK LIRA
          That's right.
          The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be
          going back to work tonight.

          86 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

          Harvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY. He tries hard
          to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the
          only gay man at Dan's child's baptism.
          Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father. Harvey waves.

          87 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER

          Harvey and Dan have pulled themselves away.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm proposing a citywide ordinance.
          It ensures that a person who
          already has a job can't be fired
          for their orientation.

          DAN WHITE
          I'm not sure my constituents would
          favor that.
          Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.

          HARVEY MILK
          Is anyone else here from the Board?

          DAN WHITE
          You're the only one who showed up I
          think.

          HARVEY MILK
          Were you christened here?

          DAN WHITE
          Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My
          grandma immigrated here when this
          was an Irish Catholic city. The
          City of St. Francis... A lot's
          changed here since then.

          HARVEY MILK
          You're more like one of us now...
          an outsider.

          

          

          

          

          55.

          DAN WHITE
          You're not like most homosexuals,
          are you, Harvey?

          HARVEY MILK
          Do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"

          DAN WHITE
          (smiles, then)
          Say, where do you stand on the
          Psychiatric Center the City's been
          pushing into my district?

          HARVEY MILK
          Well, I'd have to study it...

          DAN WHITE
          Getting it out of my district was a
          key piece of my platform. It only
          attracts arsonist, rapists, all
          that, you know.

          HARVEY MILK
          Sure, sure. A campaign promise.

          DAN WHITE
          A big one.

          (QUIET)
          What do you say we watch out for each
          other's interests? I'd like that.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'd like that, too, Dan.
          Mary Ann White approaches with their child. It's awkward, as
          if she's walked in on something intimate.

          DAN WHITE
          I'm sorry. Slipped into some shop
          talk.

          HARVEY MILK
          The Gay Rights Ordinance. My fault.

          MARY ANN WHITE
          Seems an inappropriate subject in
          here don't you think?

          HARVEY MILK
          Hey, don't knock it till you've
          tried it.
          His attempt to break the tension goes down in flames. She
          cracks a polite smile. They're from very different worlds.

          

          

          

          

          56.

          88 INT. HARVEY'S CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY

          Harvey is under pressure from his own advisors (Michael,
          Dick, Cleve) to vote against Dan's bill.

          DICK PABICH
          Supervisors Silver and Lau are
          asking you to vote to keep this
          Psychiatric Center in Dan's
          district. It'll go down 6 to 5 if
          you vote to get rid of it.

          MICHAEL WONG
          It's a Youth Campus, Harvey. These
          are kids that would be displaced
          from their families if it's moved.

          HARVEY MILK
          I can't just dump Dan. The guy's
          got nothing going for him. No
          friends...

          CLEVE JONES
          Here we go, Harvey to the rescue.
          Isn't it enough we have to put up
          with Jack?

          HARVEY MILK
          Lay off. He registered 120 voters
          last week.

          CLEVE JONES
          So do any of your volunteers, but
          you don't make them all first lady.

          MICHAEL WONG
          What does Dan White do for you?
          Really? Politically?

          HARVEY MILK
          He intrigues me... I think he may
          be one of us.
          Everyone groans. Cleve camps it up:

          CLEVE JONES
          Dear God, say it ain't so!

          HARVEY MILK
          It's just a theory...

          DICK PABICH
          You just think he's cute.

          

          

          

          

          57.

          HARVEY MILK
          No... I know what it's like to
          live that life. That lie. You can
          see it in Dan's eyes... The fear,
          the pressure...
          Anne Kronenberg walks in. She's got that look in her eyes.
          Something's up.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Good or Bad?

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Not great. State Senator John
          Briggs is Anita Bryant's go-to guy
          in California for sure. He's filed
          his petition for a statewide
          referendum to fire all gay teachers
          and anyone who supports them.
          A pall falls over the room. This is worse than expected.

          HARVEY MILK
          How many signatures will he need to
          qualify for the ballot?

          CLEVE JONES
          Whatever. He can get them in two
          Sundays at church in Orange County.

          HARVEY MILK
          (instead of fear,
          excitement bubbles up)
          This means the fight's coming here,
          where we can do something about it!
          Wichita's one thing, Kansas City.
          But Anita's heading for San
          Francisco! She's not going to know
          what hit her. Smile, children! This
          is the fight we've been waiting for.

          89 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL STEPS - DAY

          CA State Senator, JOHN BRIGGS, 47, delivers his message to
          the PRESS, THE TV CREWS, AND A MASS OF PROTESTERS.
          HARVEY AND HIS GROUP are amongst the crowd.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          My proposition promises to protect
          our children from these gay
          perverts and pedophiles who recruit
          our children to their deviant
          lifestyles, including the ones who

          JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D)
          do it in our public schools. It's
          time to root them out.
          In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful, worked up:

          TOM AMMIANO
          And how are you going to determine
          who's a homosexual?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Sir, my bill outlines procedures
          for identifying homosexuals.

          ANOTHER PROTESTER
          How? Will you be sucking them off?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Sir, you can argue with me, but you
          cannot argue with God.
          It's getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by TWO
          OFFICERS. He trips off the curb and is quickly scooped up.

          90 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME - DAY

          Dan's house is filled with RELATIVES for a birthday
          celebration. Dan is glued to the NEWS, watching BRIGGS.
          Dan's RELATIVES gather around the TV. Mary Ann puts their
          BABY into Dan's arms and returns to wrangling kids.

          THE COVERAGE CUTS TO HARVEY BEING INTERVIEWED:

          HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
          Look what happened in Germany. Now
          Anita Bryant already says that Jews
          and Muslims are going to hell, you
          know she's got a shopping list. We
          are not going to let John Briggs or
          Anita Bryant legislate bigotry in
          this city...
          Hold on Dan watching Harvey on TV.

          90B INT. UPSCALE SF HOUSE - NIGHT

          Cleve and Anne sit in the entry way, Cleve in his tight jeans
          and shirt. He's very out of place amongst all the suits.
          Harvey walks in. Cleve and Anne rush to his side. David
          Goodstein and Rick Stokes turn to greet Milk.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          Hello, Harvey. Running late?
          (Harvey doesn't stop)

          DAVID GOODSTEIN (CONT'D)
          Oh Harvey... your boyfriend is in
          the closet.

          HARVEY MILK
          Excuse me, David?

          RICK STOKES

          (QUIETLY)
          The Latino, he's locked himself in
          the coat room... Mr. Milk, Phil
          Burton is here. He's likely the
          next Speaker of the House and a
          much needed ally against Prop Six.
          We don't need a scene.

          90C INT. UPSCALE S.F. HOUSE / COAT ROOM DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Harvey is at the door. Jack is locked inside the room.

           HARVEY MILK
          You're right, I know, I was late by
          twenty minutes. I'm sorry, Jack.

          JACK LIRA (O.S.)
          Who were you with? Scott? Some boy?

          HARVEY MILK
          I was at work. Come out, sugar pea.

          JACK LIRA (O.S.)
          No. You embarrassed me. I didn't
          know anyone. These are not good
          people. I don't want to be here.

          HARVEY MILK
          Then go home, Jack.

          JACK LIRA (O.S.)
          No. I'll wait for you. Go away.
          A tight smile from Harvey as he looks up to Cleve.

          91 INT. UPSCALE S.F. HOUSE / STUDY - LATER

          Harvey, Cleve and a dozen others are scattered about the room
          for a meeting with the DEMOCRATIC PARTY ESTABLISHMENT. U.S.
          Congressman PHIL BURTON, 51, leans on a desk, listening.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          The Briggs initiative is polling at
          75 percent for approval statewide.

          CLEVE JONES
          80 percent in other polls. Some
          even have us losing San Francisco.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          (condescending to Cleve)
          So it's important we not deceive
          people into thinking we can beat
          this, or we'll have riots and only
          increase this backlash.

          HARVEY JONES
          Good point, David. Let's just roll
          right over. Make it easier for
          Briggs to fuck us up the ass.
          Rick and David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it,
          passing out copies of his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier.

          PHIL BURTON
          We're taking this very seriously in
          my office. We want to send one of
          these to every home in California.
          We'll need money to do that.

          HARVEY MILK
          (reading the flier)
          "Proposition Six is an affront to
          Human Rights. An invasion of the
          State into the private lives of
          California citizens."
          (points to the pictures)
          Does it even say the word gay on
          this thing? Anywhere?

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          No Harvey, purposefully not.

          PHIL BURTON
          With the heat bearing down on your
          movement right now, we think it's
          best to dodge the "gay" bullet. Go
          for the human rights angle.

          HARVEY MILK
          People need to know who's affected.
          This flier needs at least one old
          queen on it.
          (a dig, to Goodstein)
          Why don't you volunteer for that,
          David?

          RICK STOKES
          (an olive branch)
          Corey Wares is an out gay--

          

          

          

          

          61.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          (cutting Rick him off)

          RICK--

          HARVEY MILK
          This is shit. Shit and
          masturbation. It's a coward's
          response to a dangerous threat.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          (a beat, then)
          I think you should leave.
          In the face of Phil Burton, most the others seem to agree.
          HARVEY PUTS PHIL BURTON'S FLYER IN THE FIREPLACE on his way
          out of the room.

          91B INT. UPSCALE SF HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Harvey knocks on the coat check door.

          HARVEY MILK
          Jack, it's time to go.
          (to Cleve)
          Get everyone together. I want young
          people, women, fresh heads.
          Fighters and organizers, not
          politicians.

          CLEVE JONES
          (as if Jack can't spell)
          What about, S-C-O-T-T?
          OFF HARVEY, knowing Scott would be an asset. Jack opens the
          door and grabs Harvey's hand. They go.

          92 INT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Harvey's clan is assembled (Jim, Dick, Mike, Cleve, Anne,
          Jack, Denis) along with fiery teacher Tom Amiano and MANY

          OTHER YOUNG ACTIVISTS.
          A HANDSOME PIZZA DELIVERY GUY is setting down boxes of
          pizzas. They're in for the night. The atmosphere is 180
          degrees different from the previous stuffy meeting.

          CLEVE JONES
          We're not interested in working
          with those old Democratic Party
          shits.
          THE DOOR OPENS and someone new enters. He's HOLDING THE HAND
          OF... SCOTT SMITH. They are obviously a new couple.

          

          

          

          

          62.
          Scott and his BOYFRIEND find a place on the floor. Harvey's
          and Scott's EYES MEET across the room.

          JIM RIVALDO
          But we can't afford infighting
          anymore, Cleve. We have to bring
          together every group. Even the old
          school Democrats.

          HARVEY MILK
          (taking over)
          Is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy,
          or are we just gonna stare?
          People start chipping in for the HANDSOME PIZZA GUY.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          If we're gonna convince the 90% to
          give a shit about us 10%... We
          have to let 'em know who we are.
          (his big new idea)
          Everybody's coming out. The entire
          state. No matter where they live.

          DICK PABICH
          "Come out, come out, wherever you
          are!"

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm serious.
          (beat, the room gets quiet)
          We're going to tell everyone in the
          state to come out. Every gay doctor,
          lawyer, teacher, dog catcher... We
          have to leave the ghetto, let all
          those people out there know that
          they do know one of us. And if
          people won't step out of the closet,
          we open the door for them.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Jesus.

          SCOTT SMITH
          The whole state is not San Francisco.

          HARVEY MILK
          Clearly, Scott.

          JIM RIVALDO
          It could be dangerous. There is
          such a thing as a right to privacy.

          

          

          

          

          63.

          HARVEY MILK
          Privacy's our enemy. You want real
          political power? Let's tell the
          truth for a change. Starting here.
          If there's anybody in this room,
          right now, who hasn't told their
          families, their friends, their
          employers... Do it. Now.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          My folks know already.
          A beat. The room is silent. Dick looks ill.

          DICK PABICH
          I haven't told my father yet...

          HARVEY MILK
          (a beat, then)
          People vote two to one for us if
          they know just one of us.

          (BEAT)
          Cleve, show Dick where you keep
          your phone.

          CLEVE JONES
          It's in the bedroom.
          After a moment, Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room.
          People are stunned by Harvey's outrageous demand. Harvey sees
          Scott GLARING at him.

          93 EXT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT / STAIRCASE - LATER

          The meeting is breaking up, and Scott lets his NEW BOYFRIEND
          go ahead. Harvey ducks away from Jack and intercepts Scott.

          HARVEY MILK
          I thought you were done with
          politics.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Politics. Not the movement. What
          the hell was that in there?

          HARVEY MILK
          The movement needs people to be up-
          front. Why were you fighting me?

          SCOTT SMITH
          You were the biggest closet case
          alive in New York. You told me and
          all your boyfriends to keep our

          My parents are gone. My brother
          knows. I'm sure they knew.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I had to listen to your phone calls
          home to Mom. Hear you deny that I
          existed. You want to be "normal" as
          bad as any of us. More than any of
          us... Those are kids in there.
          You're asking them to lose their
          families.

          HARVEY MILK
          If their families won't love them
          for who they are, who they really
          are, then they should lose them.

          SCOTT SMITH
          That's fucking insane.

          HARVEY MILK
          (re: Scott's new Boyfriend)
          Who's he? Do you live together?

          SCOTT SMITH
          Someone I'm seeing. He's good for
          me. He makes me stay home at
          nights, out of the bars...

          HARVEY MILK
          (quietly, so Jack doesn't hear)
          I miss you.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Oh, Harvey, don't...
          (eyeing Jack down the street)
          What's that about?

          JACK LIRA
          (calling out)
          Har-veyyyyy!

          HARVEY MILK
          He needs me.
          Scott nods. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARVEY'S ACHILLES HEAL.
          He walks away from Harvey, leaving him alone.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          94 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - DAY

           Dianne bangs her gavel like a mad woman. Harvey's adamant.

          HARVEY MILK DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          I have told no lies here Supervisor Milk, you will
          today or to Supervisor White come to order.
          in the past--

           HARVEY MILK
          --I want it noted that I never
          promised to back moving any Mental
          Health Centers. I greatly respect
          Supervisor White, but I would like
          his remarks stricken.

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          Duly noted. We will take a recess
          before recording the vote.
          Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans over to Harvey.

          CAROL RUTH SILVER
          Thank you, Harvey.
          Harvey is preoccupied with Dan approaching. He leans back.

          DAN WHITE
          Can I have a moment with Harvey?
          Alone, please, Carol?
          She politely recognizes the tension and gets up.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          Why are you turning on me like this
          at the last minute? What did I do?

          HARVEY MILK
          I didn't have all the details. I'll
          help you craft a different version
          that doesn't displace any kids.

          DAN WHITE
          Harvey, I can't go back to my family
          and to my folks and to my district
          without this. Don't do this.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm getting a lot of pressure, Dan.

          DAN WHITE
          You strung me along. And now you're
          throwing me to the wolves.

          

          

          

          

          66.

          HARVEY MILK
          You only need one more vote, Dan.
          There are 5 other Supervisors you
          could convince besides me.
          Dan grabs Harvey. It's threatening. A new side of Dan.

          DAN WHITE
          I'll vote against your Queer Law.
          I'll get Quentin against it.

          HARVEY MILK
          It'll still pass. You can't keep
          alienating yourself here, Dan.

          DAN WHITE
          I gave you a chance, Harvey. I
          really did. You blew it. You really
          blew it.
          Dan goes, the rage of a scorned adolescent under his suit.

          94A INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          Harvey's mood has darkened as he talks into his recorder...

          HARVEY MILK
          Across the country, a handful of
          city councils had passed the very
          first ordinances protecting gay
          people against discrimination. But
          Anita Bryant and her right wing
          Christian fundamentalists were
          creating and exploiting and fanning
          a backlash. Now she had referenda
          to repeal all of these gay rights
          ordinances. While we were preparing
          for the battle against Briggs and
          Prop Six, Anita Bryant was taking
          her show on the road... sweeping
          the country. Her next stop was
          Wichita, Kansas.

          95 INT. TV NEWS REPORTS - NIGHT

          CHYRON: "Landslide: Wichita says NO to Gays." Anita talks to
          a REPORTER. BRIGGS is among the supporters at her side.

          ANITA BRYANT
          I give thanks for all of our foot
          soldiers of God here in Wichita.
          But we must push on. Look what
          happened to Sodom and to the world
          of Noah. Onward Christian soldiers!

          On to California!

          96 I/E. TELEPHONE TREE MONTAGE / EFFECT - DAY
          A telephone tree MONTAGE starts with Cleve on a PAY PHONE on
          Castro Street:

          CLEVE JONES
          Hi. We're losing Wichita. Rally
          tonight. Sundown. Market and Castro.
          A MULTIPLYING FRAME EFFECT: the person he called calls two
          others, they call four, then more and more as the tree grows.

          98 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

          HARVEY'S POV ON: The VIOLENT DEATH THREAT LETTER AND DRAWING
          that is still tacked up to his refrigerator.
          OUTSIDE: The SOUNDS of a RIOT in the making.
          Harvey rips down the threatening LETTER and throws it away.

          99 INT. CAMERA SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          Harvey BOUNDS down the stairs and into the shop. Cleve RUSHES
          into the store, breathless.

          CLEVE JONES
          They're moving. I don't know
          where, but...

          HARVEY MILK
          Did Jim call the press?
          (shouting at Danny)
          Get out there with your camera!

          DANNY NICCOLETTA
          I'm going!

          CLEVE JONES
          Press is covered. But we don't have
          a permit to march.

          HARVEY MILK
          (digs for his bullhorn)
          When I got Coors out of the bars,
          the Union gave me this. I want you
          to have it.

          CLEVE JONES
          What do I do with this?

          

          

          

          

          68.

          HARVEY MILK
          You're an activist. Take it. March
          them.
          (off Cleve, unsure)
          March those people up to the front
          doors of City Hall. When it looks
          really bad, the city's first gay
          Supervisor will come out and play
          peacemaker. We save the city from a
          riot. We can turn this night into
          more political power for the cause.

          CLEVE JONES
          I can't do it like you do it.

          HARVEY MILK
          I won't always be here. Somebody
          else will have to take over.
          (looking him in the eye)
          I need you to be the scary one now.

          100 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - NIGHT

          A massive, angry crowd has gathered. Baby-faced Cleve takes a
          makeshift stage. He lifts the bullhorn and with nerves, reads
          a speech. Its pages blow about.
          CLEVE'S POV: Harvey watches from afar. Encouraging him.

          CLEVE JONES
          Forty years ago tonight, the gay
          citizens of Germany found out they
          no longer had civil rights.
          Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens
          of Wichita will also awaken to find
          that they too have lost their civil
          rights. You have whistles. You use
          them when we have been attacked.
          Tonight we have been attacked.
          Initially Cleve is successful, but then the crowd turns,
          marching toward City Hall without him.

          CLEVE JONES(CONT'D)
          Fuck. Shit. Harvey!
          Cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd, to get
          to the front. He gets on his walkie-talkie.

          CLEVE JONES (CONT'D)
          Get the press to the overpass!
          ON HARVEY: Ducking through EMPTY STREETS, trying to get AHEAD
          OF THE CROWD and beat them to City Hall.

          

          

          

          

          69.
          Cleve gets to the head of the crowd.

          CLEVE JONES (CONT'D)
          Move... Left... Move... Left...

          JIM RIVALDO
          (charging up)
          What are you doing? Where's Harvey?

          CLEVE JONES
          We're shutting down traffic, both
          directions.
          Cleve looks up at the press that's arrived on the overpass
          above, and turns to two HIPPIE KIDS near the front.

          CLEVE JONES(CONT'D)
          Disconnect the power arms!
          The boys climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms.
          Sparks fly. Brakes squeal. The press snaps photos.

          100B INT. CASTRO STREET BAR - NIGHT

          The angry protesters march past the large glass windows of
          TWIN PEAKS bar. Unlike the Dade County march, the bar is
          empty. The patrons are already in the streets.

          101 INT. CITY HALL - LATER

          Harvey RACES to his office. He stops at a mirror to
          straighten his tie and collect himself.
          OUTSIDE: The SOUND of the ANGRY MOB on City Hall's front
          steps. "Civil Rights or Civil War!" Someone THROWS A ROCK at
          the City Hall doors.
          Harvey rushes out the front doors, pushing past the police to
          greet THE MOB on City Hall's front steps. Through the glass
          doors we see Cleve rush up and hand Harvey his bullhorn:

          HARVEY MILK
          Hello. My name is Harvey Milk, and
          I want to recruit you.
          (AN ENORMOUS CHEER rises)
          I want to recruit you for the fight
          to preserve our democracy against
          the Anita Bryants and John Briggs
          who are trying to legalize bigotry!
          We have a choice to make. The fight
          is at our doors. We must either go
          back in the closet and shut it
          tight, or fight... History shows

          that if we continue to fight, we...
          will... win.

          101B INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Jim, Dick, Anne, Michael, Frank and Cleve are all in the
          office. The FRONT PAGE of the Examiner features a PICTURE OF
          CLEVE AND HARVEY ARM IN ARM on City Hall's steps. Cleve is
          jazzed. Harvey stews.

          CLEVE JONES
          They're calling it a "successful
          mediation." You're a God damn hero.
          Fuck. It came this close to a riot.

          HARVEY
          Lose the note cards next time. Your
          job is just to say into that
          bullhorn what they're all feeling.

          CLEVE JONES
          You're just jealous it wasn't you
          out there.

          HARVEY MILK
          We're losing Prop Six by 60% and
          you're over there celebrating a
          riot. I need more visibility...
          (the real problem:)
          If we're going to beat this thing,
          we have to get Briggs to
          acknowledge us.
          Harvey steps away, hot, pensive. Anne gets quiet.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Every paper's calling Prop Six the
          main event now. We lose this, we'll
          have anti-gay laws in all fifty
          states, and Briggs won't return our
          calls for a public debate.

          DICK PABICH
          He's ignoring us to death.

          HARVEY MILK
          (steaming back in)
          We need something populist. What's
          the number one complaint about city
          life?

          CLEVE JONES
          The piss smell in the Tenderloin.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          HARVEY MILK
          Close.

          FRANK ROBINSON
          Dog shit.

          JIM RIVALDO
          If you cleaned up all the dog shit
          in the city, you could be elected
          Mayor.

          CLEVE JONES
          "Mayor Milk."

          HARVEY MILK
          I like it.

          104 EXT. SF SIDEWALKS - DAY

          Cleve searches frantically for something... He SEES a pile of
          DOG POOP. He scoops it up and runs it back to City Hall's
          front lawn and plants it in the grass.

          105 EXT. CITY HALL / FRONT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

          IN THE VERY SAME SPOT CLEVE JUST WAS: Harvey with a clump of
          REPORTERS, a red and white "No on 6" button pinned to his
          lapel (HENCEFORTH, IT'S A FIXTURE).

          HARVEY MILK
          Dog mess is a hazard, and on top of
          that, it's disgusting. Under the
          ordinance, dog owners that don't
          clean up can be fined. This really
          is the bottom line!
          He smiles at his own joke, punctuating it by "accidentally"
          stepping in Cleve's well-placed dog shit. A BIG grin. BULBS
          FLASH. These flashes transition into:

          106 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - DAY

          HARVEY STUDIES HIS OWN PHOTO on the FRONT PAGE of the
          Chronicle, making his announcement about dog poop.
          The SUPERVISORS are assembled for a vote. The CLERK, 60,
          wraps up his roll call

          CLERK
          Supervisor Lau?

          GORDON LAU
          Aye.

          DAN WHITE
          No.

          CLERK
          White, No. Madam President, I have
          ten ayes and one no.
          Dianne Feinstein BANGS HER GAVEL down hard.

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          The San Francisco Gay Rights
          Ordinance sponsored by Supervisors
          Milk and Silver is passed.

          CAMERA'S FLASH! THE PACKED CHAMBERS ROAR!
          Harvey locks onto Dan White. Dan makes eye contact. Harvey
          turns his attention to the chamber audience's applause.

          107 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

          A gaggle of press has congregated. Mayor Moscone and Harvey
          walk into the office keeping their conversation private.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          I can't get my stories on page ten,
          you're getting page one?

          HARVEY MILK
          Doggy-doo's a real problem, George.
          With a shit eating grin, Harvey offers up a powder blue pen.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Powder blue to sign they city's
          first Gay Rights law... George, we
          need your help with Briggs... The
          gay community will have your back
          from now on. On all issues. I hope
          you'll have ours.
          A beat between them. An alliance is forming. The Mayor sits
          behind his desk and turns to the press with Harvey's pen.

          

          

          

          

          73.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          Good morning, everyone... I don't
          do this enough, taking swift and
          unambiguous action on a substantive
          move for civil rights.
          Moscone signs the law with the powder blue pen. Harvey leans
          over him. THE PRESS CAPTURES THE MOMENT.

          107A INT. DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - DAY

          Dan sits at his desk, agitated. DAN'S POV: The FRONT PAGE of
          the Examiner featuring MOSCONE AND HARVEY.
          Harvey comes to the door.

          HARVEY MILK
          What are you working on, Dan?

          DAN WHITE
          If you have something to discuss,
          you can have your aide make an
          appointment with my aide.

          HARVEY MILK
          Listen, I know you're disappointed
          about the Psychiatric Center...
          What else do you have coming up?

          DAN WHITE
          Now you need something from me.
          You want my me to join in with the
          Queers on this Prop Six business?

          HARVEY MILK
          We prefer the word "gay," Dan.
          Just as I'm sure you prefer the
          word, "Irish-American" to "Mick."

          DAN WHITE
          Harvey, our society can't exist
          without the family, without the
          church.

          HARVEY MILK
          We're not against those things.

          DAN WHITE
          You're not? Can two men reproduce?

          HARVEY MILK
          (a smile)
          No. But, we keep trying!

          and Briggs... we can work together.
          On something...

          DAN WHITE
          Okay. You introduce an initiative
          for Supervisor pay raises.

          HARVEY MILK
          (anything but that)
          It's a bad time politically. I have
          an election next year.

          DAN WHITE
          You asked for something. Introduce
          pay raises. I can't take care of
          my family on our salaries. You
          don't have that problem, do you?
          Dan's AIDE steps into the doorway. She seems surprised to see
          Harvey in Dan's office.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          Mr. Milk, You'll excuse me, I have
          a development meeting.
          Dan goes.

          108 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - NIGHT

          A crowd sings âHappy Birthday.â One after another, Harvey's
          guests throw CREAM PIES in his face. RICK AND DAVID GOODSTEIN
          INCLUDED. A PEACE OFFERING. Harvey wipes pie from his eyes.
          In the B.G. the black drag queen sensation, SYLVESTER, breaks
          into his top 10 anthem, "You Make Me Feel." It's a who's who
          of San Francisco's political elite. Jack scoots up to Harvey.

          HARVEY MILK
          What's wrong, Taco Bell?

          JACK LIRA
          Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of
          your table. You should fire them.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'll take it under consideration.
          Why don't you get us a drink?
          A kiss and Jack heads to the bar. Scott approaches.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Don't let Cezar Chavez hear you
          calling him Taco Bell.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          HARVEY MILK
          He's getting better. He's enrolling
          in classes on Monday.
          Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey's jacket.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I remember when your birthdays were
          a bit less... lavish. More
          intimate.

          HARVEY MILK
          Who invited you? Anne?

          SCOTT SMITH
          My boyfriend got an invitation. I
          was his "plus one."

          HARVEY MILK
          Congratulations. It was a tough
          ticket to get.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Congratulations to you. Looks like
          you're part of the Machine now.
          (Harvey looks away, toward Jack)
          You can do better.

          HARVEY MILK
          When I come home to Jack, I don't
          have to talk politics or talk
          intelligently. Or even talk.

          (SELF-DEPRECATING)
          And where's an old man like me
          going to get such a good looking
          young man, right?

          SCOTT SMITH
          You're not so old. You look
          handsome... Happy 48th. Looks like
          you're gonna make it to fifty after-
          all, Mr. Milk.
          Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS.

          109 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Harvey, still wearing cream pie remnants on his jacket, waits
          for Jack to come out of the rest room. Harvey's one of the
          last guests to leave. WAITERS are clearing tables.

          HARVEY'S POV DOWN A DIMLY LIT CORRIDOR: A MALE FIGURE
          APPROACHES, footsteps ECHOING on the marble floor. Harvey
          braces himself.

          

          

          

          

          76.
          Emerging from the shadows: DAN WHITE. He approaches Harvey
          with a bottle of Chivas.
          Dan is SUPER-FRIENDLY, as if nothing unpleasant has ever
          happened between them.

          DAN WHITE
          Sorry I missed the party, Harv...

          HARVEY MILK
          No problem, Dan. Good to see you.

          DAN WHITE
          Dog poop?

          HARVEY MILK
          Yeah.

          DAN WHITE
          It's good! It's a good one.

          HARVEY MILK
          Thanks. But it's a real problem.

          DAN WHITE
          Oh, yeah. I mean, God knows how many
          problems it causes. All kinds of
          diseases, birth defects probably, I
          mean, stuff you can't even...
          (drifting off, drunkenly)
          Hey, I got you a little something.

          HARVEY MILK
          You didn't have to--

          DAN WHITE
          (at the same time)
          You didn't have to--

          (LAUGHING)
          Why do people always say that?
          "You didn't have to?" I mean, of
          course, right? But, that's what
          they always say. They always say
          things like that...
          Dan's attempts to be witty and erudite (like Harvey) only
          leave him confused and tongue tied.
          Harvey HAS NO IDEA why Dan is here.

          HARVEY MILK
          Are you okay, Dan?

          

          

          

          

          77.

          DAN WHITE
          Oh, what? Yeah, sure. Harvey, I
          just... I just want to say...
          Happy Birthday.
          Dan PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HARVEY for a sort-of macho but
          really weird birthday hug. Harvey stiffens, it's such a
          peculiar moment. Dan steps back, looks him over.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          I've really learned a lot from
          watching you, Harvey.

          HARVEY MILK
          I doubt that.

          DAN WHITE
          No, I have. You gotta get out
          there. Get noticed. That's how it
          works. But, you have an issue.
          That's your advantage.

          HARVEY MILK
          It's more than an issue, Dan.
          (a beat, one last try to
          get through to him)
          Dan. I've had four relationships in
          my life. Three of those four tried
          to kill themselves. I know it was
          my fault they did it. I told them
          to stay quiet. To hide. Most of my
          life I've been closeted. That's
          what living this life is like for
          most of us. The way things are...
          This isn't just about our jobs, or
          any issue, it's our lives we're
          fighting for.
          Jack emerges from the bathroom, barely together and leans on
          Harvey. Dan steps back from Harvey and Jack, his moment
          alone stolen away.

          DAN WHITE
          I've learned a lot from you,
          Harvey. I'm going to get my picture
          in the papers, too. You'll see.
          I've got my own issue. That's
          right. Dan White's Got An Issue!

          110 EXT. GAY FREEDOM DAY PARADE - DAY

          STOCK FOOTAGE: Along Market street: 375,000 people have shown
          up for the parade, many holding signs naming their hometowns:
          Newark, San Antonio, Lincoln.

          

          

          

          

          78.
          A MONTAGE: of the various marchers, floats, "Parents and
          Friends Of", high-camp drag queens, etc.
          Harvey sits on top of a car with a pink lei around his neck,
          a fistful of white flowers in one hand, and in the other, a
          hand written sign: "I'm from Woodmere, NY." To a news camera:

          HARVEY MILK
          Come out! Just come on out!
          DRIVING THE CAR: Anne keeps a close eye on the parade
          watchers. Any one of them could be an assassin.

          111 ON A STREET CORNER - DAN WHITE IS WITH A REPORTER:

          DAN WHITE
          I see naked men walking around,
          naked women walking around, which
          doesn't bother me as far as my
          personal standards of nudity, but
          it's not proper. We wouldn't allow
          it for any other parade in San
          Francisco, and it should not be
          allowed for the gay parade.

          112 EXT. GAY FREEDOM DAY PARADE / STAGE - LATER

           Just off stage. Anne hands him a typed postcard.

           ANNE KRONENBERG
          It came in the mail today.

          HARVEY MILK
          "You get the first bullet the minute
          you stand at the microphone."
          (looking for a silver lining)
          Looks like the publicity's working.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          You don't have to go up there.

          HARVEY MILK
          It could happen any day, any night,
          any time...
          (off the ROARING CROWD
          that's waiting for him)
          The nation's eye is on us. I have
          to do this.
          JUMP TO: POV shots of cops and loners amongst the massive
          audience hint at Harvey's paranoia.
          Like diving off a cliff, Harvey launches up to the
          microphone. The deafening cheers surely would have drowned

          

          

          

          

          79.
          out gunfire, but when it fades, He's standing. He delivers
          his impassioned call to action:

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          My name is Harvey Milk, and I want
          to recruit you. I want to recruit
          you for the fight to preserve your
          democracy. Brothers and sisters, you
          must come out. Come out to your
          parents. I know that it is hard and
          will hurt them but think about how
          they will hurt you in the voting
          booth! Come out to your friends, if
          they indeed are your friends. Come
          out to your neighbors, to your
          fellow workers. Once and for all,
          break down the myths, destroy the
          lies and distortions. For your sake.
          For their sake. For the sake of the
          youngsters who are becoming scared
          by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On
          the Statue of Liberty it says "Give
          me your tired, your poor, your
          huddled masses yearning to be free."
          In the Declaration of Independence
          it is written "All men are created
          equal and are endowed with certain
          inalienable rights." For Mr. Briggs
          and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots
          out there, no matter how hard you
          try, you cannot erase those words
          from the Declaration of
          Independence. No matter how hard you
          try, you cannot chip those words
          from off the base of the Statue of
          Liberty. That is what America is.
          Love it or leave it.
          Wild applause. He scans the crowd as he steps off stage. A
          bit surprised to still be alive. Cleve grabs him.

          CLEVE JONES
          The Mayor says Briggs is on his way
          here. He could intercept him for
          us. We could get him face to face.
          He couldn't ignore us anymore.

          HARVEY MILK
          Get the press.

          113 INT. LIMOUSINE / 5 BLOCKS FROM THE FREEDOM DAY PARADE - SAME

          John Briggs rides in a limo watching the âfreaks" outside. As
          he nears the Parade Stages his POLICE ESCORTS take an
          unplanned turn. He leans forward.

          

          

          

          

          80.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          The parade is the other direction.

          DRIVER
          They're taking us another way, Sir.

          114 INT. WAREHOUSE ON THE PIER - MOMENTS LATER

          The limo pulls in. Briggs cautiously steps out. Greeting him
          are Moscone, the POLICE CHIEF, 25 SFPD officers, a gaggle of
          press, and Harvey Milk.
          It's a showdown... HIGH NOON.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          I'm afraid it's not in the interest
          of your safety, or my public's
          safety to let you into that parade
          grounds.
          Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for
          the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an
          honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to
          fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.

          HARVEY MILK
          No sir. I would love to have a
          public debate. I'm very interested
          in the details of your argument.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          You know the details. As do the
          people. Look at the votes across this
          nation. The "public" is with me.

          HARVEY MILK
          Yes sir, today they are. But with my
          City's Mayor and the San Francisco
          press as my witnesses, I'm
          challenging you to a public debate.
          John nods, stiff. He can no longer avoid Harvey Milk. He gets
          back in his limo.

          

          

          

          

          81.

          INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - (ON TV) 115

          Harvey sits with John Briggs at a table facing forward. We
          hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience.

          HARVEY MILK
          Senator, as a Christian it's
          interesting that you don't seem to
          understand what Christ was about.
          He was about accepting people and
          giving love, not carrying a Bible
          in one hand and hatred in the
          other...
          (cheers from the audience)
          ...Now all the gay myths have been
          shattered, all the fears, all the--

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Not in my mind they haven't--

          HARVEY MILK
          That's it. In your mind they
          haven't, and I'm wondering why--

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who
          believe in practicing bestiality to
          teach our children, and the reason
          we don't is because it is illegal.
          But it's not illegal to be a
          homosexual in California.

          HARVEY MILK
          And your law goes even further. Any
          school employee who even supports a
          gay person will be fired--

          JOHN BRIGGS
          True. But, gay people don't have
          children of their own. If they
          don't recruit our children, they'd
          all die away. That's why they want
          to be teachers, to encourage our
          children to join them.

          HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
          How do you teach homosexuality?
          Like French? I was born of
          heterosexual parents, I was taught
          by heterosexual teachers in a
          fiercely heterosexual society. So
          then why am I homosexual? And no
          offense meant, but if it were true
          that children mimicked their

          82.

          HARVEY MILK (ON TV) (CONT'D)
          teachers, you'd sure have a helluva
          lot more nuns running around.
          The audience eats it up. It feel like "The Harvey Milk Show."

          116 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

          Briggs makes a STATEMENT to the press.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          If they're going to lead such an
          open life of homosexuality that
          they want a 21-gun salute every
          time somebody goes by them, those
          people are going to be in danger of
          being removed their job.

          116B INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          Continuing on with his recorded will...

          HARVEY MILK
          We were really genuinely frightened
          by Proposition Six, and with the
          backlash gaining strength, we were
          very pessimistic. We didn't think
          there was any chance we could beat
          it. What we hoped to do was to
          organize to the point that when we
          did lose, there would be a
          revolt... That all hell would break
          lose.

          117 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Harvey, pacing, decisive.

          DICK PABICH
          People are coming out, though. We
          met with groups in Bakersfield,
          Redding, a dozen people showed up
          in a library basement in Fresno
          asking for our support if they came
          out. Last Sunday, the Reverend of
          St. Mary's came out to his entire
          congregation...

          HARVEY MILK
          We're still losing, 60 to 30. We
          have to take the show on the road.
          Call Briggs's office. Do a press
          release. Tell them he can pick the
          town, the audience, and I'll ask
          our supporters not to attend.

          

          

          

          

          83.

          DICK PABICH
          Their audiences are insanely
          devout. We'll get killed.

          HARVEY MILK
          Get me Orange County.

          118 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jack is FLIPPING OUT, storming around the place.

          JACK LIRA
          You just have to go down to LA and
          guess the right things on TV and
          they'll pay us... You have to use
          your fame now while you have it. We
          could have nice things.

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't have time to do game shows
          right now...
          This stops Jack cold.

          JACK LIRA
          You are horrible! I have worked on
          this surprise for you for weeks!

          HARVEY MILK
          Are you drunk right now?

          JACK LIRA
          You are an ungrateful asshole!

          HARVEY MILK
          Jack, I'll have more time soon.

          JACK LIRA
          You're ashamed of me!

          HARVEY MILK
          That's not true. I think you're
          smart. You're capable. No matter
          what your family or your father
          said. I believe in you... We
          should figure out something for you
          to do. I could get you a job.

          JACK LIRA
          I'll never be good enough for you!
          Jack THROWS A PIECE OF POTTERY AT HARVEY. It misses, CRASHING
          THROUGH THE WINDOW onto the street below.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'll get a broom.
          Harvey goes. Jack collapses into a chair.

          119 INT. AUDITORIUM IN ORANGE COUNTY - NIGHT

          TV CAMERAS ROLL. They've gotten their ORANGE COUNTY DEBATE!
          BRIGGS'S SUPPORTERS jeer Harvey as he rips into their State
          Senator. Their vehemence frightens Dick in the audience.
          Harvey lifts a Briggs flier.

          HARVEY MILK
          If in your statements here you say
          that child molestation is not an
          issue, why do you put out literature
          that hammers it home, why do you play
          on that myth and fear?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Same thing with VD Harvey, we put
          out publications about VD so you
          can avoid it.

          HARVEY MILK
          (with a grin)
          But you've even admitted that
          there's more molestation in the
          heterosexual group! So why not get
          rid of the heterosexual teachers?
          Boos from the conservative audience.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          We are not talking about homos...
          child molestation, the fact is, at
          least 95 percent of the people are
          heterosexual. If we took
          heterosexuals out AND homosexuals
          out, you know what--

          JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) HARVEY MILK
          --we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers--

          HARVEY MILK
          --No child molestation... So you're
          saying the percentage of population
          is equal to the percentage of child
          molestation?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          (getting more lost)
          No, no, I'm not saying that at all--

          

          

          

          

          85.

          HARVEY MILK
          That's what you just said.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          No. I'm saying that we cannot
          prevent child molestation so let's
          cut our odds down and take out the
          homosexual group and keep in the
          heterosexual group--
          Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument. Briggs
          looks down to his notes, lost. Harvey takes the opportunity
          to rip into the State Senator:

          HARVEY MILK
          (directly to Briggs)
          --Sir, in your own drive for
          personal power, how many careers
          are you willing to see destroyed?
          How many lives will you destroy in
          your lust for power, and when will
          you stop?
          The crowd boos, rails. This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange
          County. In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by
          the level of hatred. Harvey tries to maintain his composure.

          120 EXT. CASTRO STREET - NIGHT

          Harvey heads home from work. He starts into his store.
          He sees JACK LIRA'S SHADOW through the curtains upstairs, and
          turns instead to the cafe next door.

          121 INT. CASTRO CAFE - NIGHT

          Harvey sits down at the bar. The WAITER pours a coffee for
          him. Harvey looks up to the TV.
          HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter. It
          feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey.

          DAN WHITE
          All I'm really saying is, if we
          don't protect ourselves with this
          kind of legislation, a transvestite
          can show up at a public school with
          all the qualifications for teaching
          and they can't refuse to hire him.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          122 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Harvey rushes from a packed session in the Supervisors'
          Chambers to his office. Anne is behind him. He picks up the
          phone. It seems urgent.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hey Jack, what's wrong?

          123 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT


          JACK LIRA
          Nothing. I just want to know when
          you'll be home.

          HARVEY MILK
          You just had them pull me out of my
          big vote on the dog shit ordinance.
          Did you do this on purpose, Jack?

          JACK LIRA
          It's poop, Harvey. Aren't I more
          important than poop?

          HARVEY MILK
          Yes, but... I don't know when I'll
          be home. Maybe 6. 6:15.

          JACK LIRA
          Fine. 6:15.
          Harvey hangs up. His patience is slipping. He looks up in
          time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase.

          124 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS HALLWAY - DAY

          Harvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out.

          HARVEY MILK
          Dan? How's the baby?

          DAN WHITE
          You didn't bring up Supervisor pay
          raises. In fact, I heard you plan
          to publicly oppose them.

          HARVEY MILK
          I heard you planned to vote against
          them too, Dan. Were you trying to
          set me up?

          DAN WHITE
          (parrotting Harvey

          EARLIER)

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          87.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          It's not a good time for me to
          bring it up. Politically.

          HARVEY MILK
          Dan, there's a vote to approve the
          police desegregation settlement,
          give me that and I'll consider
          backing pay raises.

          DAN WHITE
          (suddenly very dark)
          I don't trade votes... unlike you,
          the way I was raised, we believe in
          right and wrong. Moral and immoral.

          HARVEY MILK
          Black skin and White in your police
          department?
          (Dan steams)
          Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out
          against Proposition Six. You're
          looking more and more out of touch.

          DAN WHITE
          If I come out against Prop Six,
          it's only for the invasion of
          State's rights issue.

          HARVEY MILK
          (smiles, trying to lighten)
          And the potential witch hunts
          against you "straight people,"
          right?
          Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response. He can't.
          His behavior is alarming. He sets down his briefcase.

          DAN WHITE
          You underestimate me, Milk. You're
          very, very wrong about me.

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't know what you mean.
          A moment. Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          What is it, Dan? You can tell me.

          DAN WHITE
          You don't... You can't humiliate
          me. And you will not demean me.

          

          

          

          

          88.
          Anne appears down the hall. Dan has more on his mind, but the
          moment has passed. He picks up his briefcase and walks out of
          the building. Off Harvey, concerned.

          125 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER

          Harvey walks home. A PASSERBY shouts:

          PASSERBY
          You're the asshole that just passed
          that dog shit thing aren't you? What
          the hell do you have against dogs?

          HARVEY MILK
          (with his trademark charm)
          Sir, blind people can't see "shit."
          What the heck do you have against
          blind people?
          The young folks surrounding the PASSERBY laugh and hoot at
          Harvey's joke. Even the harassing PASSERBY can't help but
          crack a grin. Harvey beams.

          126 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Opening the door, Harvey finds a trail of voter registration
          cards, anti-Briggs literature, and Coors beer cans. Pushing
          through his fear, he carefully follows the cans and flyers up
          the stairs and through his apartment.
          Odd notes are taped to the walls. They all lead to a black
          velvet curtain with a note attached: "YOU'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE

          CIRCUS, HARVEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY LAST ACT?"
          Harvey pulls back the curtain to find Jack's body, cold and
          discolored, hanging from a beam by a noose.
          HARVEY CAN'T MOVE. He is mesmerized... horrified.
          He grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting Jack down. He
          cuts through the rope and FALLS TO THE FLOOR with the HEAVY

          BODY.

          127 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Scott arrives. Sitting very still, Harvey is being consoled
          by Cleve and Anne. Tears in his eyes, Harvey won't look up.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey. Look at me. Look at me. You
          did everything you could.

          HARVEY
          No, I didn't. Not everything...

          

          

          

          

          89.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What else could you have done?

          HARVEY
          I could have come home at six
          o'clock, not six-fifteen.
          Scott puts his arm around Harvey. Harvey buries his head.
          Anne helps Cleve take down Jack's many hidden notes. Cleve
          quietly reads a prominently placed one:

          CLEVE JONES
          "Beware. The ides. Of November."

          127A INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          Into the recorder as if re-living the event over again...

          HARVEY MILK
          Jack was gone. I didn't have time
          to mourn... There was no choice but
          to keep on... to keep fighting.

          128 INT. BARNUM AND BAILEY CIRCUS / MAKE UP ROOM / S.F. - DAY

          Harvey sits in a make-up chair. A MAKE-UP artist is painting
          him up to look like a clown. Several other CITY OFFICIALS are
          in chairs beyond him. Harvey turns to the make-up artist.
          With sincere enthusiasm:

          HARVEY MILK
          Thank you for this great honor. But
          do you think once the magazine is
          done snapping pictures, maybe I
          could keep the suit for a while?

          129 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

          Still made up from head to toe as a clown, Harvey walks the
          streets of San Francisco. He waves, smiles, poses for photos
          with tourists. It's a rare moment of grace. He jumps on a
          trolley headed toward Castro. He instantly captures the
          imagination of a small GIRL wearing a knit hat.

          HARVEY MILK
          (re: their hats)
          Would you like to trade with me?

          GIRL
          No. What the heck are you?

          HARVEY MILK
          Oh, me? I'm an elected official. I
          run this city.

          

          

          

          

          90.
          He makes a show of it. She smiles. He hands her the flower
          he's been holding onto all afternoon.

          130 INT. "NO ON SIX" CENTER / MARKET STREET - NIGHT

          THIS IS THE MOMENT. Harvey watches aides on the phones comb
          districts for voting results. Jim fills up a map on the wall.

          DICK PABICH
          San Bernadino is coming in. Not
          good.

          HARVEY MILK
          Of course not. How not good?

          MICHAEL WONG
          60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno.

          HARVEY MILK
          Dear God, little Lotus Blossom.
          Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar
          results. They go up in red on the map.

          JIM RIVALDO
          Imperial is 69% "for" so far.

          HARVEY MILK
          Put it up on the board.
          Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss.
          He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up
          to Harvey, concerned.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          The whole world is watching this.
          This is San Francisco we're about
          to lose. Are you ready?

          CLEVE JONES
          I can have 15,000 people in an
          hour. But there's gonna be riots if
          this thing passes.

          HARVEY MILK
          (darkens, pointed)
          There goddamn better be.

          CLEVE JONES
          (stops, a beat, then:)
          What are you telling me?

          

          

          

          

          91.

          HARVEY MILK
          I can't say it because I'm a public
          official, but for God's sake, if
          this thing passes, fight back.
          Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words.
          Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Don Amador down in LA.

          HARVEY
          (reluctantly answers)
          Kind of a bad time, Don.

          YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)
          No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave
          me the phone.

          HARVEY MILK
          Paul who?

          YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)
          You talked to me on the phone a
          year or so ago. I'm from
          Minnesota... I'm in a wheelchair.
          REVEAL: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end.

          HARVEY MILK
          (a beat to take it in, then:)
          I thought you were a goner, Paul.

          YOUNG TEEN
          I'm sorry. I should have called.
          When I read in the paper that you
          won the Supervisor seat, I got a
          friend to put me on a bus to LA.

          HARVEY MILK
          Who did you know in Los Angeles?

          YOUNG TEEN
          Nobody. That's the uh... I just
          didn't want to die anymore, sir.
          (Harvey's at a loss for words)
          I met your friend Don down here. I
          turned 18. I voted today against
          Prop Six... Thank you, Mr. Milk.

          HARVEY MILK
          No. You did this all by yourself.

          

          

          

          

          92.

          YOUNG TEEN
          I don't think I'd be alive right now
          without you, sir. You were right
          about LA. It's like gay Disney
          World.

          HARVEY MILK
          Then you have to see San Francisco!

          YOUNG TEEN
          Okay. I will. Don wanted me to
          um... congratulate you on what he
          says looks like a big win for us
          tonight. Congratulations Mr. Milk.
          Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in
          LA county with green. On the other end of the phone, Harvey's
          friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line.

          DON AMADOR (V.O.)
          It looks like we've taken LA
          County, Harvey. By 65%. It's huge.

          HARVEY MILK
          I gotta go, Don. Thank you.
          (frantic, to the room)
          LA by 65% put it up! Put it up!
          The tone in the room is changing. Jim storms up.

          JIM RIVALDO
          The polls were off. Briggs is going
          down by more than 2 to 1. The only
          district where it's leading in San
          Francisco is Dan White's.
          Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map. Anne, Dick & Jim,
          all the volunteers. What this apparent win means to him, to
          his people. To Cleve:

          HARVEY MILK
          Well crap Cleve, now what are we
          going to do tonight?!
          (re: a giant, jock strap
          wearing, Lady Liberty)
          Cover up Lady Liberty. The cameras
          will be coming our way.

          131 INT. "NO ON SIX" CENTER / MARKET STREET - LATER

          TV cameras roll. Lady liberty is covered with a "No on Six"
          poster. A brass band marches dramatically into the hall.
          Balloons fall. Harvey MOUNTS the stage to INCREDIBLE CHEERS.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          HARVEY MILK
          To the gay community all over this
          state... my message to you is... so
          far a lot of people joined us and
          rejected Proposition Six, and now we
          owe them something... We must destroy
          the myths once and for all, shatter
          them. We must continue to speak
          out... and most importantly, most
          importantly, every gay person must
          come out.

          (CHEERS)
          Tonight... Tonight it is clear that
          everyone out there does know one of
          us. And now that they do, they see
          we are not sick... they can feel we
          are not wrong... and they know we
          should have a place in this great
          country and in this world... A
          message of hope has been to sent to
          all the young people out there...
          to all those afraid of this wave of
          hate... to all those who have lost
          their homes and their hometowns...
          tonight we know there is a place
          for us! My brothers and sisters...
          we can come home again!
          The crowd goes WILD. Harvey BEAMS. Moscone walks up onto
          stage and lifts Harvey's hand. Harvey is now a member of the
          S.F. political elite. Cleve watches from afar as Harvey steps
          off and disappears into the crowd.

          132 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME - NIGHT

          Dan watches HARVEY'S VICTORY SPEECH on the local news.

          133 EXT. THE CASTRO - MOMENTS LATER

          The party behind him, Harvey scans the block. Cleve catches
          up, looking at Harvey, probing:

          CLEVE JONES
          What's the matter?

          HARVEY MILK
          You ever heard of sore losers? Well,
          I'm a sore winner... I thought we
          were goners.

          (HALF-JOKING)
          I'd started looking forward to the
          riots.

          

          

          

          

          94.

          CLEVE JONES
          I told you, I don't "do" losing.

          HARVEY MILK
          I think maybe we're best with our
          backs to the wall. It's too quiet.
          (a new idea, what's next)
          I think we should march on
          Washington D.C. next year.

          CLEVE JONES
          Milk, you're a decent politician, a
          mediocre businessman, but you're a
          lousy gay man.
          (Harvey knows what he's
          getting at)
          Take some time off. Fifty's right
          around the corner.
          (a devilish grin)
          Nobody will want you after that...
          I can handle D.C.

          HARVEY MILK
          (smiles, incredulous)
          The people voted for us, Cleve Jones.

          CLEVE JONES
          They did. There's nowhere to march
          tonight, Mr. Harvey Milk. Lets go
          back inside.
          Turning back, they savor the moment, like father and son
          walking to Castro Camera, growing ever smaller in the frame.

          134 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - DAY

          Dan White slides a sealed letter across a desk to an Aide.
          It's addressed to Moscone. He seems oddly calm.

          DAN WHITE
          Could you give this to the Mayor
          for me? As soon as possible.

          135 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - DAY

          Harvey walks down the hallway to his office, a spring in his
          step. There are nods, hellos if not outright deference from
          most passersby. His newfound political muscle is evident.
          He comes face to face with Dan White.

          HARVEY MILK
          Morning, Dan.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          DAN WHITE
          I just resigned. Congratulations.
          I'm sure you're pleased.
          Harvey doesn't know what to say. Dan's right, it does make
          him happy. But it's not that simple.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          You'll be the next President of the
          Board.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm sure we could work together--
          Dan walks away from Harvey. He doesn't want to hear anything
          Harvey has to say.
          Harvey watches as Dan is met in the hallway by an OFFICER
          from the POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.

          OFFICER
          Hey, Dan. Just got word. Can we
          talk to you for a minute?

          DAN WHITE
          Sure...
          Dan heads for his office.

          OFFICER
          Downstairs. The Association
          meeting room...
          Harvey watches as Dan follows the officer down the stairs to
          an ASSOCIATION MEETING ROOM on the next floor. When the DOOR
          OPENS, Harvey sees SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES from the Police
          Department wearing somber expressions.
          It looks as if Dan is about to get REAMED OUT.

          136 INT. TV NEWS REPORT - DAY

          ACTUAL FOOTAGE: Channel 5 reporting from Dan White's street:

          DAVID FOWLER (ON TV)
          Most people were surprised when Dan
          White quit last Friday citing
          financial difficulties. Now we've
          heard that White is asking for his
          Supervisor job back. But many say--

          137 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Harvey, watching on the small TV set in his office.

          

          

          

          

          96.

          DAVID FOWLER (ON TV)
          --White gave up all of his
          political chits when he resigned
          without making any arrangements.
          The news story transitions in the B.G. as Harvey gets up.

          NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV/BG)
          The city of San Francisco is in
          disbelief. Four-hundred bodies have
          been found thus far in Jonestown,
          Guyana. Leader of the People's
          Temple, Jim Jones...

          138 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Harvey heads to Dan's office. He toys with the nameplate.
          Something bittersweet lingers. He walks in.
          HARVEY'S POV: On City Hall's lawn, Dan is with the press. He
          looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window.
          They make eye contact. It bears all the awkwardness of a
          relationship lost.

          139 EXT. CITY HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          Something's snapped. With adolescent frustration in evidence,
          Dan is with his wife, the press and a few supporters.

          DAN WHITE
          It was a major decision on Friday
          that I had to come... to arrive at.
          But since that time, people unknown
          to me, plus my family and friends,
          have come to me and stated that
          they want me to stay in office,
          that they support me... So I'm
          asking the Mayor to let me stay in
          office to serve the people...

          140 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Harvey is firm, his hands planted on the Mayor's desk.

           HARVEY MILK
          He gets dragged into a closed door
          meeting with the Police Officers
          Association, and comes out
          demanding his job back? What do you
          think they promised him? Or worse,
          how did they threaten him?

          

          

          

          

          97.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          A man has the right to change his
          mind. Give me some peace.

          HARVEY MILK
          How many of our propositions has
          Dan shut down? We could finally
          settle this police desegregation
          nonsense. Cement rent control. It's
          his vote on this Board that stands
          in our way.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          I get it, Harvey. I've been lobbied
          all week. Enough.

          HARVEY MILK
          Let me just remind you that you're
          up for re-election. If you re-
          appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote.
          They listen to me. You won't get
          elected dog catcher.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          (stern, silent, a beat, then:)
          I'll make my decision on Monday.
          (as Harvey's on his way out,
          with a wry grin)
          You know what you sounded like just
          now? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly.

          HARVEY MILK
          (returns the smile)
          A "homosexual" with a bit of
          power... rather scary isn't it, Mr.
          Mayor?
          OFF Harvey. He's come a long way.

          OPERA MUSIC CROSSES THE CUT TO:

          141 INT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

          Harvey sits in a balcony seat of the filled, darkened opera
          house next to Brazilian opera star BIDU SAYAO, 76. He's
          enraptured by a production of TOSCA.
          ON STAGE IT'S "O Scarpia, we shall meet before God!" Refusing
          to be taken prisoner, Tosca jumps from the walls of the
          castle set to her death.

          142 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Mary Ann offers the phone to Dan. Dan takes it.

          

          

          

          

          98.

          DAN WHITE
          (into the phone)
          Yes. This is Dan White.

          KCBS REPORTER (V.O.)
          I'm Barbra Taylor from KCBS. I'm
          interested in your reaction. I've
          received information from the
          Mayor's office that you won't be
          getting your job back.

          DAN WHITE
          I'm sorry. I don't know anything
          about that.
          Dan hangs up on her.

          143 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Harvey can't sleep. He dials the phone. He lets it ring and
          ring. Finally, a voice picks up on the other line.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Hello?
          REVEAL: Scott, half asleep.

          HARVEY MILK
          Sorry to wake you up.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What's wrong?

          HARVEY MILK
          I went to the opera tonight. Guess
          who my date was.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Who?

          HARVEY MILK
          Bidu Sayao herself. She was in the
          first Puccini I ever saw. The crowd
          went wild. It was like I was young
          again, seeing my first live opera...

          SCOTT SMITH
          If you go to the opera again, you
          should call me.

          HARVEY MILK
          Really?
          Scott gets out of bed, considers his words. It's intimate.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Yes. I'd go with you.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'd like that.
          Harvey is quiet, a rare moment of reflection. An unexpected
          tear rolls down his cheek.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey?

          HARVEY MILK
          Look out the window, the sun's
          coming up.

          SCOTT SMITH
          It's late. You should get some
          sleep.

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't want to miss it.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Miss what?

          HARVEY MILK
          This.
          Harvey's single word answer means, "Life."
          OFF Harvey: Neither wants to hang up the phone.

          144 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME / LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          The sun rising in his own living room, Dan White has been up
          all night, too. The coffee table is covered with coke cans
          and junk food wrappers.

          145 INT. CITY HALL - DAY

          Waiting for a MAN inside to turn away, Dan sneaks in through
          a side window at City Hall. The man calls after him:

          MAN
          Hey, wait a minute, Mr.--

          DAN WHITE
          My aide was supposed to come down
          here and let me in the side door,
          but she never showed up.

          MAN
          And you are?

          

          

          

          

          100.

          DAN WHITE
          I'm Dan White. City Supervisor.
          We follow Dan down the hall and into the grand entry-way.

          146 INT. CITY HALL / METAL DETECTORS - SAME

          Harvey walks through City Hall's METAL DETECTORS. He picks up
          his keys from the dish and heads up the grand staircase. Like
          ships in the night, Harvey just misses Dan exiting the
          elevator. Dan heads into Mayor Moscone's office.

          147 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

          With Dianne, Harvey is thrilled, rubbing it in.

          HARVEY MILK
          Who's it gonna be? Is he replacing
          Dan with that God Damned liberal
          lefty Don Horanzy? That'll really
          shake up the Board, huh?

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          All I know is that we're getting a
          new Supervisor today. If Dan shows
          up, just avoid him. We don't need
          a scene today, right Harvey?

          HARVEY MILK
          (grins ear to ear)
          Heaven forbid, Dianne.

          148 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME

          The MAYOR'S SECRETARY sits at her desk. Shouting can be heard
          from inside his office.

          149 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME

          Moscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office. Dan is
          enraged. Moscone lights a cigarette.

          DAN WHITE
          You can't take this away from me!
          Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          The issue is what's fair, for the
          people of your district. Take some
          time off. Spend it with your
          family.

          

          

          

          

          101.
          Moscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan
          White brandishing his revolver.

          150 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME

          Moscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL
          THUDS, not so different than a backfire. The secretary looks
          out the window, concerned. The waiting man checks his watch.

          151 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME

          Still gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole
          in his tie.

          152 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

          Dan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office. Harvey's
          voice can be heard down the hall. He sounds up-beat,

          OPTIMISTIC:

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          This time next year we're marching
          on Washington D.C. It'll look like
          Market and Castro, but with a
          million people. Write that down.
          Tell President Carter we're coming
          after him next. I'm going to
          deposit this. I'll be back in 20
          minutes.
          Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND,
          preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway.

          DAN WHITE
          Say, Harve, can I see you for a
          minute?

          HARVEY MILK
          Sure.
          Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office.

          153 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Harvey walks in first. Dan stays between Harvey and the door.
          Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off.
          Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires.
          The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm.

          HARVEY MILK
          Oh no... N--
          Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he
          falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward
          it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the
          Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it.
          HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city.
          Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head. HE FIRES.
          And just like that, Harvey falls.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Last week I got a phone call--

          156 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL

           Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder...

           HARVEY
          --from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and
          the voice was quite young, and the
          person said... "Thanks." You've got
          to elect gay people so that that
          young child and the thousands upon
          thousand like him know there's
          hope... hope for a better world...

          157 INT. MEMORIAL SERVICE / SAN FRANCISCO - EARLY EVENING

          Scott and Anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service.
          Most of the seats are empty. The speaker is unfamiliar, some
          appointed CITY OFFICIAL.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (finally crumbling, tears roll)
          Where is everybody? Didn't anyone
          give a damn?

          158 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL

          Harvey speaking into the tape recorder.

          HARVEY MILK
          I ask this... If there should be an
          assassination, I would hope that
          five, ten, one hundred, a thousand
          would rise. I would like to see
          every gay lawyer, every gay
          architect come out--

          159 EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE 1978 - CONTINUOUS

          Walking back out onto the street, Anne and Scott turn to look
          down Market Street, the camera pans and drifts to reveal:

          

          

          

          

          103.

          A MASSIVE CANDLELIGHT MARCH. CLEVE JONES LEADS TENS OF
          THOUSANDS of San Franciscans of every religion, nationality,
          sexuality, all of the familiar faces and many new ones...
          THEY ALL MARCH SILENTLY up Market Street to the palace Harvey
          dreamed could be his own: City Hall.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          --If a bullet should enter my
          brain, let that bullet destroy
          every closet door... And that's
          all. I ask for the movement to
          continue. Because it's not about
          personal gain, not about ego, not

          but the Blacks, the Asians, the
          disabled, the seniors, the us's.
          Without hope, the us's give up--

 "MINORITY REPORT" 
               -- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen


 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her
               features as fragile as porcelain.  Her eyes are closed in
               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.

               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are
               male, and they float into position on either side of the
               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,
               and like the female their eyes are closed.

               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,
               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,
               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.

               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp
               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes
               open.

               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.

               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a
               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...

 FEMALE                               (frightened woman)
 JOHNNY, PLEASE MALE RIGHT                               (mocking man)
                         "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 FEMALE                          You're scaring me.

 MALE LEFT                               (child's voice)
 DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
 MALE RIGHT                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 FEMALE                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me.  Please.

 MALE RIGHT                          Oh, Carol.

 FEMALE                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 

 MALE RIGHT                          Don't grab at me!  Let

 MALE LEFT                          Daddy!  No!

               All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but
               we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a
               man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,
               the whimpering cries of their son.

               And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three
               faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.
               Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.

               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt
               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare
               straight at us, accusing.

               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and
               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 EXT. SUBURBIA DAY 
               Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the
               midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
               the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.
               Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.

               In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,
               long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.

               Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on
               trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,
               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go
               back into their houses.

               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,
               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It
               is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are
               safe.

 INT. A HOUSE 
               A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone
               fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,
               a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of
               children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. 

               A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a
               picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly
               at the scene outside.

 CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL 
               A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball
               gets away from her, and rolls into the street.

               At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds
               the corner.

               The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.

 THE FAMILY ROOM 
               Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry
               out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She
               watches.  And smiles a little.

 OUTSIDE 
               The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white
               shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
               the car.

               Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.
               Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in
               front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.

               Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road
               in front of him, going for her ball.

               CAROL Watches, her smile in place.

 OUTSIDE 
	       The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears 
	       down on her.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a
               halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
               what is happening.

 THE STREET 
               The car has stopped, inches from the girl.

               The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.
               She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. 

               The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on
               its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and
               disappears.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she
               sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his
               pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?

 JOHNNY                               (gruff)
                         Why'd you let me sleep so long?

 CAROL                          It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --
                              (beat)
                         Why are you staring at me like that?

               He takes a step toward her.  He stands there, his thick black
               hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,
               considering her.

 JOHNNY                          I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
                         long.

               He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.
               A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks
               at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,
               without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his
               way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which
               sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has
               caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
               which lie across a fold of colored cloth.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down
               his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.
               Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.

               A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills
               with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,
               alarmed.

               In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban
               trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.

               The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone
               freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
               drama.

               Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK
               TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they
               seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
               Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
               process them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. 

               Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
               More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their
               uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their
               left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some
               sort of complicated glove.

 CLOSE 
 ON - A GLOVE 
               The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger
               ending in an open barrel.

               Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not
               America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world
               of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is
               intermeshed with hypertechnology.

               And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he
               makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering
               behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out
               of the way.

               Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a
               backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
               handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.

               He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an
               IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.

               The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver
               a dozen times.

               In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three
               dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning
               like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming
               police deterrent presence has been established.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,
               too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and
               which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the
               futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.

 INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET 
               Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his
               wife's dresses.

 UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
               Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands
               out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points
               his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove
               BEEPS softly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. 

               The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears
               on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
               man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
               officer.

 THE BEDROOM 
               The room is packed with police -- how many are real?

 THE CLOSET 
               Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls
               out through the door.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do anything!

 OUTSIDE THE CLOSET 
               Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
               his index barrel at the closet door.  The effect is deeply
               accusatory.

               An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to
               be as menacing as possible.

 OFFICER 1                          Come out of the closet on your hands
                         and knees.

               Nothing happens.  Two officers aim their barrels at the
               perimeter of the door.  In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the
               closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among
               the dresses.

               Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is
               blasted away beneath his feet.

 OFFICER 1                          Hands and knees!

               Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops.
               He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.  He lifts
               his head and looks up at the officer.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't... 

		Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
		"IdentiScan" on its side -- and blips a red laser light 
		into each of Johnny's, eyes, reading his irises.  The 
                officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.

 OFFICER 2 POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. 

 OFFICER 1                               (to Johnny)
                         John Palmer, if you were being
                         arrested for any other crime, I would
                         now read you your rights.
                              (beat)
                         But you are under arrest for the
                         future murderer of your wife, Carol
                         Palmer.  You have no rights.

               Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- LATER 
               In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police
               vehicle as the neighbors look on.  Carol and her son stand
               in the doorway, stunned.

               TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets.  The first man is tall,
               sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is PAUL ANDERSON,
               late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington
 D.C. 
               The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,
               late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the
               shoulders, short brown hair.

               The two men are deeply comfortable together.  They can speak,
               or not.  It doesn't matter -- they still communicate.  Two
               good cops, good together.

               They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the
               holographic decoy cops.

 WITWER                          Thought we might a had a runner.

               Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah, a runner.

 WITWER                          A little chase -- that'd been good.

 ANDERSON                          Fifty cops on the scene takes the
                         chase out of them.

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         But only eight of us were real.

               Witwer dematerializes the last decoy.

 ANDERSON                          We ever get a runner, I'd be too old
                         to give chase.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. 

 WITWER                          You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man.

               They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime
               vehicle holding Johnny zoom SOUNDLESSLY away.

 ANDERSON                          I love it more Johnny boy doesn't
                         get to murder his wife.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         It's a beautiful world.

 EXT. SAME SCENE -- LATER 
               The children play on their trikes.  The wives talk among
               themselves.  The birds sing, the dogs bark.

               The little girl bounces her red ball again.  She stops a.
               minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her,
               unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape.

 INT. A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON) DAY 
               Decorated in a 1950's style.  Anderson lies in bed beside
               his wife, LISA, a pretty, green-eyed brunette.  It is early
               morning, they are both awake.  Her hand caresses his chest.
               Maybe they will make love.

               Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.

 LISA                          Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering.
                              (playfully)
                         I excite you that much?

               He turns to her, and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile
               vanish.

 ANDERSON                          I used to love being a cop.  

 LISA                          You're still a cop.  I'm a factory
                         worker.  We don't catch murderers.
                         We process them.

               Lisa takes a long breath.  She's been down this road before.
               She speaks reassuringly.

 LISA                          You're the best homicide cop in the
                         country.

	       ANDERSON snorts disdainfully.

 ANDERSON                          Great -- except there's no such thing
                         as homicide.  What I do best doesn't
                         exist anymore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. 

 LISA PAUL.                               (beat)
                         You're the Director of a perfect
                         system.  A Cop with a perfect record

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs have a perfect record.
                         They identify the accused -- I just
                         put on my monkey suit and go round
                         them up.

               Lisa hugs him, kisses the back of his neck.

 LISA                          And then I prosecute them.  And they
                         go to jail.  And lives are saved.
                         Thousands of lives.
                              (beat)
                         And that's a cop's dream.

               Anderson is silent for a time.  He sighs, then smiles, and
               turns to his wife, takes her in his arms.

 ANDERSON                          No.  You're a cop's dream.

 INT. THE BATHROOM -- LATER 
               Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself
               dry- He glances out a casement window.  He tilts his head,
               curious, then wipes at the steam on the window.

 ANDERSON'S POV LISA 
               Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a
               cell phone.  She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.

 ANDERSON 
               Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.

 INT. KITCHEN -- LATER 
               Checkered linoleum floor.  Appliances out of the 1950's.

               Except there are little differences.  When Lisa puts a skillet
               of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric
               coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light.

               Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket.
               Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt,
               wingtipped shoes.  He doesn't look up from the newspaper as
               he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          Who called?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. 

               Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs.  She touches
               her long brown hair.

 LISA                          No one.  I called about my hair.
                         Getting it done this afternoon.

               Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when
               suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door.  Anderson and
               Lisa both turn and smile.

 ANDERSON                          Come on in, neighbor.  Want some
                         coffee?

 OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
               FRANK D'IGNAZIO, 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before
               coming in.  A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches
               quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his
               EYES, scanning the irises.  The arm lifts out of view, the
               screen door UNLATCHES.

               Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Brought these for your supper.

 LISA                          Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank
                         you.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Sweet, nothing.  I gotta get rid of
                         these things.  One plant, and I'm
                         invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a
                         kid ...

               Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back,
               teases him.

 ANDERSON                          Before all this genetically engineered
                         crap ...

               Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be
                         a challenge to grow things.  An art.
                         Now you put one plant in the ground
                         -- then jump the hell out of the
                         way.

               Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down.

 ANDERSON                          Coffee?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. 

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys
                         are rushing off to work anyway.

               Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson.

 LISA                          You and Ellie come for supper then.

 ANDERSON                          We'll barbecue.

               Frank nods and pushes on the screen door.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          You betcha.  We'll bring some more
                         tomatoes -- a new batch will have
                         grown by then.

               They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper.

 EXT. DRIVEWAY -- LATER 
               Anderson waves to Lisa.  Her big Studebaker drives off down
               the tree-lined street and away.

               Anderson approaches his Chevy.  He doesn't take out a key to
               unlock it.  There is no lock.  He slides in behind the wheel.
               Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no
               ignition.

               A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans
               Anderson's EYES, identifying him.  A seat harness wraps around
               him, and the car STARTS.

               Anderson picks up a folder marked "Precrime" and begins to
               read through the papers.  The Chevy backs out of the driveway
               and takes him to work.

 EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA, VA -- LATER 
               A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the
               spillover from Washington D.C. across the Potomac River into
               Virginia.

               Beyond the white of Washington is "The Sprawl" -- the massive
               unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts
               of the Capitol.  It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially
               to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs.

               Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars.
               Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them.  In the
               sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,
               holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.
               On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to
               flash: "I LIKE MIKE!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. 

               Then a picture of the smiling President appears.  Then the
               words: "RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR
 YEARS! KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE!" 
 INSIDE ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic
               road sign.

               THE ROAD SIGN reads: "FBI Headquarters 1 mile.  CIA
               Headquarters 1.5 miles.  PRECRIME Headquarters 2 miles."

               Anderson goes back to his papers.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair.
               He abruptly rises and begins to pace.  The room is large,
               but he paces like a lion confined in a cage.

               He punches an intercom.  A female VOICE responds.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          Yes, Director Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he
                         delivered this morning's Precog discs?

               Ed Witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks
               in.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          I'll find him, sir.

               Ed shakes his head, smiles.

 WITWER                          Bullying the staff again, Director
                         Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Screw you.

               Anderson turns away and stares out a large window.  Witwer
               joins him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Was that fun for you, yesterday?

 WITWER                          The Johnny Palmer bust?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It was okay.  We got our man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. 

               Anderson takes a long breath.

 ANDERSON                          When do we not get our man?

               They turn as Ennis PAGE, 44, a thin, tight little man with
               burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room.  He carries a
               black BRIEFCASE marked:

               "Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria, VA." The case is cuffed
               to his wrist.

 PAGE                          Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put
                         out a heavy national volume this
                         morning -- four for our zone.

 ANDERSON (DISTRACTED)                          Put the case on my desk, Ennis.

               Page hesitates, doesn't do it.  Anderson moves quickly to
               Page.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          What was I thinking.

               Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE.  A small panel recedes, a
               red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, BEEPS
               affirmatively, then clicks off.  The cuff on Page's wrist
               falls open.

               Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk.  Page hesitates.
               Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do.  Page
               reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers
               strewn on Anderson's desk.

               Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles.  When Page looks
               up they try to cover, but are not quick enough.  He frowns
               tightly, and heads for the door.

               Anderson calls after him.

 ANDERSON                          Thanks, Ennis.  

               Witwer turns to leave, too.

 WITWER                          Now that's a guy who really cares.

               Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office.

               Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens
               the briefcase.  Four small bright DISCS sit in rows.  He
               removes one, places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into
               view from the center of his desk.  He sits back, weary, and
               watches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. 

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A young black woman stands in a hallway.  She stares at a
               door, gun in hand.  She opens the door, enters a bedroom.

               She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping.  She
               lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form.

               ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new
               disc.

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A white woman stands at a stove, cooking.  A man comes up
               behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands.
               He raises the necktie toward her neck

 ANDERSON 
               He's not watching the screen.  He is out of his chair now, 
               looking out the window.

 INT. PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY 
               A tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations
               tours run by present-day FBI.  The TOUR GUIDE, a pretty,
               smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of
               adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the
               building.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Precrime was established in 2030,
                         with the harnessing of the remarkable
                         talents of the Precognitive mutants.

               She points cheerfully to a stubby little man, MR. HARRIS.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
                         Precogs there are?

 MR. HARRIS                          Three.  Uh, right?

 TOUR GUIDE                          That's exactly right!  A lot of people
                         assume there are Precogs in every
                         branch office.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. 

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          But there are only three Precogs,
                         right here in this building.  And
                         the information they give us, we
                         send out to all the other branches.
                              (beat)
                         And what is that information -what
                         do the Precogs do?

               An eager boy, TIMMY has the answer to that one.

 TIMMY                          They protect us.

               The guide tousles his hair.

 TOUR GUIDE                               (chipper voice)
                         That's right, Timmy.  Because of the
                         Precogs, you're going to grow up
                         murderfree.  Isn't that something?

 MR. HARRIS                          They ever wrong?  The Precogs ever
                         screw up when they predict a murder?

               The guide laughs tolerantly.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Never, sir.  It's an infallible
                         system.  The Precogs predict a
                         homicide, and our Precrime police
                         then apprehend that future murderer
                         before the event occurs.  And right
                         next door is the Judicial Center,
                         where we prosecute the
                         future murderers.

 TIMMY                          Can we see the Precogs?

 TOUR GUIDE                          No, I'm sorry.  That part of the
                         building is not open to the public.
                              (beat)
                         Now, if you'll just step this way
 ... 
               She waves the group on toward an elevator.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed
               for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs.  They
               are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. 

               Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees.  The bodies
               of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed,
               groomed.

               The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate HELMET
               that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright
               metallics.  The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces
               seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.

               A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of
               light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize
               into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe
               computer.

               The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.
               They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.
               Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes
               from murders only they can see.  Life for a Precog is an
               endless cycle of death.

 CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG 
               we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening
               scene of the movie.  She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.
               Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or
               eternally old.

               The technicians lift her from her bath.  She is dried, dressed
               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.
               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side
               of her.

               Not once are their helmets removed.  What they feed into the
               mainframe is too valuable.  It must be gathered twenty-four
               unrelenting hours a day.

 INT. A ROOM 
               Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber.  He
               can see them through a large window.  He works a large
               computer console, the gathering point for the information
               the Precogs constantly feed the computer.

               Perhaps every ten seconds, a small DISC is released by the
               computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under
               Page's watchful eye -- into a black case.

               ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page.  As
               Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from
               his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in
               the room as an intruder in his special domain.

               Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs.

 ANDERSON                          What would they think about if we
                         unhooked them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. 

               Page looks up from his work.

 PAGE                          They don't think, sir.  They just
                         see.

               Anderson is silent.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          They're not even alive, really.

               Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then
               turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 


               The female Precog sits in her chair.  Her eyes are open.
               She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room.
               In the window we see Anderson leaving the room.

               The female Precog's eyes drift closed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT.COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               A trial is in progress.  The defendant is Johnny Palmer.  He
               sits, ashen, at a table, his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him.

               There are no jurors in the Juror BOX.  There is a JUDGE, 55,
               and stern.  There are a few people in the public seats.

               The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson.  She
               wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,
               Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.

 LISA                          Director Anderson, do you swear that
                         the disc you now present to the court
                         is the only and authentic disc of
                         the future murder of Carol Palmer by
                         her husband, John Palmer?

               It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of
               times.  Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the
 DISC. 
 ANDERSON                          Yes.  This is the only and authentic
                         disc of the event seen by the
                         Precognitive mutants and recorded by
                         the Precrime Division.  This is the
                         immutable evidence of the infallible
                         system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. 

 LISA                          The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
 ... ? 
 ANDERSON                          In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at
                         10:33 in the morning.

               Lisa steps back.  The judge reaches out and Anderson hands
               him the disc.  The judge inserts it into a special video
               machine on his desk.  Anderson steps down, his ritual part
               in this trial completed.

               A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge.  He does not
               turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor.

               Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide.  We now see, in detail,
               what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning
               of the movie.

 THE MONITOR 
               The Palmer's family room.  Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing
               basket for the scissors.  Carol stands defenseless in front
               of him.  Their son cowers in a corner of the room.

 CAROL                          Johnny, please --

 JOHNNY                          "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 CAROL                          You're scaring me.

 JOHNNY'S SON DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
               Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace.

 JOHNNY                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 CAROL                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me. Please.  

               We cut away from the monitor and stay on JOHNNY PALMER'S FACE 
               as he sits at the defense table.  He winces at each terrible exchange.

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Oh, Carol.

 CAROL (O.S.)                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. 

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Don't grab at me!  Let go...

 JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.)                          Daddy!  No!

               Johnny Palmer cries out as the MONITOR goes blank.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It
                         didn't happen!

               The JUDGE hits his gavel.

 JUDGE                          How does the defense plead?

               The defense attorney glances at his watch, then quickly
               rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual.

 DEFENSE ATTORNEY                          The defense acknowledges the
                         infallibility of the system.  We are
                         Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the
                         mercy of the court.

 JOHNNY                          No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No!

               The court guards are on him in an instant.  They lead him
               out of the courtroom.

 INT.A BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and
               enters a disheveled room.  The fifties interior is drab: a
               Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in
               front of a TV.

               Ed Witwer is already on the scene.  He stands a few feet
               from the BODY of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun
               on the floor nearby.

 WITWER                               (to Anderson)
                         Looks like the old days.

               Anderson nods to his former partner.  Anderson leans over
               the body.

 ANDERSON                          That would be bad news for an
                         infallible system.

               Witwer is suddenly bored.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20. 

 WITWER                          We know it can't be a murder -- the
                         Precogs would've seen it.  Why do
                         you insist on coming to these things?

 ANDERSON                          Keeps the system honest.  And besides,
                         I like to pretend I'm a cop.

               Anderson turns to an officer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Who's got the Coroner?

               Another OFFICER steps forward with a large blue case.

 OFFICER                          Right here, sir.

               The officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the
               latches.  Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS: the
               "Coroner."

               It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises
               crab-like, and steps out of its case.

               Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move.  His projected
               image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his
               back.  He is the interface, the way the humans communicate
               with the crab apparatus.

 ANDERSON                          Hi DOC.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Hello, Director Anderson.

               The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down
               on the floor.  It moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the
               body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core
               samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.

 WITWER                          This a homicide, Doc?

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I'm presently analyzing neurohormones,
                         Assistant Director Witwer.  I have
                         not concluded my examination.

               The crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          I'm detecting carbonization of skull
                         fragments around the entry wound.

               Witwer whispers to Anderson.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. 

 WITWER                          Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his
                         own head.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I have not determined that yet,
                         Assistant Director.

               Witwer grins.

 WITWER                          You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.

               The coroner crab steps away from the body.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Please rotate the corpse to the
                         lateral supine position.

               Two officers turn the body face-up.  The crab inches close
               to probe the face.  Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids,
               and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment
               the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive.

               Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it
               comes to a standstill.  The holographic Doctor closes his
               eyes as if in thought.

 WITWER                          Can you imagine if this was a
                         homicide?  Who even knows how to
                         hunt down a killer any more?

               Anderson gives him a hard look.

 ANDERSON                          I know how, dammit.  You know how.

 WITWER                          Easy, partner.
                              (beat)
                         But you know what I'm saying.  The
                         state legislatures are pushing to
                         stop funding for training homicide
                         detectives ...

 ANDERSON                          God bless the Precogs.

               The Doctor opens his eyes.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          This event is a negative homicide.
                         A mortal wound was generated by a
                         .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
                         the parietal 'portion of the skull
                         on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm,
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. 

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          Eastern Standard Time.  This event
                         is a positive suicide.

               The holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears
               back into the coroner crab.  The crab crawls back into its
               case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and
               shuts down.

               Witwer turns to Anderson.

 WITWER                          It's time to stop coming to these,
                         partner.

               Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a
               stretcher.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  You're right.

 INT. A BANQUET - WASHINGTON, D.C. -- NIGHT 
               Anderson, in black-tie, with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown
               at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level
               government officials and politicians.

 ANDERSON                          A little bit of me dies every time I
                         come to one of these things.

 LISA                          It's only a party, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I'd never have let them appoint me
                         to Precrime if I'd have known this
                         was going to be part of it.

 LISA                          You're exactly what Precrime needed.
                         An amazing homicide cop and a real
                         person in an unreal job.

 ANDERSON                          Exactly.  

 LISA 			 The public loves the
                         Precogs.  But they give people the
                         creeps, too.  You're something they
                         understandp a regular cop running
                         things.

               Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed
               banquet hall.

 ANDERSON                          Let's invite all these irregular
                         assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers
                         and beer - think they'd come?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. 

               A barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair,
               SENATOR MALCOLM, 58, takes hold of Anderson's elbow from
               behind.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I'd come, Mr. Director.  And I'd
                         make all the other assholes come
                         with me.

               Lisa reddens, Anderson gives an embarrassed cough.  The
               Senator laughs and claps him on the back.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Nice job this morning.  Another
                         negative homicide.  The Precogs never
                         let us down.

               Mrs. Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa, while the Senator eases
               Anderson in the opposite direction 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                         I have a dream, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I know you do, Senator.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just
                         predicting murders, but predicting
                         all crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults
 ... 
 ANDERSON                          How about jaywalking?  Littering?
                         Now there's a crime.

               The Senator smiles through his teeth.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I don't want a police state, you
                         know that.  But we have an opportunity
                         here, and

 ANDERSON                          No sir, we don't have that
                         opportunity.  There are only three
                         Precogs.  They're a lucky accident
                         of nature.  There are no more.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (beat)
                         We can make more.  Just give me your
                         support.  Help me increase funding
                         for the Precog Engineering Project.

 ANDERSON                          Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing
                         into the future is a gift, a
                         nonreproducible event.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          There was only one Mozart, and there
                         are only three Precogs.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be
                         safe.  They want that more than they
                         want food or love.

               He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Look at us -it's 2040 and we've
                         wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's
                         like a big security blanket.  Why?
                         Because we want to feel like they
                         felt.  Safe.

 ANDERSON                          Senator, a world filled with hundreds
                         of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
                         place.

               The Senator gives it one last shot.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Sure could use your help, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (icily)
                         Don't think I'll come to your barbecue
                         after all.

               The senator moves off.  Anderson stands stiffly among the
               sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD DAY 
               Anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, DR,
               RESFIELD, 60, the head scientist.  It is not a place that
               warms Anderson's heart.

               Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting
               and examining protoplasmic tissue masses.  Other technicians
               peer through massive microscopes.  Still others use robotic
               arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass
               barriers.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You don't get out here much.

 ANDERSON                          Not my sort of place.

               Dr. Resfield emits a dry little laugh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          The head of Precrime squeamish?

 ANDERSON                          When it comes to needles and scalpels,
                         yeah.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I promise we won't use any on you.

 ANDERSON                          What do you use them on?

 DR. RESFIELD                               (beat)
                         On bits of this and that.

               Anderson looks at him.  The doctor pauses outside a thick
               door.  An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and
               the door opens with an electronic hiss.

               Anderson looks around the lab.  Technicians lower mesh
               cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT.  Another technician
               turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the
               roiling liquid.

 ANDERSON                          What's happening here?

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're in an interesting phase.

 ANDERSON                          What's in the cylinders?

 DR. RESFIELD                          Neurotissue.

 ANDERSON                          From ...?

 DR. RESFIELD                          A fusion of sources.  From the
                         Precogs' deceased mother.  From the
                         Precogs themselves.

 ANDERSON                          A fusion of ... ?

 DR. RESFIELD                          In lay terms, we mated sperm from
                         the brothers with ova from the mother
                         and sister to create new growth.

               The CYLINDERS shudder as the voltage is increased.

 DR. RESFIELD (CONT'D)                          And then we add mutating variables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. 

               Anderson stares into the roiling vat.  Dr. Resfield waits
               for more questions.  But it is clear from Anderson's
               expression he has already learned enough.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for
               premurders in the local Washington area. We stay on him as he
               watches the monitor.  He pops the disc, jots down some notes,
               slides in the next disc.

               Anderson's mouth slowly opens.  He leans close to the monitor,
               his face ashen.

 EXT. FRANK D'IGNAZIO'S BACKYARD -- LATER 
               Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden.
               He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich
               soil.

               He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate.  He
               lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile.  It's
 ANDERSON. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          What are you doing, playing hooky?

               Anderson tries to smile.  But it won't come.  He looks around
               the abundant garden.

 ANDERSON                          It's great out here, Frank.. You got
                         the touch.

               Frank straightens with a grimace.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          I got the arthritis, is what I got.

               Anderson reflexively looks up at a high WHINING sound from
               over head.  Frank follows his gaze.  A Precrime HOVERCRAFT
               glides into position overhead.

               Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground.  He takes
               a long sad breath.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          Ah shit, neighbor.
                              (beat)
                         Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,
                         do they?
                              (beat)
                         Can we do this inside?  Ellie's not
                         home.

               Anderson's voice is full of pain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. 

 ANDERSON                          Sure, Frank.  Yeah.

 INT. FRANK'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 


               Frank wanders the kitchen, trying to focus on his situation.
               Anderson has trouble meeting his friend's eyes.

               Through a window we can see black suited police officers
               with mirrored helmets swarming outside Frank's house.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (distracted)
                         I thought I'd buried it all.
                         Thirty-five years -- all those minutes
                         and days to bury it.
                              (beat)
                         But suddenly you see the man who
                         murdered your daughter walking the
                         streets -- my God it throws you.

               Frank stops pacing.  He stares at a kitchen drawer.

 ANDERSON                          He'd served his time, Frank.  I know
                         it's not fair.  It's way beyond not
                         fair ...

               Frank looks.  At Anderson bitterly.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (yells)
                         God damn the Precogs.  You know?
                         Why couldn't they have been around
                         to save my girl?
                              (softly)
                         Now they're catching me.

               Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          I really shoot the bastard, huh?
                         When?

 ANDERSON                          Next Wednesday, at noon.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Good.

               Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun.

 ANDERSON                          It's not in you, Frank, to kill
                         anybody.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28. 

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Tell it to the Precogs.  It's set in
                         stone now, right?

               Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter.  Anderson relaxes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (almost inaudible)
                         I don't want to be a part of this
                         world anymore.

 ANDERSON                          I know, Frank.

               Frank gives Anderson a look -- no, friend, you don't know.
               Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (beat)
                         So.  Tell me, Paul.  Do the Precogs
                         see everything?

 ANDERSON                          No.

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Then they won't have seen this.

               Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own
               head.  On Anderson's anguished FACE, at the SOUND of the gun
               going off.

 EXT. FRONT YARD -- LATER 
               Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's
               front porch.  Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa
               comforting Ellie D'Ignazio in the living room.

               Anderson is deeply shaken.  Witwer tries to talk him through
               it.

 WITWER (GENTLY)                          We had to bring him in.

               Anderson doesn't respond.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He was a future murderer.

 ANDERSON                               (angrily)
                         You blame him?  The guy killed his
                         daughter!

               Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Yeah.  I know.  I know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29. 

               Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body
               into the back of an ambulance.  Anderson's bitterness erupts.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in
                         them absolutely and I hate them
                         absolutely.  Jesus.

               Witwer listens to him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          And that goddamn lab trying to grow
                         more of them.  Put a Precog in every
                         home, you know?  So we can have more
                         Franks - people shooting themselves --
                         over who knows what?

               Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing
               tones like you'd calm an agitated horse.

 WITWER                          Precrime did the job it was supposed
                         to do.

               The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You know it.  And you believe in it.

 ANDERSON (BEAT)                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It's not easy.  It beats us down.
                         Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates
                         you right now.

               Anderson turns to Witwer.

 ANDERSON                          That's why I got into this business
                         -- to be hated.

               Anderson almost manages a small smile.  Witwer puts his arm
               around him.  Walks him away from the scene.

 WITWER                          They hated us when we were regular
                         cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they
                         still hate US.  It's one of the little
                         perks of law enforcement nobody knows
                         about.

               Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness.  Anderson looks
               into his partner's good, open face.  Then they both look
               away, their understanding of each other complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. 

 INT. ANDERSON'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT 
               Anderson stares out the window at Frank's house, illuminated
               by the moon.  It's a mournful sight.

               Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS-ALEXANDRIA-DAY - ONE WEEK LATER 
               Ennis Page, in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber,
               picks up a black BRIEFCASE marked: "Zone 218 Washington /
               Alexandria, VA." He approaches the door, and his eyes are
               scanned.  The door opens with a HISS.

               We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until
               he reaches a long hallway leading to the Director's office.
               Anderson's secretary, Angela, looks up on Page's approach.
               She nods.  He nods.

               He walks around her desk.  His eyes are scanned, and the
               door to Anderson's office opens.

               ANDERSON looks up, wearily.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- LATER 
               Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost
               absently.  As we have seen him do before, he swivels his
               chair away from the monitor, and stares at Washington D.C.
               across the Potomac.  Hovercrafts and transports skim through
               the sky above the Washington Monument.

               The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the
               Precog disc begins.  He hears his own voice speaking in
               strained, agitated tones.

 ANDERSON (O.S.)                          Let's not do this, Ed.

               Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and
               horror at the monitor.

 THE MONITOR 
               shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing
               guns directly at each other.  Their eyes intense and panicked.
               Who murders whom?

               Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red
               seconds tumble away.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31. 

               Witwer lowers his gun.  He stands unresisting before

               Anderson.

               Witwer sees his own death in Anderson's wild eyes, has always
               seen it.

               Anderson FIRES his weapon, puts a bullet straight into
               Witwer's heart, throwing him back against a wall.  Witwer
               slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads:

 5:20 AM. 
 BACK TO SCENE 
               Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank.  His hand
               goes to his mouth.  His body begins to shake.  He hugs
               himself, but he can't stop the shaking.

               The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor.  It is a small
               SOUND, but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it
               were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it.
               His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside
               his desk, like a man in need of prayer.

               There is a single thought that screams through his brain.
               It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly.
               Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I kill you.
                              (beat)
                         Oh god, I kill you.

               As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for
               the disc ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie,
               the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness.
               Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON.  They speak as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs
               fade into the mists ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE 
               Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his
               door.  Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED, the
               traffic outside, his own breathing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32. 

               His senses are on overload.

               The door begins to open.  A stockinged leg is the first thing
               Anderson sees.  His secretary, ANGELA.

 ANGELA                          Sir?

               She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs
               at the incriminating disc.  He sees his EYES reflected in
               its alloy surface.  He pushes the disc deep into his pants
               pocket.

               Somehow he finds his voice.

 ANDERSON                          Come in.  Angela.

               She looks at him, uncertain.  Then she places a small stack
               of papers on his desk.

 ANGELA                          Need you to sign these.  And your
                         eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.

 ANDERSON                          My ... eleven.

 ANGELA                               (beat)
                         Budget coordination with the FBI.
                              (beat)
                         You okay, sir?

               Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast
               enough.  He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case.
               He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks.

 ANDERSON                          Have Page take this.

               Angela steps back, disturbed.

 ANGELA                          But sir, the procedure

 ANDERSON (SNAPS)                          I make procedure.  Call him.
                              (long beat)
                         I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right.

               My head and stomach.  I'm going down to the clinic.  Or maybe
               just home.

               Angela looks relieved at the explanation.

 ANGELA                          Yes sir.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33. 

               He moves past her.  His FINGERS fidget against the hidden
               disc in his pocket.

 ANDERSON                          I'll speak to Witwer, put him in
                         charge for the rest of the day.

               He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and
               at his view of Washington.  Then he is gone.

 INT. OUTSIDE WITWER'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office.  He
               takes a step inside.

               Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling
               him.

 WITWER                          Breaking and entering.  That'll get
                         you five to ten, hard.

               Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          What's wrong?

               Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes.  He
               REACHES into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the
               light.  If he could just do that, show it to Witwer.

 WITWER                          Paul?

               Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket, EMPTY.

 ANDERSON                          Take over for me today?

 WITWER                          You sick?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

               Witwer makes a show of backing away.

 WITWER                          Don't give it to me.  You probably
                         have that Trans-10 virus going around.
                         A stomach thing.  I hate stomach
                         things.

               Anderson Almost smiles.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34. 

 WITWER                          Yeah?

               Witwer looks at him.  Anderson almost reaches out for him.

 ANDERSON                          Run the place, okay?

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         Sure.  Right into the ground.
                              (beat)
                         Go on home before I call Infectious
                         Control and have them spray you down
                         with something.

               Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway.  Witwer calls
               out.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You want me to do the discs, or hold
                         them for you to review when you get
                         back?

 ANDERSON                          Can't let them back up.  Do 'em.

 WITWER                          Call you later.  Take it easy, all
                         right?

               Witwer lifts his hand in farewell, Anderson fixes on that
               last image -- Witwer waving goodbye.

 INT. PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER 
               Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar
               and pulls out a cell phone.  He hits a button.

 INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON / LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa sits in a meeting.  Her phone CHIRPS softly.  She glances
               at the display, then rises to take it.  She goes to a corner
               of the room.

 LISA                          Paul?

 ANDERSON                          Listen to me.

               Lisa presses her phone close to her ear.

 LISA                          I can hardly hear you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35. 

 ANDERSON                          I'm underground.  Weakens the signal
                         so it can't be picked up.

               Alarm moves across her face.

 LISA                          But we're on Secure

 ANDERSON                          Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder
                         Ed.

               The Precogs picked it up.

               On Lisa -- can she have heard right?

 LISA                          Paul.  Paul His crackling voice
                         faintly comes through the phone.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          ... home.

               Lisa's phone goes dead.

 BACK TO ANDERSON 
               Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground
               transports.  They are sleek and menacing, the black shells
               lumpy with dangerous gadgetry.  In the distance, a POLICE
               OFFICER, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of
               one of them.

               He looks up at Anderson's approach.  He puts his equipment
               down, and salutes.

 POLICE OFFICER                          Hello, sir.

               Anderson nods, moves close.

 ANDERSON                          What's your name, officer?

 POLICE OFFICER                          Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.

 ANDERSON                          These the new Python transports?

               The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride,
               is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova
               stun gun to the base of his neck.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (sincerely)
                         Sorry, Officer Smythe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36. 

               The officer buckles.  Anderson catches him, rolls him gently
               into the back of the transport.

               Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins
               stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black
               uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic
               scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess
               at.

               Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey FOOTSTEPS.  They
               approach, then fade away.

               Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then
               aims a nozzled cylinder at them.  He shoots a spray of blue
               BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor
               of the transport in an adhesive glob.

               Then he leaves the scene, running.

 INT. ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95.
               The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering
               wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his
               direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now.

               From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn
               and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his
               steering wheel.

               Anderson slams it with his fist.  Through his windshield
               Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a
               passing red and black Ford.  His mother sits in the
               passenger's seat, blithely reading.  The boy mimics Anderson,
               gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs.

               Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance,
               at the "Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington
               D.C. You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in
               there.

 EXT. POTOMAC PARK 
               Anderson stands on an embankment.  He holds the Precog disc
               in his hand, ready to throw it into the river.

               He stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop.
               He doesn't do it.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER 
               Lisa enters the house, in a rush.  Every shade is drawn.
               Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely
               motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.

 ANDERSON                          Don't move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37. 

               Lisa doesn't get it.  She continues toward him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Stop!  Moving heats you up, makes it
                         easier for them to pick you up on
                         their thermals.

               She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks.  She is
               suddenly suffocating.

 LISA                          It's a hundred degrees in here.

 ANDERSON                          I turned the furnace all the way up.
                         Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they
                         come, it'll buy me twenty seconds.
                         Maybe thirty.

 LISA                          Nobody's coming for you.

               Anderson stares at her.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          On the phone -- what you said.  It's
                         impossible.

               She shakes her head in disbelief.  Anderson speaks, choking
               on the words.

 ANDERSON                          I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.

 LISA                          It's not true.

               Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair.
               We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm.  He seems about
               to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet.  He keeps staring at
               her intently.  Something is holding him back.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You're upset.  You've been unhappy.
                         There's a lot of pressure on you.
                         And then Frank ...

 ANDERSON                          One week from today.  Tuesday, June
                         25, at five-twenty in the morning.
                         I shoot him, Lisa.

 LISA                               (beat)
                         You need to take time off.

               Anderson laughs harshly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. 

 ANDERSON                          You don't have to worry about that.

               She steps toward him.

 LISA                               (gently)
                         I want to hold you.

 ANDERSON                          If you love me, stand there.  And
                         don't move.

               Tears well in her eyes.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the disc, Lisa.  I shoot him.
                         In the chest.  And he dies.  I've
                         watched a thousand murders.  This
                         time I star in one.

 LISA                          Something's wrong.  You wouldn't do
                         it.

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs are never wrong.  They
                         emit a single disc.  "The immutable
                         evidence of the infallible system."

               The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway
               unsteadily.

               Anderson focuses on her.  Her face.  Her hair ...

 LISA                          We'll figure this out.  We'll review
                         the system.

 ANDERSON                          There is no review.  There's only
                         the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's
                         no defense.

               Her long hair.  He stares.

 LISA                          You can't run.  Please, let's --

               A SOUND outside.  They both turn.  A deep silence.  The
               furnace churns out heat.  And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair
               ... and finally understands.

               Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the DISC back
               into his pocket.  He rises from his chair.  For the first
               time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. 

 ANDERSON                          Last week.  It was strange.  I watched
                         from the bathroom window.  You went
                         out in the backyard to make a call.

               She looks at him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          An appointment, you said.  For a
                         haircut that afternoon.

               Lisa's hand jumps to her hair.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          You didn't get your hair cut.  You
                         went to the trouble of calling first
                         thing in the morning.  It was that
                         important ...

               She reaches for him.  He pulls away.

 LISA                          Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're
                         panicking.  Everything's going to
                         look wrong.  You're going to distrust
                         everybody and everything now.

               Lisa implores him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You can't distrust me.
                              (beat)
                         It was Ed I called.

               Anderson cocks his head.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it?

 LISA                          Stop being a cop and listen to me!

               A booming, electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates
               the walls of the house from outside.

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Director Anderson!  There is no
                         escape!

               Anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife.  She's frantic.

 LISA                          Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted
                         to...

               But be's already on the move, running for the upstairs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40. 

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Drop to your hands and knees and
                         stay there.  Precrime is entering
                         your house!

               Lisa screams, as her front door is sonically BLASTED off its
               hinges, and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets
               hurtle in.

 LISA                          Paul!

	       They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the 
               stairs like a disease in fast motion.

 UPSTAIRS 
               Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out,
               scanning rooms for thermal presence.

               An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room.  He speaks, his voice
               electronically altered.

 OFFICER 1                          He's got a hair dryer going.  Screwed
                         up my reading.

               The others nod.

 OFFICER 2                          We're not picking up shit.

               They rush into rooms, with increased urgency.  We follow
               OFFICER 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the
               stairs.

               He hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is
               awash in personnel.  Lisa stands against the wall, pale and
               shaken.  He looks at her for a long beat, then steps over
               the shattered door and out into the sunlight.

 OUTSIDE 
               Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm.
               But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has
               kicked.  Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it,
               engines WHINING.  Black Python transports are all over the
               street out in front, and more keep coming.

               And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police.  OFFICER
               I approaches a Python ground transport.  Another officer
               guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left.  He
               settles on OFFICER 1's approach and raises his weapon.

               OFFICER 1 doesn't even break stride.  He walks right up to
               the guard -- and then right through him.  A holograph decoy.
               OFFICER 1 enters the Python.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41. 

 INSIDE THE PYTHON 
               OFFICER 1 removes his helmet -- it's Anderson.  And then
               comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his
               IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet?

               A little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes
               a red beam into his eyes.  Anderson presses his lips together.
               The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson 0256 clear.

               Anderson grips the steering wheel.  But his time, since it
               is a law enforcement.  Vehicle, the steering actually works.
               Anderson pulls out.

               FROM ABOVE, as the Python transport slips away from the chaos.

               THEN HIGHER, and we see that the direction the Python is
               headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through
               the white of Washington, and into the dark of The Sprawl.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 


               Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber.  He stares at an
               oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor.

               He runs both hands through his hair.  He is tired, his eyes
               weary, lost.

               A voice comes over the intercom.

 VOICE                          Enter now please, Assistant Director
                         Witwer.

               Witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door.

 INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM 
               Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table.

               Powerful men sit at the other end of the table.  SWANSON,
               sharp-boned, the FBI Director.  CRONIN, awl-like eyes, the
               CIA Director.  Senator Malcolm.  Chief Justice POLLARD, whose
               face reveals nothing.  Vice-President ALMER, whose tongue
               darts across his dry lips unsettlingly.  Unpleasant looking
               men in an unpleasant mood.

               Cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares
               at Witwer.

 CIA CRONIN                          The central question is: Why does
                         Anderson want to kill Witwer?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42. 

               Cronin holds up the printout.

 CIA CRONIN (CONT'D)                          We checked your finances.  His
                         finances.  Nothing irregular, you
                         don't steal from him, he doesn't
                         steal from you.  You haven't done
                         anything that he might have
                         discovered, and vice versa.

               Swanson holds up another sheath of papers.

 FBI SWANSON                          Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
                         coups planned by you to topple him.
                              (beat)
                         He's done nothing to you, or you to
                         him.

               Witwer presses his lips together.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          You fucking his wife?

 WITWER                          No.

 FBI SWANSON HIS MOTHER? HIS BROTHER? 
               Witwer gives him a bad look.

 FBI SWANSON (CONT'D)                          Okay.  There we are.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          So, you are friends, partners, and
                         soul mates.  Anderson has no motive.

 WITWER                          I can't think of one.
                              (beat)
                         Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
                         are mistaken?

               Witwer looks away.  Jesus, he wants out of this room.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You don't believe that, do you?

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         No.  The Precogs are infallible.

               Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43. 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen
                         -screw the motive.  We got a
                         pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty
                         little PR problem.

               The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And here is our solution.  You are
                         now Director Witwer.

               Witwer shakes his head, starts to protest.  Almer silences
               him with a raised finger.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONT'D)                          Precrime must demonstrate its
                         willingness to go after one of its
                         own.  Total impartiality.

 WITWER                          Now look--

               Cronin talks right over him.

 CIA CRONIN                          The public must believe that every
                         future murderer is pursued with equal
                         vigor.

 FBI SWANSON                          Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
                         the man best suited to the job.  And
                         who would pursue a murderer harder
                         ... than his intended victim?

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You went after Anderson yesterday
                         -because it was right, and because
                         you believe.

               Almer speaks with a tight irony.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And your belief will certainly grow
                         stronger with each tick of the clock.

               Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred.  But he
               does not deny their words.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          Haw long will it take, Director?

               Wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the
               task he can't avoid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44. 

 WITWER                          He knows Precrime, of course.  And
                         the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll
                         remember how to work them.  It'll
                         come back to him fast.  He's ... the
                         best.

               Witwer almost smiles.  Justice Pollard's not smiling.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          We're not here to praise Caesar --
                         we're here to bury him.

               Witwer looks at Pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his
               right eye.

 WITWER                          He can't avoid iris identification.
                         Every door he opens, every ATM he
                         uses, or taxi or transport he boards
                         -- he'll get scanned.
                              (quietly)
                         It won't take long to find him.  

	       The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL NIGHT 
               The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all
               feels different than it did in the suburbs.  Where the burbs
               were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy.

               The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them.
               The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's
               suits have some shine at the elbows.  You look over your
               shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less.

               And some streets you don't go on at all.  Anderson's Python
               moves down one of them.  He stops under a blackened suspension
               bridge, gets out.  He's still in uniform.  He holds a duffel
               bag.

               He starts to walk away from the Python, then hesitates.
               He's left the door open.  He shakes his head at his
               sloppiness.  Goes back and shuts the door.  Walks away again.

 INSIDE THE CAR 
               He's left a small DEVICE on the passenger's seat.  Digital
               numbers shoot by in reverse.  Something CLICKS.

 OUTSIDE THE CAR 
               Anderson continues walking away.  He doesn't look back as
               the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame.
               It's not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesn't explode.
               It just ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 45. 

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS - -- NIGHT LATER 
               Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and
               dresses hanging in clear plastic bags.  He gets to work on
               the door.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
               Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark.  She listens to an
               almost inaudible sound, a high WHINE.

 EXT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE 
               A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house, a dark
               moon in the low clouds.

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS -- EARLY MORNING 
               A worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the
               clean clothes piled on the floor.  It almost looks like a
               nest, like someone slept there

 EXT. SUBWAY LATER 
               Anderson, in a blue suit and fedora, carrying his duffel
               bag, stands on a subway platform.  He takes out a cell phone,
               dials a number.  He looks up at the SOUND of a train.

               The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front
               car: "33rd Street Express."

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer moves up and down the aisles,
               past technicians who man computers and holographic tracking
               displays.

               A Precrime TECHNICIAN 1 suddenly sits upright.  Witwer picks
               him out of the crowd and zeroes in.

 TECHNICIAN                          It's Anderson.

               Witwer grabs a phone, punches a button

 WITWER                          Paul! 
                The technicians scramble to pinpoint Anderson on a
               Glowing holographic MAP.

               Another TECHNICIAN 2 calls out to Witwer.  Witwer covers his

 ANDERSON                          Why am I going to kill you,Ed?

 INTERCUT:ANDERSON ON THE SUBWAY /WITWER AT PRECRIME 
 WITWER                          There's no motive

 ANDERSON                          My wife calling you before breakfast?

 WITWER                          We were planning a surprise party.
                         It was going to be today.
                              (beat, ironic)
                         Happy birthday, partner.

 ANDERSON                          This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell
                         of a surprise, though.
                              (beat)
                         I'm having trouble trusting people,
                         Ed, I gotta tell you.

               At Precrime, they upload a MAP DISPLAY of the Express train's
               route.  We see a blue light moving -- the train.  And two
               separate red dots along its route.

               An OFFICER points at the dots, and speaks to Witwer in a low
               voice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 47. 

 OFFICER                          The train makes two stops, here and

 WITWER                          I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul .

 ANDERSON                          I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive.

 WITWER                          Come in.  We'll figure this thing

 ANDERSON                          I saw a news flash.  You're the new
                         Director.  Is that the point of this?

 WITWER                          Fuck you.

               Anderson smiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 48. 

 ANDERSON                          Didn't think so.  But it has to be
                         something, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the DISPLAY MAP.  We see the blue train
               nearing its first stop, 20th street.  We see two waves of
               lighted green dots -- Precrime units heading for 20th and
               33rd.

 WITWER                          Paul.  Come in.

               Anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train: "Next
               Stop 20th Street.

 ANDERSON                          If I come in, it puts me close to
                         you.  If I get close ... I may kill
                         you.  I can't risk that.
                              (beat)
                         Anyway, they'd force you to lock me
                         up.  And that'd be it -- I'd never
                         get my chance to solve this thing.

               Witwer needs to keep him talking

 WITWER                          You're kinds liking this, in a way,
                         aren't you?  The action ...

 ANDERSON                          And you get to be a real cop again.
                         We get to flex our muscles.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. 20TH STREET SUBWAY STATION 
               Precrime vehicles pull up.  Hovercrafts appear in the sky
               above.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. 20TH STREET SUBWAY STATION 
               Anderson's train is just finishing off-loading passengers.
               The doors close and the train begins to pull out as the first
               helmeted Precrime officers flood the platform.

               One of them points.

 CLOSE ON: A TRAIN WINDOW 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 49. 

               Anderson is visible through the window, talking on his cell
               phone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT.PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Witwer stares at the map.  The train has stopped at 20th
               street.  But Anderson's still talking.  He isn't getting off
               -- he's going on to 33rd Street, the last stop.

               Technician 2 presses his earphone close, listens, then calls
               over to Witwer.  Witwer covers his mouthpiece.

 TECHNICIAN 2                          We have visual verification -- he's
                         still on the train.

               Witwer gives him a thumb's up.  We STAY ON Witwer as he
               listens to Anderson, and watches his train move toward 33rd
               on the MAP.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I want to tell you something, partner.
                         You listening?

               Witwer nods.  Now the MAP shows all the Precrime units
               swarming toward the 33rd Street subway station.

 WITWER                          Yeah.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I gotta do this.  I have to figure
                         this thing out.
                              (beat)
                         But listen to me now.  If it was you
                         running, I'd come after you, Ed.

               Witwer stares at the MAP, at all the units he's sent after
               his friend.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          You're a cop.  And I'm a future
                         murderer.
                              (beat)
                         Do your job, Ed. Come after me hard.
                         Because, Jesus Christ, I wouldn't
                         sleep or eat until I had tracked you
                         down and put a gun to your head.

 EXT. 33RD STREET SUBWAY 
               Precrime officers pour down the stairs toward the train
               platform.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Witwer watches on the MAP at all the little symbols merging
               together, like a gameboard -- but this game ends in a reallife
               confrontation between one man and an army of them.

 WITWER                          You wouldn't shoot a cop would you,
                         Paul?
                              (beat)
                         Paul?  Paul? 

	       He looks urgently to the phone technician

 TECHNICIAN 1                          He's still on the line.

               Witwer presses his ear to the phone.  He can hear the subway
               make its STOP.  Then he hears a chorus of mechanized VOICES
               -the voices of the Precrime police, the SCREAMS of panicked
               passengers

 VOICES ON ANDERSON'S PHONE                          Police.  Everyone down on your hands
                         and knees!
                              (then)
                         Oh, shit.

 CUT TO: 
 INT.SUBWAY TRAIN 
               The Precrime officers aim the index barrels of their
               gloveweapons at ANDERSON, who sits blithely on a seat, holding
               his cell phone to his ear.

               Anderson begins to shimmer, then dematerialize ghost-like,
               into nothingness.  He was a holographic decoy.

               What is actually there on the train seat is Anderson's cell
               phone.  Rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice
               recorder.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. 20TH STREET SUBWAY 
               Anderson trots up the stairs and safely out onto the streets
               of The Sprawl.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 51. 

 EXT. STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 


               Every city has its underbelly.  If you lifted the fat dark
               underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up.

               The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight.  There
               are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its
               source, never makes it through the sour air down to the
               ground.

               The retro fifties look comes apart here.  The people that
               you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they
               move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting
               tech-fibers.

               ANDERSON'S caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black.
               Anderson has him pinned up against a wall.  They're having
               some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering
               none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder
               against the wall.

               Finally, the guy does something odd.  He lifts a finger and
               pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid.  Anderson lets
               him.  Then the guy does the same on the left.  Has a long
               look.  And then nods.  Anderson releases him, and they go
               off together.

 EXT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER 
               An oppressive brick thing on a side street.  The facade is
               crumbling.  Nothing good happens in a building like this..

               The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off
               into the night.

 INT. ROOM -- LATER 
               A stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little
               kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink.

               But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift
               hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array
               of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia
               console.

               Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC.  DOC is a big man with
               delicate fingers.  He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into
               a handkerchief.

 DOC                          Got a cold.

               Anderson looks at him uneasily.  It's not just DOC -- it's
               the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing,
               which Anderson truly does not care for.  Doc sneezes again,
               then looks up at his patient.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          Don't worry.  I could cut open your
                         chest, sew a dead cat in there, and
                         you'd never get an infection.  Not
                         with the spectrum antibios I'll be
                         shooting into you.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.

               Doc chuckles.  Then he waits, expectantly.

               Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card.  A preset cash
               card.  DOC slides it into small console, watches the numbers
               flash up.  He frowns, sighs.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          It's all I could safely move

               He waits.  Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.

 DOC                          Yeah.  All right.

               Time to got down to business.  Doc walks over to a large
               medical cabinet and opens the door.  It's full of EYES, and
               parts of eyes -- 611 !  A cryo-jars.

               Anderson tightens.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          You understand what I told you then.
                         I can't just give you new irises.
                         The Scanners will read the scar
                         tissue.  Alarms will go off.

 ANDERSOIN                          I'm a cop, I know

 DOC                          I gotta take your eyes out.

               Anderson knows this, too, wishes Doc would shut up ANDERSON
               Yeah.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          And put in new ones.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  I get it, DOC.

               Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the
               operating table.  He lies down.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Do me quick before I run out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. 

               Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling.  He listens
               to Doc preparing instrument trays.  It's a bad sound.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the
               Python transport.  Witwer stands watching as a Precrime
               techno-unit sifts through the white ashes.

               Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the
               Potomac.  It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing
               the air for a scent.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see
               anything either.  He's in a deep post-surgical haze.  DOC'S
               voice comes to him.  It's warped and ugly.

 DOC'S VOICE                          Don't take the bandages off for twenty
                         four hours.  You'll go blind if you
                         do.

               Anderson makes an affirmative grunt. Now we see his
               surroundings, even though Anderson still can't.  He lies in
               a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings.
               Doc stands over him.

 DOC                          You're in a room.  I had you moved
                         here, a couple miles from my place.
                         If they find you, they don't find
                         me.

               Anderson grunts weakly.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          A guy will come in, feed you once.
                              (beat)
                         I juiced up the nano-reconstruction
                         around your new eyes, 'cause I know
                         you're in a hurry.

 ANDERSON                               (Fuzzily))
                         Nano-re ...construction.

 DOC                          Organic microrobots that reconstruct
                         nerves and blood vessels.  It'll
                         feel like fleas chewing on your
                         eyeballs.  Don't scratch.

               Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages.
               Doc forces them away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm giving you a bonus, might come
                         in handy.  Feel this.

               Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to
               Anderson's hand.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          It's a temporary paralytic enzyme.
                         Someone spots you, you duck into an
                         alley, shoot this under your chin.

               Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's
               chin.  Anderson jumps.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          The enzyme turns your facial muscles
                         to mush.  You won't look like the
                         same man.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus.

 DOC                          You tighten up again in about thirty
                         minutes.  Hurts like nothing you
                         ever felt.  It's vicious, but
                         effective.  I'll put it in your bag.

               Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places
               it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm setting up a timer.  When it
                         buzzes tomorrow, take off your
                         bandages, and get the hell out of
                         here.

               Anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he
               hears a door open and close, and Doc is gone.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               The Precrime presence mounts on the streets.  A couple of
               units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold.
               He looks like a hostage.  He is sweating.  Keeps reaching
               for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to.

               He speaks to someone we don't yet see.  The guy DOC said
               would come.

 ANDERSON                          I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Guess I should eat.  
				(Beat) 
			 You gonna help feed me?

               Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent
               to help Anderson.  It's the rat guy, the thin bald man
               Anderson had roughed up the day before.  The guy has a bowl
               of hot soup in his hands.  He stares contemptuously at
               Anderson.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          So how do we do this, pal?

               The rat guy doesn't say a word.  He simply tips the hot soup
               and it splatters down into Anderson's lap.  Anderson cries
               out in pain and surprise.  The guy walks out of the room.

 CLOSE ON- THE TIMER 
               Twenty hours gone by.  Four more to go.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch,
               looking for leads, looking for anything.

 INT. THE BOARDING ROOM 
               The TIMER shows one hour to go.  Anderson sits in a chair,
               squirming miserably.  His dressings are wet with sweat, and
               frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked
               at them.

 ANDERSON                               (to himself)
                         Fuck.

               He is this close to ripping the dressings off

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY 
               A Precrime transport stops.  Two officers get out.  One of
               them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and
               does a read on the boarding house.  The other does a read on
               a pawn shop and bar next door..

               The OFFICER 1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the
               other officer.

 OFFICER 1                          Got 27 warm bodies in this place.
                         What should it take, three or four
                         Spiders?

 OFFICER 2                          Do four.  Speed things up, so we can
                         go eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. 

               The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport, and takes out
               a box.  He removes four round BALLS.  They are silver, as
               big as billiard balls.

               He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and
               the front door opens.  He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.

               Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against
               it, bored.  He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits
               for the data to come in.

 INT. THE BUILDING 
               The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to
               autolife as they spin.  They open like flowers -- flowers
               with legs.

 CLOSE ON : A BALL 
               A fist-sized Spider takes shape.  On its head is an IdentiScan
               lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna.

 INT. A ROOM 
               An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something
               unidentifiable.  She looks up with annoyance as she sees a
               spider scuttling across the floor toward her.  It makes a
               CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes.  She's poor, living
               in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill.  She continues to eat
               as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table.  She barely
               watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand.

 OLD WOMAN                          It's nice to have a little company

               She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her
               am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder.  It grips
               her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes.

               Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away
               across the linoleum.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column
               with his laser pen, and waits for the next one.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson sits in his chair.  He cocks his head, listening.
               His body tenses.  Something feels wrong.

               The TIMER shows ten minutes to go.  Blindfolded for a day
               and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left.
               Three seconds, four hours?

               A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door.  Anderson tenses
               as it CLICKS across the floor toward him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. 

               He knows that sound.

               Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair.  He starts to
               grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops
               himself.  The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS
               toward him again.

               Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider.  He is
               dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.  The Spider
               comes faster.  Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down.
               Falls across the bed.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard.  One of the Spiders
               is taking too long.  He adjusts his thermal scanner, and
               sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room.

               The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the
               barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1. They both watch the
               screen.

 OFFICER 1                          Stinking drunk.

 OFFICER 2                               (beat)
                         Or a guy who doesn't want to get
                         read.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the
               consequences.  The Spider advances, starts up his leg.

               The TIMER has not buzzed.  Anderson can't touch his dressings.
               The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face.  It
               WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the
               dressings.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their
               mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get
               past the dressings for a read.

               Anderson has no choice.  None.  He starts to lift at his
               dressing.  The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in
               place.

               Anderson wants to scream.  He unwraps his head, tugs the eye
               pads away from his eyes.  He rips them off.  The Spider sits
               on his shoulder, waiting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. 

               Anderson's eyes are tightly closed.  He opens them

 ANDERSON'S POV - BLINDING LIGHT 
               Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear
               flashpoint.  Light to buckle the knees and push the brain
               beyond endurance.

               And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off.
               The TIMER has finally sounded.  Anderson's open eyes are
               streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE ROOM 
               It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his
               eyes.  Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps
               off his shoulder, and crosses the floor.  It flattens, scoots
               under the door, and is gone.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read.  They
               pull off their helmets.

 OFFICER 1                          Let's eat.

               They start putting their equipment back into the transport.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror.  His new eyes
               are tender and bloodshot.  And they are not blue, like the
               ones he was born with, but a deep brown.  Anderson is exactly
               the same, and utterly different.

               He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTER'S -- DAY 
               Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office.
               Witwer isn't looking too well, either.

 WITWER                          They told me to move into Paul's
                         office.  I said fuck you very much.

               Lisa nods.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (softly)
                         I don't want to do any of this, Lisa.

 LISA                          I know.  I know that.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Everybody's got their reasons for
                         wanting you in charge.  So do I --
                         you won't bring him in dead.

 WITWER                          Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ...
                              (beat)
                         Which is what he does four days from
                         now, isn't it?

               Witwer's eyes imp involuntarily to a CLOCK on his desk.

 LISA                          He'd never hurt you.

 WITWER                          I know that.  But the other thing I
                         know is -- the Precogs are never
                         wrong.

               The words are leading them no place good.  They stop talking,
               and just sit there.

 INT. THE SPRAWL 
               Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with
               several people waiting for the N0.6 Turbo Tram.

               The double decker Tram comes.  People get off, then the line
               starts to move forward as people get on.

               Anderson fidgets.  He's last in line.  Each person gets
               IdentiScanned as he boards.  Anderson's putting his new eyes
               to the test.  If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself
               to run.

               The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare.
               Anderson's turn.  Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam
               reads his eyes.

               The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering
               wheel, then nods at him.

 DRIVER                          Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty
                         of seats in the back.

               Anderson nods, moves casually to the back.  But his jaw
               muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension.

 INT. A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT 
               Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he
               finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den.  He
               wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos
               adorning the cherry wood walls.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60. 

               He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford
               to.  No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors.
               No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary
               or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand.

               Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small
               SOUND at ear level, coming from just behind him.  It's a
               metallic CLICK-CLICK.  He turns amiably.  His eyes instantly
               widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into
               the barrel of ANDERSON'S cocked gun.

 ANDERSON                          Time to upgrade your alarm system,
                         Senator.

               Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure.  His fear
               embarrasses him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Your work-up of Witwer.  The Security
                         Panel would've done one.
                              (beat)
                         Why do I kill Witwer?

               The Senator finds his voice.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          There's no motive.

 ANDERSON                          There's, always a motive.

               Anderson presses the gun to the Senator's forehead.  He slides
               the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty
               skin.  It makes a greasy red mark.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I could've come to anyone on the
                         panel.  But I picked you.
                              (beat)
                         Of all the shits on that panel, I
                         like you least of all.  So if this
                         gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but
                         not, you know, devastated.

               You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm.

               And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns
               and walks to the other side of the den.  His tone is mocking.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          What the fuck was I worried about?
                         You can't kill me.  The Precogs
                         would've seen it.

               Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun.  The Senator is
               even laughing now.  For a moment Anderson does nothing, then
               he moves toward the Senator again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61. 

               The Senator stands his ground smugly.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Witwer's clean.  You're clean.
                         There's nothing.  No motive.  Kind
                         of like something Kafka would've
                         cooked up.
                              (beat)
                         You like that, cockroach?  You're
                         fucked and you'll never know why.

               The Senator is laughing hard now.  Anderson lets him.

 ANDERSON                          Tell you something about the Precogs,
                         Senator.  They're great on murder.
                         But it's the little things they fail
                         to see.

               Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the
               floor and into the cherry wood panelling.  Several of his
               beloved photos crash down onto him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Little things like that, for instance.

               Anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer stands there amidst all of
               the technology speaking to a group of Precrime officers.

 WITWER                          He hasn't shown up on one goddamn
                         IdentiScan in three days.

               No one says anything, and then LIEUTENANT GLASER, 30, speaks
               up.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          He's found a room -- he's going to
                         sit it out.

 WITWER                          Yeah, except for holding a gun to
                         senator Malcolm's goddman head in
                         his own goddman house last night,
                         Anderson's sitting it out!
                              (beat)
                         Why hasn't he been scanned?

               The officers look at their shoes.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Why is he invisible?  He's moving
                         around but he isn't being seen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62. 

               Lieutenant Glaser tries again.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Hes beating the scanners

 WITWER                          No one beats the scanners.

               Witwer reaches up, wearily, rubbing his face and eyes with
               his hands.  The fingers dragging across his eyes stop.  Then
               his hands drop away, and he looks at his men.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's done his eyes

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          But the scarring always

 WITWER                          He went the whole way.  The crazy
                         bastard had his eyes removed.  New
                         ones sewn in.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          That takes weeks to heal.

 WITWER                          If you're prepared to go blind, a
                         street surgeon'll juice up the repair
                         cycle.  They don't give a fuck about
                         risk.

               Witwer's eyes flick to a digital CLOCK on the wall.  It's
               something he can't help doing now.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's going to do what it takes to
                         stay free -- if it blinds him, maims
                         him, or kills him.

               Witwers admiring smile makes his men very uncomfortable .

 INT. KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY 
               A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her
               teenage son.  He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts
               the carton down in front of him.

               There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton,
               about the size of a playing card.  AS the sleepy kid watches,
               the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life.

               Nothing unusual, they always do that.  For advertisements,
               lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins.

               A good one.  The kid straightens up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 63. 

 THE VID-SCREEN 
               A fully rotating mug shot of PAUL ANDERSON fills the screen,
               followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime
               he's been charged with.

               The kid watches for a while, then gets bored, and pulls the
               Dexi-Pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of
               that.

 INT. A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn
               perched on his belly.  He stares at a TV monitor that's the
               size of a twin bed.

 TV 
               Anderson's face fills the monitor.  The TV image is so big
               that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence.
               It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to
               avoid Him you can't.

               The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that.  He surfs
               through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is
               omnipresent.

 EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson's face fills the skies, too.  Witwer and Precrime
               have pulled out all the stops.

               Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it.
               Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air.  There
               are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the
               weather, a special type of cloud.

               People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go
               about their business.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL 
               One person who is paying deep attention to all this is
               Anderson himself.  He stands on a street corner, wearing
               dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk.

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a
               Precrime SPOKESWOMAN.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          The United States Supreme Court has
                         issued a special injunction allowing
                         the unprecedented public viewing of
                         former Precrime Director Paul
                         Anderson's future murder of Edward
                         Witwer, the current Director.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. 

 ANDERSON                          His mouth slowly opens.  He steps
                         back against a wall and slides his
                         hand into his pants pocket.  He looks
                         at the Precog DISC in his cupped
                         hand, then quickly puts it away.

               He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather
               around excitedly.

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky, in store windows, at
               other video kiosks.  They have the enthralled anticipation
               of a mob at a public guillotining.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          She continues her declamation

 SPOKESWOMAN (CONT'D)                          The video you are about to see,
                         generated by the Precognitive mutants,
                         is the immutable evidence of the
                         infallible system.
                              (reassuring smile)
                         Citizens are urged to call
                         1-800-PRECRIME with any information
                         that may lead us to the whereabouts
                         of Paul Anderson, future murderer.

 ANDERSON                          Shakes his head in confusion and
                         disbelief.  But he has the Precog
                         disc ...

               The OLD GUY him nudges him

 OLD GUY                          This oughtta be good, huh?

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing
               guns at each other.  The whole thing just as we saw it before.
               All the way through to the fatal moment.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

               Anderson shoots him.  Witwer slumps, dying.  The video stops.
               And then begins to play all over again, right from the start,
               the 1-800-PRECRIME number scrolling along the bottom of it.
               "Call now!  Call now!  Call now!

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Moves quickly through the crowds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 65. 

 INT. BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so
               full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting
               life.  But it supports the kind of life Page is interested
               in.

               An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool
               beside Page.  He gives one shake of his head, and she slides
               away again.  His eyes cut to a group of females.  He waits
               for the next approach.

 CLOSE ON: PAGE 
               as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc
               on the bar in front of him.  Page makes a sound and tries to
               jump away, as if the disc is something lethal.  Which it is,
               in a way.

               Anderson presses him back down on his stool.  Sits next to
               him.  Page stares at him, scared.  Anderson looks straight
               ahead as he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          "Ennis Page engages the services of
                         prostitutes because his relationships
                         with them compound his feelings of
                         selfloathing."
                              (beat)
                         Direct quote from your psychological
                         profile -- the kind of shit I had to
                         know as your former boss.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          "Page is an obsessive-compulsive
                         Type Nine." Another quote.  Niners
                         are great for the kind of work you
                         do -- keeping all those Precog discs
                         in order.

               You can almost see Page's heart slamming in his chest.  He
               tries to hide it with tough talk.

 PAGE                          I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so
                         what?

 ANDERSON                          Something's out of order, Ennis.
                         Deeply out of order.

               Page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar PAGE You got a
               disc Anderson picks it up, holds it tight in his fist

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Not A disc.  The disc.  When I went
                         home sick, I stole it.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 66. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I took it with me, Ennis.  I wasn't
                         sick, I was running with the evidence.
                              (lets that sink in)
                         So how is it that Precrime has one,
                         too?

 PAGE                               (utterly baffled)
                         You can't make copies 

	       Anderson waits.  Lets Page work through it.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          It's the basis of the system.  The
                         immutable evidence.  Copies are
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         You went home.  A little later, I
                         came in with a disc for Mr. Witwer
                         to review.  I wasn't halfway out the
                         door when he cried out.

               Anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          He was in shock.  He showed me.  It
                         was you shooting him.  Then all hell
                         broke loose.  He had to send the
                         Precrime units to your house.

 ANDERSON                          Ennis -- you gave out the same disc
                         twice.  Less than an hour apart.
                         The one I stole.  And then another
                         one.  Of the same event.

 PAGE                          It's impossible.  The Precogs can
                         only move forward to new events.
                         Into the future.  They never repeat.

               Anderson looks around.  Patrons are beginning to look over
               in his direction, eyes lingering.  He rises.

               Page seems in a daze.  As an obsessive-compulsive niner, the
               concept of an untidy system is disorienting.

               Anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't.

               On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned.  An automatic
               DIGITAL VOICE calls out after him.

 DIGITAL VOICE                          Have a nice night, Mr. Symington

	       Anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of The Sprawl.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 67. 

 INT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A YOUNG GUY with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone.
               He picks up, the receiver and immediately gets IdentiScanned.
               A light goes on, he's about to dial.

               Anderson appears out of nowhere, shoulders him out of the
               way.  The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back
               onto the sidewalk.  Anderson grabs the hanging receiver.

 YOUNG GUY                          Hey!  Hey, you can't... 

	       He reaches for Anderson, then thinks better of it.  Anderson 
	       is twice his size and very menacing in dark glasses.

 YOUNG GUY (CONT'D)                          I'm gettin' a cop.

               The guy scurries off.  Anderson dials quickly.

 INTERCUT ANDERSON/LISAS OFFICE 
               Lisa, walking down a hallway in the Judicial Center, stops
               to answer her BEEPING cell phone.  She leans against a wall,
               as lawyers and judges pass by.

 ANDERSON                          It's me.

 LISA                          Paul.

               Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall

 ANDERSON                          Your phone will be bugged.  So we
                         can't meet, we can't do anything.
                         Just listen.  Nowing you're listening
                         is enough.

               Lisa nods, as if he's right there.  He is right there, for
               her.  This is all she's got.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When Precrime stormed the house, I
                         thought you'd called them.  Betrayed
                         me.

 LISA                          No.

 ANDERSON                          I know.  Witwer sent them.  He saw
                         the disc and had to do his job.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me you forgive me.  Please.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68. 

 LISA                          Of course, I forgive you.

               There's no time left.  He has to get off the line and start
               moving again.  A vast weariness enters his voice.

 ANDERSON                          All these people I need to forgive
                         me.
                              (beat)
                         Do you think Frank forgave me?  All
                         I could do for him was send him
                         gardenias.
                              (long beat)
                         I love you.

               Lisa almost cries out when he hangs up.  She flattens herself
               against a wall.  She stays like that for a long moment,
               pulling the sound of her husband's voice, his words, deep
               inside of herself.

               And then she gets a look, as one of those words registers
               profoundly.

 LISA                               (whispers to herself)
                         Frank hated gardenias.

 EXT. EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER 
               A public cemetery along the Potomac.  There's not much land
               left for new graves.  A funeral is taking place.  A lot of
               mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses.  The service is
               nearing its end.

               Frank D'Ignazio's newly dug grave is nearby.  Lisa stands
               there, looking at the temporary marker, and the flowers and
               wreaths piled up against it.

               Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground.

               High in the sky, a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT, everpresent in Lisa's
               life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE.

               Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers.
               Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH.  There is a
               small envelope tucked beneath a blossom.  She takes it.

               Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car.

               The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing
               dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars.

               One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa.  She looks up and he
               tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over
               them at her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 69. 

               It's Anderson.  Isn't it?  She looks into his eyes.  And
               it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now.
               But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for
               him.  Knows she can't.

               He's already moving on.  He's risked everything for a look.
               He slips into the black sea of mourners, she goes to her car
               -neither of them ever breaking stride.

               The Precrime craft hovers, unaware

 INT. LISA'S CAR 
               Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the
               Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay.

               A Precog DISC falls into her hand.  Her mouth opens -- she's
               never held one before.

               And there is a NOTE with it It READS:

               "The Precogs generated duplicate discs.  This is the first.
               Precrime has the second.  Duplicates.  Why?"

 EXT. A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run.  He
               gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to
               drink.

               He waits in line.  He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting.
               The woman ahead of him argues about change.  He presses his
               lips together.

               And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera
               DOME attached to the ceiling.  It gives him a fish eye
               reflected VIEW of what's happening behind him.

               Precrime police are happening behind him.  He doesn't stop
               to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store.

               Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the
               clerk to the floor.

 INT. BACK ROOM 
               Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can.  He hears the
               mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling
               from the store.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson crashes out into an alley, and clambers up a fence.
               SONIC BLASTS shatter the air around him.  Chunks of brick
               fly off the walls on both sides.  But he is full of
               adrenaline, and there is no stopping him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 70. 

 INT. A TURBOTRAM - THE SPRAWL -- LATER 
               A different part of the city.  Anderson hunkers low in the
               back seat of a tram.

               He looks up, as the DRIVER swears

 DRIVER                          What the hell --

               Anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the
               windshield.  Precrime transports are heading straight at the
               tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue.

               They've even taken radio control of the P.A. system on the
               tram.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson can't believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing
               him?  The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare
               at him, terrified.

               Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit
               doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.

               He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into
               his bag for a glove.  He pulls the weapon onto his right
               hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.

               Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the
               street.  He looks up.  He is surrounded by skyscrapers and
               buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban
               canyon.

               People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into
               doorways where they can.  Passengers in trans and taxis or
               cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching.

               Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in.
               The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically
               altered VOICE.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Lower your weapon, or we will
                         neutralize your threat potential.

               The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing
               at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men.

               Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building
               closest to him.

 ANDERSON'S POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT 
               The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71. 

               Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward
               it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Do not move!

               Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the
               building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.

               He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing.
               It is a moment for prayer.  Anderson doesn't have a moment.

               He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at
               the sidewalk.  The effect on the underground water main is
               immediate.

               A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up
               from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen
               feet into the air right alongside the building.

               The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's
               bouncing at the top of the geyser.  And they can't fire,
               anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement
               from every window in the building.

               All this in a time span of seconds.  The world spins crazily
               for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support
               beam holding the building's sign, one story up.

               The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of
               water from the water main break obscures his moves.

               He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along
               it toward a second story window.  The office building gawkers
               lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to
               sparkling dust and leaps inside.

 INT. OFFICE BUILDING 
               The building covers almost an entire city block.  Anderson,
               dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting
               through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.

               He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,
               jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever
               he must to get to his goal.

               And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the
               avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime
               ambushed him.

               He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream
               of traffic.  It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.

               Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of
               the bus.  It is a bone-jarring landing.  He loses
               consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,
               and slides off it onto the pavement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72. 

               He lies there, trying to rouse himself.  Traffic brakes to a
               stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in
               the road.  No one wants to touch him.  A single car horn
               SOUNDS, and then a chorus of them.

               Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a
               limping run.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION LATER 
               Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at
               the far end of the passenger platform.  There are tracks on
               either side of him, one marked "Uptown" and the other
               "Downtown. "

               He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that
               the Downtown train is coming in.  And on his left, too, the
               Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view.

               Which MagLev train will lead him to safety?  Which one won't
               they pinpoint?  He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm
               around his girlfriend.  They step back, startled.  He's got
               a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle
               shoes.

               The trains pull in.

 ANDERSON                          Pick one for me!

 KID                          What?

 THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY 
 ANDERSON                          Point to the train I should take.
                         Please.

 KID                          I don't know.

               The girl lifts a nervous finger and points.  The Uptown.  He
               runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to
               the Downtown.

 INT. SUBWAY CAR 
               He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the
               dark rush by.  A train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible
               they could find him.

               A station Stop.  He starts to get off, is actually on the
               platform, then steps back onto the train.

               The rushing dark again.  When the MagLev eases to a halt at
               the next station he gets off this time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73. 

 INT. STATION 
               He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people.
               He eases back and lets them go up first.

 THE STAIRS 
               Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching
               people out of the way as they come into view.  They wait
               -but Anderson does not come.  And he does not come.

               On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.

 DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS 
               ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling,
               adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE OFFICERS 
               as they run below him down the stairs.  They go out of sight,
               he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for
               him.

               The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him.  He reaches
               up.  With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve,
               releasing himself from the glob.  He drops to the stairs,
               and instantly slips up them.

               He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend.  He
               slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds
               the laser knife against his throat.

               The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified.  He speaks hoarsely through
               Anderson's choking grip.

 OFFICER                          Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please.

               Anderson looks at the panicked officer.  Anderson closes his
               eyes trying to put it together.  He opens them.

 ANDERSON                          But the Precogs would've predicted
                         me killing you.  You'd know whether
                         I do or not.

               The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy.
               Anderson suddenly gets it.  He tightens his grip on the man.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          They shut down the system.  Haven't
                         they?  They've shut down the Precogs.

               The officer nods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 74. 

 OFFICER                          They're off homicides.  They're
                         redirecting them to help us locate
                         you.

               Which is how they knew where he'd be every time.

               Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull,
               knocking him out.  And then he runs, because what else can
               he do?

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled:
               COURTROOM 17.  She holds a briefcase in one hand.  Down the
               hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one.  She
               enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17.

 INT. COURTROOM 17 
               Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom.  The
               lights are dim.

               She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase.
               She turns it on.

 TV 
               The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and
               over in a continuous loop.  Flashing at the bottom is the
               hotline number: "1-800-PRECRIME." Then- "Call Now!  Call
               Now!

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the
               first disc.

               She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench.

               The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side.  The tv
               plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the
               judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.

               She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from
               one version to the other.  They seem absolutely identical.
               When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.

               Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend,
               endlessly.

 EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY 
               A gas station right out of the fifties.  An attendant in a
               uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield
               of a sky blue Rambler.

               In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75. 

 INT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               Anderson looks at himself in the mirror.  He reaches out and
               touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown.  It is
               still startling to him, the color of his eyes.

               Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air
               syringe Doc gave to him.  He looks at it nervously.  It is
               filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid.

               He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin.
               He closes his eyes.  Then he screws up his courage, and hits
               the plunger.  The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a
               searing HISS.

               Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall
               of the bathroom.  His hands reach up for his face -- which
               looks like it's boiling from within.

 ANDERSON'S FACE 
               The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker.  The muscle tone
               around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old
               man's.  That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years.
               His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop.  Healthy
               pink is replaced by bloodless gray.

 AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT 
 EXT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door

 ATTENDANT                          You all right in there?

               When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a
               fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom.
               Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches
               after him uncertainly as he wanders off.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around
               the headquarters.  There may be a massive campaign to find
               Anderson, but the Precrime public relations machine continues
               to run without interruption.

               There are ten people in the group, and the physically
               transformed Anderson is among them.  They all wear glowing
               nametags.  Anderson's reads, "Mr. Symington." He keeps his
               hands in his pockets, and his head low.

               We have heard the tour guide's spiel before

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 76. 

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               She is about to go on when she looks over at Anderson.  He
               is fidgeting uncomfortably.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Are you ... all right, Mr. Symington?

               Anderson moves up close to her, a little too close.  He
               whispers to her, embarrassed.  She gives him a professional
               smile, and points in the distance past the elevators.

               Anderson nods, and heads off.  She calls after him.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          We'll wait right here for you, sir!

 INT. A STAIRWELL 
	       Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor.

 INT. A BASEMENT CORRIDOR 
               Anderson stands outside a door marked: "Housekeeping." Above
               the doorway is an IdentiScan device.

               Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small
               cryo-jar.

 CLOSE ON: THE CRYO-JAR 
               Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs
               -the irises a luminous blue.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND -- MOMENTS LATER 
               The operations room in Precrime.  The technicians sit at
               their computers and holographic tracking displays.

               Witwer paces among them.  His eyes keep flicking to the
               digital clock on the wall.  Then they cut back to the men
               and machines that are telling him nothing.  Witwer does not
               look well at all, When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his
               computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get
               to him.  He looks over the man's shoulder.

 WITWER                          What is it?

 TECHNICIAN                          Must be a glitch ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77. 

 WITWER                          What?

 TECHNICIAN                          Anderson just got IdentiScanned.

               Witwer grips the back of the technician's chair.  The
               technician types the data through again.

 TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)                          It's him -- he's been scanned.

 WITWER                          Where is he?

               The technician looks up at Witwer.

 TECHNICIAN                          But he's had his eyes done.  Right?
                         Sir?  Tries to think it through.

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         He had to have.

               The technician's computer flashes the next piece of
               information.  When he speaks, it's the last thing Witwer
               wants to hear.

 TECHNICIAN                          Jesus Christ, sir.  He's in the
                         basement of this building.

               All eyes turn to Witwer.  The unspoken question hangs in the
               air.  Anderson's come to murder Witwer?

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Throughout the building, every available Precrime Officer
               begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Four officers stand guard in the chamber.  They listen to
               the orders coming in on their earpieces.  Three of the guards
               rush out of the room, one stays behind.

               The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the female
               in the middle, the males on either side of her.  Their eyes
               are open ... and they are deeply alert.

               Two technicians tend to the Precogs.  At the back of the
               chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sitting
               at the huge mainframe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78. 

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               A ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around
               Witwer.  Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all.

 WITWER                          This is ridiculous.

               Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Standing orders from the Security
                         Panel, sir.

 WITWER                          If he wants to get to me, he'll get
                         to me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          No, he won't, sir.

               Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly.
               Then his eyes flick to the wall clock.

 INT. THE BASEMENT 
               Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors, conducting
               defensive searches of one room after another.  All they are
               coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three
               Precogs.  And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as
               the power is cut.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite
               flashlights.  The Search and Command room suddenly looks
               exceedingly vulnerable.

               A technician calls out from the darkness

 TECHNICIAN                          Don't worry, air -emergency generators
                         will kick on in five seconds.

               The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room
               seem alive with fireflies.  Five seconds go by.  Then ten
               more.

 WITWER                          Explanation, please!

 TECHNICIAN                          Uh, sir.  It seems ... he got the
                         generators, too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79. 

               There is a long moment of silence.  And then Witwer begins
               to laugh.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The room is utterly dark and silent.  The silence is broken
               by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor.  Somebody
               speaks, probably the guard.

 VOICE                          Shit.

               An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.
               And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporarily
               blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.
               Anderson stun guns them quickly.

               The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.
               We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features
               are returning to normal.

               He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is the
               equipment he is after.

               Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in
               horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the
               Precog helmets to the mainframe.

               Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing
               it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches into
               the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of
               blasts.

               Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a
               PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement is
               so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.

               A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes
               hold of his hand.

               Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him,
               is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her to
               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in
               their chairs.

               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair
               is silver white.  And when she speaks, her voice is like the
               wind whispering through time.

 FEMALE                          Save us, Anderson.

               Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully
               planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.

 ANDERSON                          I have to get out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80. 

               She grips his hand.

 FEMALE                          Save us.

               It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading.
               And her eyes, she won't let him go.  She is beginning to
               weaken, to sway on her feet.

               A sudden realization floods over Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          You let me get here, didn't you?
                         You stopped giving them information,
                         so they couldn't track me.

               The Precog female is fading fast.  She tries to reach out
               for him and her legs give way.

 FEMALE                          Save -- 
  	       And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls?  
	       What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the 
	       fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.

 INT. TUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen
               for over an hour.  The two versions of Anderson murdering
               Witwer play over and over.

 LISA                               (wearily, to herself)
                         Help me, Paul.

               She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment
               during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's FACE
               fills the screen.

               Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes.

               And it is his EYES, finally, that tell her everything.  Lisa's
               hand rises to her open mouth.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          They're blue.

               She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at
               the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800
               number scrolling along the bottom.

               When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen,
               she leans close to it and squints.

               Anderson stares right back at her.  And for the first time,
               Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical.  His
               eyes...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          And now they're brown.

               For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile.

 INT. PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters.  Witwer
               walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber.  EMT teams
               work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson
               has left in his wake.

               Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the
               brothers.  Their eyes are closed and they are limp.  Their
               lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other.

               Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is
               almost to himself.

 WITWER                          Why didn't the Precogs know he was
                         coming to do this?

               The Lieutenant has no reply.  Witwer runs both hands through
               his hair.  It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the
               clock ...

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The next time he shows up it'll be
                         to kill me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We won't let that happen, sir.

               Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the
               Lieutenant a withering look.

 WITWER                          You won't, huh?

               When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away
               and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs.  He
               stares at the Precogs.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (to a technician)
                         When can we get these things
                         operational?

 TECHNICIAN                          They're a hive mind, sir.  It takes
                         three for their predictive abilities
                         to be fully operational.

               Which Witwer does not want to hear.  Witwer leans very close
               to the technician.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. 

 WITWER                          These two are all I have to find the
                         man who is about to murder me.  Hook
                         them up, and flood them with whatever
                         kind of fucking chemicals you have
                         to.  They are a machine, and I need
                         that machine at my disposal.

               The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin
               their silent movements again.

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page is a man unglued.  He sits on a tidy little sofa,
               in a tidy 1950's style living room.  But his movements have
               become untidy.  He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue.

               When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his
               chin onto his shirt.  Not like Ennis, at all.

               When his doorbell RINGS, he slowly looks up, then looks down
               at the floor again.  He doesn't answer it.  It RINGS some
               more.

               And then Lisa is standing there before him

 LISA                          Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.  I
                         could just walk in here.

 PAGE                          I forgot.  To turn it on.

               She sits down beside him.

 LISA                          You don't look surprised to see me.

               She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside
               him, three gone.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          I need your help.

               Unexpectedly, tears well up in Ennis's eyes.

 PAGE                          He took one of my babies.

 LISA                          He's desperate, Ennis.  He had to.
                              (beat)
                         We have to help him.

               Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes.  He closes
               them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          It's a fake Ennis.

               Ennis's eyes open again.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This is the first disc.  You delivered
                         it to Director Anderson.  He reviewed
                         it.  And then he stole it, and went
                         on the run.

               Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze.  His words
               slur.

 PAGE                          I delivered ... a fake .. to him?

 LISA                          But he thought it was real, and ran
                         with it.

               The pills, his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing
               it.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          An hour later, you delivered a second
                         disc of the same event.  Witwer
                         reviewed it.  It was real.  (Beat)
                         How do I know this?

               Ennis just wants her to go away.  He wants it all to go away.
               Tears stream down his face.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Director Anderson had his eyes
                         changed.  They were blue.  Now he
                         has brown ones.

               Ennis is sliding away.  Lisa takes hold of him.  Makes him
               listen, dammit.  She points to the disc in her hand.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This disc, the fake one, shows a
                         blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer
                         two days from now.  He doesn't have
                         blue eyes anymore.  The person who
                         faked this disc had no idea he would
                         change his eyes.

               Lisa shakes him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Listen!  But the second disc has to
                         be real, because he has brown eyes
                         when he murders Witwer.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 84. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Somebody tried to frame him with a
                         fake.  And somehow it all became real.
                         Why, Ennis?  How could this happen?

               Ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of
               comprehension.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You handle the discs.  How did a
                         fake one get delivered?

               Ennis's eyes roll back into his head.

               PAGE Coffee ...

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You want-- ?

 PAGE                          He spilled coffee everywhere ...
                         Everywhere ...

 LISA                          What coffee?  What are you -- ?

               But Ennis sags unconscious.  She shakes him hard, even slaps
               him, but Ennis is out.  She lets him drop down on the sofa.

               From outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes
               the WHINE of a hovercraft.

               Lisa looks once more at Ennis, then gets out of there

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               A small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance.  Which
               is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a Precog.

               The female Precog lies on a cot.  Anderson sits on a metal
               folding chair watching her.

               Her eyes slowly open and look at him

 FEMALE                          My brothers aren't here.

 ANDERSON                          You didn't even look around.  You
                         knew.

 FEMALE                               (beat)
                         We can sense each other.  You must
                         save

	       Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85. 

 ANDERSON                          Stop.  I saved You.  It was the best
                         I could do.

               She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall.
               There is a fading pink cabbage rose.  She traces the outline
               of it with her thin finger.

               She turns back to him.

 FEMALE                          Thank you, Anderson.

               It is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a Precog.

 ANDERSON                          What am I going to do with you?

               Her eyes grow very serious.

 FEMALE                          Name me, Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          What?

 FEMALE                          Give me a name.  I've never had one.

               Anderson rises, moves around the small room.  He is shamed,
               embarrassed.

 ANDERSON                          Listen.

               She turns to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Listen to me.
                              (beat)
                         Listen to me ... Rose.

               It is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when
               she faces him again.

 FEMALE                          Rose.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  They shifted your precognition
                         so you would locate me.

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         Yes.  And it hurt us, physically.
                         Did you know that?  The helmets, the
                         controls.  It hurts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 86. 

 ANDERSON                               (guiltily)
                         I didn't know.

               For a long moment he can't say anything.  But there are things
               he needs to understand ...

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When they shifted you to find me,
                         you didn't reveal everything.  That
                         I was going to break into Precrime.

 ROSE                          We saw our chance.  You would need
                         to shut us down, you would have to
                         come.  We wanted you to come.

 ANDERSON                          You used me -- to save you.

 ROSE                          I have been used all my life,
                         Anderson.

               Anderson can't meet her eyes.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          No one cared that we were human.
                         From a human mother.  Taken at birth.
                         Hooked to machines.
                              (beat)
                         We have been alive, Anderson.
                         Enslaved, for the greater good.

               Her words are unbearable, for both of them.  She traces the
               outline of the wallpaper rose again.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          But now I have a name.  And I know
                         the man who has named - me will not
                         allow me to be enslaved again.

               Anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully
               watches the street below.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What's going to happen to us?
                         Can you see that?

 ROSE                          I'm weak.  And away from my brothers.
                         I see glimpses and hints of things
                         nearby.  But it's all ... scattered.
                              (beat)
                         I'm tired of the future, Anderson.

               She lies on the bed, watching as Anderson comes back to her.
               He sits carefully on the side of her bed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87. 

               Then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek

 ANDERSON                          You didn't know I was going to do
                         that, did you?

               She is almost too overwhelmed to speak

 ROSE                          No.  Oh, Anderson.  It was lovely.

               And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE DAWN 
               If he were not already dead, it would've killed Ennis Page
               to see the state of his living room.  Precrime officers
               everywhere.  Blood on the rug.  A gun beside the sofa.

               Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner
               crab walk Page's body.  It WHIRS and CLICKS as it probes and
               takes samples from various sites.

               The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab
               makes its determinations.

               Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Who else could it've been?

               The crab probes the ragged hole in Page's head

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
                         an undetected murder.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         Page worshipped the system.  He fell
                         apart.  Shot himself.

               The Lieutenant rolls his eyes.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Anderson.

               Witwer doesn't say anything.  He just stares at the body The
               crab finishes.  The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and
               turns his head to Witwer.  He is only a computer interface,
               but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his
               digitalized voice.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Director Witwer.  This event is a
                         positive homicide.

                         Two Investigation is in order.

               No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes
               and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself
               back in its box.

               At last, someone moves.  It is Witwer.  He lifts his arm,
               pulls back his shirtsleeve, and stares long and hard at his
               watch.

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- DAY LATER 
               Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play
               the two versions of Anderson's murder of Witwer.  Lisa points.

 LISA                          There.

               She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on
               the two monitors.

 CLOSE ON - THE MONITORS 
               On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes, on the right he
               has brown.

 LISA                          The one on the left, the first disc
                         -it's a fake.  He doesn't have blue
                         eyes anymore.

               Witwer stares for a long time.

 WITWER                          A fake.

 (BEAT)                          But the Precogs predict the infallible
                         truth.  They don't emit fake discs.

               And now Lisa smiles.  She has set her lawyerly mind to the
               solution.  It is her moment

 . 
 LISA                          Exactly.  You can't tamper with the
                         Precogs, induce them to make fakes

                         But that doesn't mean someone couldn't
                         have made a fake disc on their own
                         and inserted it into the delivery
                         system.

               The simplicity of it is inconceivable.  Witwer speaks
               carefully, trying to process it

 WITWER                          Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
                         disc in with that day's real ones...

 LISA                               (excited)
                         We're all programmed to believe
                         anything we see on a Precog disc.
                         The system has never been wrong ...

               Witwer stares at the proof before him.  -- the different
               colored eyes of Anderson.  He ejects both discs and holds
               them in his hands.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You have to call off the hunt.  He
                         was set up.

               Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding

 WITWER                               (long beat)
                         It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes
                         her head, shocked at his response

 LISA                          He was set up!  You both were.  If
                         Paul kills you, you're both out of
                         the picture.

 WITWER                          Who wants us out?  Of what picture?

 LISA                          Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing!  And
                         then we can investigate Witwer's
                         mouth opens and closes.  He tries
                         again.

 WITWER                          Ennis Page was murdered last night.

               The blood drains from Lisa's face

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Everything points to Paul.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. 

 LISA                          He's not a murderer.

 WITWER                          I think he is.  A murderer ... and a
                         future murderer.
                              (beat)
                         Lisa.  What does it matter that the
                         first disc is a fake ... if the second
                         one's real?

               Witwer's hands close tight on the discs.  Lisa stands there,
               motionless.  Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly.
               He watches her go.

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Rose sits in a chair near the window.  She is chewing lightly
               on a cracker.  Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's
               texture and taste.  She holds it up and admires its shape.

               Anderson's mood is less wondrous

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to
                         leave you here.  I have to keep
                         moving.

 ROSE'S SMILE ABRUPTLY VANISHES 
 ROSE                          No.  You must save my brothers.

 ANDERSON                          It's impossible.  There's no time.
                         I've done what I can do!

               Rose waits for him to finish.  She looks out the window at
               the street scene.

 ROSE                          Come here, Anderson.

	       He does, reluctantly.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Do you see that boy in the blue hat
                         walking with his mother?
                              (beat)
                         In sixty seconds he will walk beneath
                         those workers installing a window on
                         the tenth floor of that building.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS 
               Two men struggle to lift a large window in place.  Way below
               the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk
               holding his mother's hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. 

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          They'll drop the window, killing
                         him.  It is impossible to save him.

               Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door,
               hurls it open, and disappears down the hall.

               Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs

 EXT. THE STREET. 
               Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the WORKERS
               have lost their grip on the window.

               The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly
               toward disaster.  They do not appear to hear the MEN'S cries.

               The WINDOW falls end over end above the boy's head.  The
               sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it
               looks like a star falling from the sky.

               A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening, and cries
               out.

               But what Anderson does is run.  He runs faster and harder
               than humanly possible.  He does not care if he is recognized
               or hit by a passing taxi.  He is going to get to that boy.
               He has to get to that boy ...

               ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the
               window frame kisses the boy's blue hat.  He knocks the boy
               to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk.

               The mother does not even have time to scream.  She is on the
               ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy.

               He rolls away, and gets to his feet.  Before anyone can put
               together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley,
               and is gone.

 INT. THE ROOM - LATER 
               Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small
               cuts on his face and hands.  He stands across the room staring
               at Rose.

               Rose considers him.  When she speaks her voice is near and
               distant at the same time.  For Anderson, it is as if the
               words are coming from a place inside his own head.

 ROSE                          It was impossible to save that boy
                         -- but you did, Anderson.  It's in
                         you.  It's what you are.

               Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a
               wall.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92. 

 ANDERSON                          You knew it wasn't impossible.  That
                         I'd get there.

               Rose reveals nothing.

 ROSE                          You are a man who saves others.
                              (beat)
                         Save my brothers.

               Anderson almost laughs.  Her persistence is unbelievable

 ANDERSON                          I'm in a lot of trouble right now.

 ROSE                          My brothers are in more trouble.
                         They've moved them to ... an awful
                         place.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most
                         trouble of all.  Who saves him?

               Rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her
               head.  She curls into a fetal position.

               Anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder.  Her eyes
               roll into the back of her head.

               Whose pain is she feeling?  Her own?  Someone else's?
               Anderson doesn't want to think about it.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB -CHEVY CHASE, MD -- NIGHT 
               Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the two
               Precog brothers have been brought here.

               The room is makeshift, uncomfortable ... a place for
               experiments.  The brothers are strapped into chairs.  They
               are helmeted.

               But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in
               their jugular veins.  Connected to the needles are long twists
               of IV tubing.  There are several IVs running at high drip
               rates.

               Witwer has his back to all this.  He stands with Dr. Resfield,
               watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge
               mainframe.

               Dr. Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back at
               the Precogs, uneasy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're not really set up for this
                         type of 

               He stops talking when he looks into Witwer's hollow eyes. Witwer 
               is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- MORNING 
               Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water.  Her skin is
               translucent, unhealthy, glistening with sweat.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Try to drink.

               She pushes the cup away.  She closes her eyes, as if even
               the dim light of the room causes her pain.

 ROSE                          Your wife.  We have to get her here,
                         Anderson.

               She opens her eyes.  Anderson doesn't like the feel of this.

 ANDERSON                          Why?

 ROSE                          I don't know ...

 ANDERSON                          What are you seeing?

 ROSE                          Glimpses, Anderson.  Please.  We
                         have to get her here.

 ANDERSON                          You're scaring me, Rose

               She covers his mouth with her hand

 ROSE                          Stop talking.  It uses me up.

               For a long time, Rose says nothing, Her gaze is locked onto
               a distance beyond the room.  At last, she speaks.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          In three minutes your wife will take
                         a walk ..

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               Lisa sits in her office.  But she can't stand it, the sitting
               and waiting.  She has to move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 94. 

               She gets up and hurriedly leaves her office

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Witwer walks past Lisa's SECRETARY toward the open door of
               Lisa's office.

 SECRETARY                          Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for

                         Sir?

               Witwer stares into the empty office.  There is a clock on
               Lisa's desk.  His eyes fix on it.

 EXT. JUDICIAL CENTER ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble
               building.  She takes a deep breath, then heads down Jefferson
               Boulevard toward the city.

               A sleek black TRANSPORT with two Precrime officers in it
               follows her from a discreet distance.

               In the sky above, the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft

 INT. CITY STREET ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa walks down the street.  She hugs herself, barely aware
               of her surroundings.  She passes by stores, restaurants,
               payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious.  People push past
               her.

               On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone
               beside her begins to RING.  If she hears it, she gives no
               indication.  A KID reaches for it, listens, hangs up.

               She walks on.  Stores.  Restaurants.  An art gallery.  As
               she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE, it suddenly starts to
               ring.  This time Lisa glances at it.  But again, walks on.

               The TRANSPORT weaves through traffic, nearby She walks past
               the K.L. Lawrence Graphics Museum.  And another restaurant.
               And a PAYPHONE.  And this time, finally, when it, too, RINGS,
               she turns and looks hard at it.

               A man begins to walk over to it.  Lisa almost knocks him out
               of the way to get to it.  She grabs at the receiver.

 LISA                          Hello?  Hello?

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I need you.

               Lisa's forehead sags against the side of the payphone.  She
               basks in the sound of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95. 

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          It's 1:03.  Set your watch, exactly.

               Lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens
               LISA Okay.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          This is what you have to do ...

               We now hear ANDERSON continue in VOICE OVER as we follow
               Lisa through a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ...

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa walks up the steps of the museum

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter
                         the Lawrence Museum.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               Lisa walks quickly through a display of 19th century magazine
               advertising.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               The two Precrime officers walk into a room filled with Chinese
               graphics.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:13 the two Precrime officers
                         following you take a wrong turn into
                         a different room, losing sight of
                         you for ten seconds.

               The officers start toward the entrance way to another room,
               then hesitate uncertainly, and go for another entrance way.

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa hurries down the steps

 INT. A SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa boards the "A" MagLev train

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          An undercover transport officer will
                         have received emergency orders to
                         follow you.
 (MORE)                          He's wearing a red tie.  He has short
                         blond hair.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96. 

 INT. THE SUBWAY CAR 
               The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far
               end of Lisa's car, watching her.

               At the next stop Lisa gets off.  He follows, not too far
               behind.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa starts up the stairs.  She looks at her watch, then
               makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's
               time frame.  She starts up again.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          As you come around the bend, cry out
                         and turn around and slap the
                         officer...

               Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised. At the
               same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into
               view, and see this happening.  Lisa starts to run.  When the
               undercover officer tries to stop her, the two men grab the
               officer, and they get into a fight.

               Lisa escapes.

 INT. A TAXI - THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa looks at her watch, then taps the window for the driver
               to stop.  She gets out.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          Stay on Ninth street.  Underneath
                         Ninth street is the main power feed
                         for The Sprawl.  It'll mess up the
                         navigational beacon on the hovercraft.
                              (beat)
                         Keep switching taxis.  But stay on
                         Ninth.

               She hails another taxi.  She holds her hand over the
               IdentiScan before it can read her.  The taxi driver looks at
               her, sees her smile, sees the prepaid cash card she holds
               out to him.

 LISA                          Two hundred dollars if you don't
                         scan me.

               It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened.  He grabs
               the card, and jerks his head for her to get in.  They take
               off.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97. 

 EXT. NINTH STREET LATER 
               Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky.
               It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets,
               dirigibles.  Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft.

               And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          The hovercraft will try to drop
                         altitude, but the air traffic will
                         slow it down.
                              (beat)
                         Precrime loses you.  You'll have to
                         walk two miles.  Don't get scanned.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street.  She stands out in
               her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of
               black.

               Too vulnerable to pass up.  A MAN in a gray overcoat slides
               out from between two buildings in front of her.  He is not
               coy about his intent.  He comes straight at her, all business.

               Lisa freezes in place.  She looks at her watch.  The man
               grabs her by the shoulder.  When she starts to scream, he
               claps his hand over her mouth, hard.

 MAN                          You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your
                         teeth out.

               Her eyes look around frantically.  He starts to drag her
               backwards into the dark.

               ANDERSON leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a
               light post.  It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens
               his grip on Lisa.  His legs at last collapse under him.

               Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground.  She hugs him hard.

               Then pulls back from him.  She gives him a look.

 LISA                          Cut it a little close there,
                         honeybunch.

 ANDERSON                          Rose got the street wrong.  She's
                         getting weak.

 LISA                          Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER 
               Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson
               together.

               Lisa needs to touch him.  She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes
               back a loose look of his hair.  Rose is mesmerized by her
               actions.  She drinks in everything, every bit of life.

               Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation.  They speak to
               each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room.

               Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.

 ANDERSON                          Two discs.  One fake.  One real.

 LISA                          I don't think there were supposed to
                         be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't
                         counting on two.

               They are silent for a long time.  Rose watches them work it
               through.

 ANDERSON                          An infallible system.  Every disc
                         ever generated has been true ...

 LISA                          Somebody wants you out of the way --
                         so they make a fake disc.  Who ever
                         doubts the discs?

 ANDERSON                          I never doubted it.  I saw it.  And
                         believed it, absolutely.  I was
                         certain I was going to murder Witwer.

               Anderson is shaking.  Lisa wraps her arms around him.  His
               voice is a stunned whisper.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the fake, and believed so much
                         in the system, that I saw myself as
                         a murderer.
                              (beats)
                         And the Precogs picked up those
                         thoughts ...

 LISA                          And generated the second disc.  The
                         real one.

 ANDERSON                          A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I
                         believed it was true.  And that made
                         it true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. 

               Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose.  She lies curled on
               the bed, her face to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Rose.  If all this is based on a lie
                         -the fake disc -- then do I really
                         kill Witwer?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We see what we see.  I'm sorry,
                         Anderson.  It's been predicted.

               Such a small voice, delivering a message of such finality

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- MIDNIGHT 
               Lieutenant Glaser tries to get through to Witwer.  Witwer's
               back is turned to him.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We can't take chances, sir

               Witwer doesn't move or answer.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          It happens in less than three hours.
                              (beat)
                         We put you in a hovercraft and keep
                         you airborne -- until after the event.

 WITWER                          The event.

               Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I've been ordered to get you onto
                         the craft.  By force if necessary.

 WITWER                          The event is inevitable, Lieutenant.

	        Witwer doesn't turn around.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The Precogs are never wrong.  The
                         event will take place.  I'm a
                         believer.  Aren't you?

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I don't leave this room without you,
                         sir.  The Security Panel insists.

 CUT TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 100. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE SIMULTANEOUS 
               Anderson and Lisa keep working it, peeling away the layers.
               Rose lies silent.

 ANDERSON                          Nobody could slip a fake disc past
                         Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.

 LISA                          He was the weak link in the perfect
                         system.

 ANDERSON                          Obsessive compulsive niners can't
                         allow changes in the routine

 LISA                          Something threw him off.
                              (beat)
                         He tried to tell me.  It didn't make
                         any sense.  Something about "spilled
                         coffee."
                              (beat)
                         Someone was in his office with him.
                         And coffee spilled ...

               We stay CLOSE ON Anderson and Lisa as Rose's voice cuts in.

 ROSE (V.O.)                          We were always treated as if we
                         weren't alive.  As if we weren't
                         there.

               The camera pulls back and they are watching her as she
               continues to speak.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Even now.  You forget that I'm here.
                         You talk between yourselves.  And
                         when you need me to see into the
                         future, then you turn to me.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What is it?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We weren't just lost in the future.
                         We were in the Chamber, too.  Our
                         eyes were open.  In the present.

               And then Anderson gets it.  He kneels beside her bed

 ANDERSON                          Your eyes were open.  What did you
                         see, Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101. 

 ROSE                          Who would I have told?  Who ever
                         talked to us?  Who cared that we
                         could talk?

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Who spilled the coffee?
                         Straight ahead ...

               Rose stares stright ahead ...

 MEMORY HIT 
               Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber.  Her brothers
               sit in their usual places on either side of her.  The
               technicians tend to them.

               Rose's eyes are open.  She sees everything in the room.  The
               technicians, the machines ... and across the room a large
               window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe
               computer.

               Rose watches through the window ...

               As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them

 ROSE (V.O.)                          Ed Witwer entered Page's office.

               Witwer carries a mug of coffee.

               Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee.  Speaks
               to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee.  We can't hear
               the words.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Page was so upset at the sight of
                         the coffee.

               Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table.  It
               tips, and spills.

               Page looks like his head will explode.  He pulls a neatly
               folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops
               to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the
               coffee stain on his spotless rug.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket,
                         reached over Page and put it in one
                         of the open cases.

               Witwer closes the case.  He looks through the window into
               the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose --
               and what does she matter?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102. 

               Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug.  Witwer shrugs in
               apology and leaves the room.  Page stares after him.

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Rose is weeping.  She looks at Anderson and Lisa.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          I didn't understand what I'd seen.
                         And I had no one to tell ...

               Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend
               what he has heard.

 ANDERSON                          Ed ...

               Lisa turns, and speaks softly to her husband.

 LISA                          The perfect system -brought down by
                         a cup of coffee.  My god.

 ANDERSON                               (long beat)
                         He set into motion his own death.
                         He didn't know it would go this far.
                              (to Rose)
                         What makes me leave this room?  If I
                         stay here I won't kill him.  Right?

               But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question
               for him.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE 
               Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch.  Witwer is still in
               his chair, turned away from him.

 WITWER                          You see, if you think you can put me
                         on a hovercraft and save me, then
                         you don't believe in the infallibility
                         of the Precog system.

               Lieutenant Glaser has his orders.  He begins to approach.

               And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts
               the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant
               Glaser in the forehead.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And what I do not want around me,
                         are nonbelievers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103. 

               Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks
               out of the office, locking the door behind him.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD -- LATER 
               Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete
               building that houses the lab.  The lights are out in all the
               windows except the back section of the second floor.  There,
               the lights burn brightly.

               Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it.
               He smiles as if he knows something they don't.  He looks at
               his watch.  It is a cool night, but his face is slick with
               sweat.

               He walks to the entrance of the building.  An OFFICER 1s
               startled to see him.

 WITWER                          Things quiet?

 OFFICER                          Sir.  Should you ... be here?

 WITWER                          There's been a development.  A body's
                         been found in the Sprawl.

 OFFICER                          Anderson's?

 WITWER                          They're checking it out.  I need to
                         see what the Precogs have seen.

               Witwer is IdentiScanned.  The door opens and he goes in.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Dr. Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying
               a tv under his arm.  Witwer is the last person he wants to
               see.

 WITWER                          Borrowed this from the technicians'
                         lounge.  You don't think they'll
                         mind, do you?

 DR.RESFIELD                          You shouldn't be here, Director.

               Dr. Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall,
               the red numbers ticking off time in seconds.

               Witwer looks for a plug, finds one.  Plugs in the tv.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 104. 

 WITWER                          No, no.  This is exactly where I
                         should be.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You're under a lot of strain,
                         Director.

               Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of
               his murder by Anderson.  "Call Now!  Call Now!"

 WITWER                          And tv's so good for that -- soothes
                         the mind.

               Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a
               bright smile.  The scientist looks like he wants to run out
               of the room.

               Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the
               Precogs.  Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting
               IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets.

               The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.
               But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too
               weak for that.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Bring me up to speed, Doc.

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're getting nothing from them.

 WITWER                          And that's because ... ?

               Witwer still grips him by the elbow.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I don't know.

 WITWER                          Do you think they know where Anderson
                         is?

 DR. RESFIELD                          It's impossible to tell.
                              (beat)
                         We've done everything.  Maybe even
                         too much.

 WITWER STARES AT THE PRECOGS 
 WITWER                          They know how to find Anderson for
                         me.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105. 

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         They're the perfect machine, Doctor.
                         You just have to know which button
                         to push.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL 
               Rose looks like she's on fire.  Anderson wets another towel,
               wrings it over the sink.  Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's
               face and arms .

               Rose's lips are moving soundlessly.  Her eyes are shut tight.
               She begins to writhe in bed.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus Christ.

 LISA                          Come on, Rose.

 ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH 
 ANDERSON                          One hour.  We hold it together for
                         an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not
                         a murderer.

 LISA                          She won't last an hour.

               It suddenly looks much worse than that.  Rose's body contorts
               horribly and she arches up off the bed.  Lisa can't control
               her.

               Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to
               hold and comfort her.

 ANDERSON                          Rose!

               She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.

 ROSE                          He's killed him, Anderson!

               Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes
               slack.  Anderson eases her back on the bed.  He stares at
               her, stricken.

               Her voice barely leaves her now

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          You didn't save my brother.

               Anderson reels at her words.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106. 

 ANDERSON                          Did he kill both of them, Rose?
                         Rose!

               Rose manages to speak, one last time.  Her whispered words
               damn him.

 ROSE                          Does it matter, Anderson?

               Anderson rises.  Looks down at Rose.

               It matters.  He starts to move, quickly.

               Lisa takes hold of his arm.

 LISA                          If you leave this room...

	       Anderson kisses her.

 ANDERSON                          Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
                         hisjob.

               He reaches for his duffel bag.

               When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly
               and looks.  And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a
               place deep within her own mind.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER 
               He passes by several cars on the street.  But they're all
               auto-drive, they won't do him any good.

               So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a
               city police transport zooms up, lights flashing.  Two city
               officers leap out of the transport.  They approach the
               smashed-in store window, weapons drawn.  Which is a mistake.
               Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a
               small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on.

               As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with
               BindFoam.

               Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power
               the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof.
               Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets
               of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.

 INT. THE LAB 
               The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time.  Witwer reaches his
               hand up and touches the vanishing numbers.

               The camera pulls back, and we see Dr. Resfield and the two
               technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 107. 

               And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on
               the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers.
               A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of
               his skull.

               The other Precog sits very still in his chair.  He is still
               connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs
               drip into him.  His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves,
               the Precog's eyes follow him.

               Witwer can feel them on him.  He turns around.

 WITWER                          Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?
                              (beat)
                         I think yes.

               The Precog looks at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And you think yes.

               Witwer points to the tv screen, running Anderson's murder of
               Witwer.  Witwer smiles triumphantly.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Infallibly, immutably yes.

               The Precog looks at him.  Witwer's smile vanishes, and
               suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over
               the Precog's eyes.  Then he turns, and stares again at the
               clock.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB 
               Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the
               building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons
               cradled in their arms.

               Behind them is a line of yew bushes.  AS we watch, the officer
               on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes.
               Several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the
               officer on the right.

               The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right.
               Then he looks hard.  He grips his weapon tight, and swings
               left.  No one there, either.

               ANDERSON drops him hard, from behind.  The officer crumples
               onto the cement.

               But Anderson's not done with him.  Anderson lifts him up,
               struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance.

               Anderson holds him upright in place.  The man's head lolls
               backward.  Which is.  Perfect for what Anderson needs to do.
               Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes.
               He pulls up on the eyelids.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 108. 

               An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's
               eyes.  Access granted, the doors HISS open.  Anderson enters
               the building, dragging the officer with him.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Anderson enters the lab.  The very building sickens him.
               What he sees sickens him even more.

               The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair.  Witwer
               sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother
               at his feet.  Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet.  His
               hand is in his lap, holding a gun.

               He grins when Anderson appears.  He takes off the helmet,
               drops it on the floor.

 WITWER                          I figured, since I can see the future,
                         too, maybe I could get a little disc
                         action going.
                              (beat)
                         Just kidding.

               Anderson stares at his old partner.  Then he looks up at the
               digital clock.  Five-seventeen AM.  Witwer looks too, then
               turns back to Anderson.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You find you been doing that a lot
                         this week?  Looking at clocks?
                              (beat)
                         Three minutes to go.

               Anderson turns to the tv.

 ANDERSON                          There's never anything good on, you
                         know?

               Now Witwer smiles.

 WITWER                          There.  That's the old Paul.

 ANDERSON                          You're not the old Ed. You've lost
                         it.

               Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.

 WITWER                          You lost it.  You went weak in the
                         knees, partner.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not your partner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 109. 

               Witwer looks at him sadly.

 WITWER                          The air went out of you when Frank
                         D'Ignazio killed himself.

 ANDERSON                          He was guilty.  I accepted that.

 WITWER                          No you didn't.  The doubts were
                         creeping in on you.  The lab trying
                         to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm
                         pressuring you to expand ...

               Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog
               brother's cheek.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Belief is the basis of the system.
                         It was your job to be the ultimate
                         believer.

               Witwer is breathing hard.  He lifts a hand and wipes the
               sweat from his face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And when Frank died, you faltered.
                         I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of
                         men.
                              (beat)
                         And the thing about you is, you
                         wouldn't have just walked away.

 ANDERSON                          Never been my style.

	      Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile

 WITWER                          Precrime needs to grow.  You would
                         have stood in its way.  The Security
                         Panel wouldn't have understood that.
                         What you're capable of.  What a
                         bulldog you are.
                              (beat)
                         Look what you've been doing to us
                         all week.  Amazing.  You're the best.

 ANDERSON                          So you took matters into your own hands.

 WITWER                          I understood the threat.  I understood
 YOU 
               Anderson looks at the dead Precog

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110. 

 ANDERSON                          You killed a Precog.  You ended the
                         system you wanted to protect.

 WITWER                          Wrong.  This lab will make more.
                         Believe it, Paul.

               They look at the CLOCK.  Five-nineteen.

 ANDERSON                          Knowing the exact moment of your
                         death -it's made you crazy, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the tv.  The TV REALITY is almost in synch
               with what is happening in the room.

               Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is
               terribly wrong.

               Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the
               disc -- except there is a major difference.

 WITWER                          You sonofabitch!

               Anderson lifts up both hands

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You didn't bring your gun!

 ANDERSON                          That's right.  No gun.

 WITWER                          You see?!  That's exactly what I'm
                         talking about.  You don't Believe!

               Anderson just looks at Witwer, raging at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The system is infallible.

               ANDERSON Doesn't Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and
               pulls a second gun from out of his belt.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          I guess that's why I've always carried
                         two.

               He tosses the gun to Anderson.  It clatters at Anderson's
               feet.

 ANDERSON                          You can't have it both ways.  You
                         don't want to die.  That's why you
                         lured me here -- to kill me first.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         But it you don't diet the system is
                         flawed, and you couldn't live with
                         that.

               Witwer SHOOTS him once, in the right thigh.  Anderson cries
               out, falls to the concrete floor.

 WITWER                          Pick it up

               Anderson speaks through his teeth ANDERSON It doesn't happen.

               Witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock.

               He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back IV
               feeding into the Precog's main line.  A thick, yellow fluid
               begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You're killing him, partner.

               And what choice, finally, does Anderson have?  He reaches
               for the gun.

 ANDERSON                          Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains
                         his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains
                         his gun on Witwer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Oh, Ed ...

               Witwer lowers his gun.  And stands there between Anderson
               and the doomed Precog.

               The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.

               Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart.  Witwer is thrown
               back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.

               Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV
               out of the main line.  The yellow drips onto the floor,
               mingling with Witwer's red.

               Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him.  Witwer
               whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.

 WITWER                          Now do you believe?

               Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last
               breaths alone.

 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               It is Rose's face.  The camera pulls back and we see that
               she is lying on a grassy hillside.  Her brother is lying
               beside her.

               They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with
               stars.

               Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to
               her brother.

 ROSE                          James.  Can you guess what I'm
                         thinking?

 NO.

 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her
               features as fragile as porcelain.  Her eyes are closed in
               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.

               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are
               male, and they float into position on either side of the
               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,
               and like the female their eyes are closed.

               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,
               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,
               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.

               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp
               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes
               open.

               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.

               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a
               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...

 FEMALE                               (frightened woman)
 JOHNNY, PLEASE MALE RIGHT                               (mocking man)
                         "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 FEMALE                          You're scaring me.

 MALE LEFT                               (child's voice)
 DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
 MALE RIGHT                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 FEMALE                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me.  Please.

 MALE RIGHT                          Oh, Carol.

 FEMALE                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 

 MALE RIGHT                          Don't grab at me!  Let

 MALE LEFT                          Daddy!  No!

               All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but
               we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a
               man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,
               the whimpering cries of their son.

               And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three
               faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.
               Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.

               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt
               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare
               straight at us, accusing.

               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and
               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 EXT. SUBURBIA DAY 
               Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the
               midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
               the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.
               Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.

               In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,
               long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.

               Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on
               trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,
               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go
               back into their houses.

               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,
               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It
               is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are
               safe.

 INT. A HOUSE 
               A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone
               fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,
               a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of
               children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. 

               A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a
               picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly
               at the scene outside.

 CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL 
               A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball
               gets away from her, and rolls into the street.

               At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds
               the corner.

               The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.

 THE FAMILY ROOM 
               Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry
               out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She
               watches.  And smiles a little.

 OUTSIDE 
               The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white
               shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
               the car.

               Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.
               Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in
               front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.

               Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road
               in front of him, going for her ball.

               CAROL Watches, her smile in place.

 OUTSIDE 
	       The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears 
	       down on her.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a
               halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
               what is happening.

 THE STREET 
               The car has stopped, inches from the girl.

               The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.
               She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. 

               The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on
               its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and
               disappears.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she
               sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his
               pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?

 JOHNNY                               (gruff)
                         Why'd you let me sleep so long?

 CAROL                          It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --
                              (beat)
                         Why are you staring at me like that?

               He takes a step toward her.  He stands there, his thick black
               hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,
               considering her.

 JOHNNY                          I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
                         long.

               He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.
               A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks
               at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,
               without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his
               way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which
               sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has
               caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
               which lie across a fold of colored cloth.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down
               his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.
               Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.

               A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills
               with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,
               alarmed.

               In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban
               trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.

               The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone
               freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
               drama.

               Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK
               TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they
               seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
               Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
               process them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. 

               Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
               More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their
               uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their
               left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some
               sort of complicated glove.

 CLOSE 
 ON - A GLOVE 
               The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger
               ending in an open barrel.

               Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not
               America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world
               of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is
               intermeshed with hypertechnology.

               And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he
               makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering
               behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out
               of the way.

               Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a
               backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
               handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.

               He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an
               IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.

               The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver
               a dozen times.

               In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three
               dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning
               like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming
               police deterrent presence has been established.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,
               too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and
               which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the
               futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.

 INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET 
               Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his
               wife's dresses.

 UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
               Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands
               out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points
               his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove
               BEEPS softly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. 

               The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears
               on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
               man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
               officer.

 THE BEDROOM 
               The room is packed with police -- how many are real?

 THE CLOSET 
               Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls
               out through the door.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do anything!

 OUTSIDE THE CLOSET 
               Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
               his index barrel at the closet door.  The effect is deeply
               accusatory.

               An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to
               be as menacing as possible.

 OFFICER 1                          Come out of the closet on your hands
                         and knees.

               Nothing happens.  Two officers aim their barrels at the
               perimeter of the door.  In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the
               closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among
               the dresses.

               Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is
               blasted away beneath his feet.

 OFFICER 1                          Hands and knees!

               Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops.
               He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.  He lifts
               his head and looks up at the officer.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't... 

		Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
		"IdentiScan" on its side -- and blips a red laser light 
		into each of Johnny's, eyes, reading his irises.  The 
                officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.

 OFFICER 2 POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. 

 OFFICER 1                               (to Johnny)
                         John Palmer, if you were being
                         arrested for any other crime, I would
                         now read you your rights.
                              (beat)
                         But you are under arrest for the
                         future murderer of your wife, Carol
                         Palmer.  You have no rights.

               Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- LATER 
               In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police
               vehicle as the neighbors look on.  Carol and her son stand
               in the doorway, stunned.

               TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets.  The first man is tall,
               sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is PAUL ANDERSON,
               late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington
 D.C. 
               The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,
               late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the
               shoulders, short brown hair.

               The two men are deeply comfortable together.  They can speak,
               or not.  It doesn't matter -- they still communicate.  Two
               good cops, good together.

               They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the
               holographic decoy cops.

 WITWER                          Thought we might a had a runner.

               Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah, a runner.

 WITWER                          A little chase -- that'd been good.

 ANDERSON                          Fifty cops on the scene takes the
                         chase out of them.

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         But only eight of us were real.

               Witwer dematerializes the last decoy.

 ANDERSON                          We ever get a runner, I'd be too old
                         to give chase.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. 

 WITWER                          You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man.

               They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime
               vehicle holding Johnny zoom SOUNDLESSLY away.

 ANDERSON                          I love it more Johnny boy doesn't
                         get to murder his wife.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         It's a beautiful world.

 EXT. SAME SCENE -- LATER 
               The children play on their trikes.  The wives talk among
               themselves.  The birds sing, the dogs bark.

               The little girl bounces her red ball again.  She stops a.
               minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her,
               unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape.

 INT. A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON) DAY 
               Decorated in a 1950's style.  Anderson lies in bed beside
               his wife, LISA, a pretty, green-eyed brunette.  It is early
               morning, they are both awake.  Her hand caresses his chest.
               Maybe they will make love.

               Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.

 LISA                          Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering.
                              (playfully)
                         I excite you that much?

               He turns to her, and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile
               vanish.

 ANDERSON                          I used to love being a cop.  

 LISA                          You're still a cop.  I'm a factory
                         worker.  We don't catch murderers.
                         We process them.

               Lisa takes a long breath.  She's been down this road before.
               She speaks reassuringly.

 LISA                          You're the best homicide cop in the
                         country.

	       ANDERSON snorts disdainfully.

 ANDERSON                          Great -- except there's no such thing
                         as homicide.  What I do best doesn't
                         exist anymore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. 

 LISA PAUL.                               (beat)
                         You're the Director of a perfect
                         system.  A Cop with a perfect record

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs have a perfect record.
                         They identify the accused -- I just
                         put on my monkey suit and go round
                         them up.

               Lisa hugs him, kisses the back of his neck.

 LISA                          And then I prosecute them.  And they
                         go to jail.  And lives are saved.
                         Thousands of lives.
                              (beat)
                         And that's a cop's dream.

               Anderson is silent for a time.  He sighs, then smiles, and
               turns to his wife, takes her in his arms.

 ANDERSON                          No.  You're a cop's dream.

 INT. THE BATHROOM -- LATER 
               Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself
               dry- He glances out a casement window.  He tilts his head,
               curious, then wipes at the steam on the window.

 ANDERSON'S POV LISA 
               Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a
               cell phone.  She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.

 ANDERSON 
               Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.

 INT. KITCHEN -- LATER 
               Checkered linoleum floor.  Appliances out of the 1950's.

               Except there are little differences.  When Lisa puts a skillet
               of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric
               coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light.

               Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket.
               Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt,
               wingtipped shoes.  He doesn't look up from the newspaper as
               he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          Who called?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. 

               Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs.  She touches
               her long brown hair.

 LISA                          No one.  I called about my hair.
                         Getting it done this afternoon.

               Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when
               suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door.  Anderson and
               Lisa both turn and smile.

 ANDERSON                          Come on in, neighbor.  Want some
                         coffee?

 OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
               FRANK D'IGNAZIO, 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before
               coming in.  A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches
               quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his
               EYES, scanning the irises.  The arm lifts out of view, the
               screen door UNLATCHES.

               Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Brought these for your supper.

 LISA                          Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank
                         you.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Sweet, nothing.  I gotta get rid of
                         these things.  One plant, and I'm
                         invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a
                         kid ...

               Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back,
               teases him.

 ANDERSON                          Before all this genetically engineered
                         crap ...

               Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be
                         a challenge to grow things.  An art.
                         Now you put one plant in the ground
                         -- then jump the hell out of the
                         way.

               Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down.

 ANDERSON                          Coffee?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. 

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys
                         are rushing off to work anyway.

               Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson.

 LISA                          You and Ellie come for supper then.

 ANDERSON                          We'll barbecue.

               Frank nods and pushes on the screen door.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          You betcha.  We'll bring some more
                         tomatoes -- a new batch will have
                         grown by then.

               They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper.

 EXT. DRIVEWAY -- LATER 
               Anderson waves to Lisa.  Her big Studebaker drives off down
               the tree-lined street and away.

               Anderson approaches his Chevy.  He doesn't take out a key to
               unlock it.  There is no lock.  He slides in behind the wheel.
               Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no
               ignition.

               A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans
               Anderson's EYES, identifying him.  A seat harness wraps around
               him, and the car STARTS.

               Anderson picks up a folder marked "Precrime" and begins to
               read through the papers.  The Chevy backs out of the driveway
               and takes him to work.

 EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA, VA -- LATER 
               A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the
               spillover from Washington D.C. across the Potomac River into
               Virginia.

               Beyond the white of Washington is "The Sprawl" -- the massive
               unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts
               of the Capitol.  It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially
               to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs.

               Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars.
               Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them.  In the
               sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,
               holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.
               On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to
               flash: "I LIKE MIKE!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. 

               Then a picture of the smiling President appears.  Then the
               words: "RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR
 YEARS! KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE!" 
 INSIDE ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic
               road sign.

               THE ROAD SIGN reads: "FBI Headquarters 1 mile.  CIA
               Headquarters 1.5 miles.  PRECRIME Headquarters 2 miles."

               Anderson goes back to his papers.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair.
               He abruptly rises and begins to pace.  The room is large,
               but he paces like a lion confined in a cage.

               He punches an intercom.  A female VOICE responds.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          Yes, Director Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he
                         delivered this morning's Precog discs?

               Ed Witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks
               in.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          I'll find him, sir.

               Ed shakes his head, smiles.

 WITWER                          Bullying the staff again, Director
                         Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Screw you.

               Anderson turns away and stares out a large window.  Witwer
               joins him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Was that fun for you, yesterday?

 WITWER                          The Johnny Palmer bust?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It was okay.  We got our man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. 

               Anderson takes a long breath.

 ANDERSON                          When do we not get our man?

               They turn as Ennis PAGE, 44, a thin, tight little man with
               burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room.  He carries a
               black BRIEFCASE marked:

               "Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria, VA." The case is cuffed
               to his wrist.

 PAGE                          Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put
                         out a heavy national volume this
                         morning -- four for our zone.

 ANDERSON (DISTRACTED)                          Put the case on my desk, Ennis.

               Page hesitates, doesn't do it.  Anderson moves quickly to
               Page.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          What was I thinking.

               Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE.  A small panel recedes, a
               red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, BEEPS
               affirmatively, then clicks off.  The cuff on Page's wrist
               falls open.

               Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk.  Page hesitates.
               Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do.  Page
               reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers
               strewn on Anderson's desk.

               Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles.  When Page looks
               up they try to cover, but are not quick enough.  He frowns
               tightly, and heads for the door.

               Anderson calls after him.

 ANDERSON                          Thanks, Ennis.  

               Witwer turns to leave, too.

 WITWER                          Now that's a guy who really cares.

               Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office.

               Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens
               the briefcase.  Four small bright DISCS sit in rows.  He
               removes one, places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into
               view from the center of his desk.  He sits back, weary, and
               watches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. 

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A young black woman stands in a hallway.  She stares at a
               door, gun in hand.  She opens the door, enters a bedroom.

               She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping.  She
               lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form.

               ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new
               disc.

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A white woman stands at a stove, cooking.  A man comes up
               behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands.
               He raises the necktie toward her neck

 ANDERSON 
               He's not watching the screen.  He is out of his chair now, 
               looking out the window.

 INT. PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY 
               A tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations
               tours run by present-day FBI.  The TOUR GUIDE, a pretty,
               smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of
               adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the
               building.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Precrime was established in 2030,
                         with the harnessing of the remarkable
                         talents of the Precognitive mutants.

               She points cheerfully to a stubby little man, MR. HARRIS.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
                         Precogs there are?

 MR. HARRIS                          Three.  Uh, right?

 TOUR GUIDE                          That's exactly right!  A lot of people
                         assume there are Precogs in every
                         branch office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. 

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          But there are only three Precogs,
                         right here in this building.  And
                         the information they give us, we
                         send out to all the other branches.
                              (beat)
                         And what is that information -what
                         do the Precogs do?

               An eager boy, TIMMY has the answer to that one.

 TIMMY                          They protect us.

               The guide tousles his hair.

 TOUR GUIDE                               (chipper voice)
                         That's right, Timmy.  Because of the
                         Precogs, you're going to grow up
                         murderfree.  Isn't that something?

 MR. HARRIS                          They ever wrong?  The Precogs ever
                         screw up when they predict a murder?

               The guide laughs tolerantly.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Never, sir.  It's an infallible
                         system.  The Precogs predict a
                         homicide, and our Precrime police
                         then apprehend that future murderer
                         before the event occurs.  And right
                         next door is the Judicial Center,
                         where we prosecute the
                         future murderers.

 TIMMY                          Can we see the Precogs?

 TOUR GUIDE                          No, I'm sorry.  That part of the
                         building is not open to the public.
                              (beat)
                         Now, if you'll just step this way
 ... 
               She waves the group on toward an elevator.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed
               for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs.  They
               are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. 

               Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees.  The bodies
               of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed,
               groomed.

               The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate HELMET
               that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright
               metallics.  The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces
               seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.

               A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of
               light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize
               into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe
               computer.

               The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.
               They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.
               Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes
               from murders only they can see.  Life for a Precog is an
               endless cycle of death.

 CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG 
               we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening
               scene of the movie.  She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.
               Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or
               eternally old.

               The technicians lift her from her bath.  She is dried, dressed
               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.
               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side
               of her.

               Not once are their helmets removed.  What they feed into the
               mainframe is too valuable.  It must be gathered twenty-four
               unrelenting hours a day.

 INT. A ROOM 
               Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber.  He
               can see them through a large window.  He works a large
               computer console, the gathering point for the information
               the Precogs constantly feed the computer.

               Perhaps every ten seconds, a small DISC is released by the
               computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under
               Page's watchful eye -- into a black case.

               ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page.  As
               Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from
               his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in
               the room as an intruder in his special domain.

               Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs.

 ANDERSON                          What would they think about if we
                         unhooked them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. 

               Page looks up from his work.

 PAGE                          They don't think, sir.  They just
                         see.

               Anderson is silent.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          They're not even alive, really.

               Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then
               turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 


               The female Precog sits in her chair.  Her eyes are open.
               She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room.
               In the window we see Anderson leaving the room.

               The female Precog's eyes drift closed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT.COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               A trial is in progress.  The defendant is Johnny Palmer.  He
               sits, ashen, at a table, his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him.

               There are no jurors in the Juror BOX.  There is a JUDGE, 55,
               and stern.  There are a few people in the public seats.

               The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson.  She
               wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,
               Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.

 LISA                          Director Anderson, do you swear that
                         the disc you now present to the court
                         is the only and authentic disc of
                         the future murder of Carol Palmer by
                         her husband, John Palmer?

               It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of
               times.  Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the
 DISC. 
 ANDERSON                          Yes.  This is the only and authentic
                         disc of the event seen by the
                         Precognitive mutants and recorded by
                         the Precrime Division.  This is the
                         immutable evidence of the infallible
                         system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. 

 LISA                          The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
 ... ? 
 ANDERSON                          In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at
                         10:33 in the morning.

               Lisa steps back.  The judge reaches out and Anderson hands
               him the disc.  The judge inserts it into a special video
               machine on his desk.  Anderson steps down, his ritual part
               in this trial completed.

               A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge.  He does not
               turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor.

               Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide.  We now see, in detail,
               what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning
               of the movie.

 THE MONITOR 
               The Palmer's family room.  Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing
               basket for the scissors.  Carol stands defenseless in front
               of him.  Their son cowers in a corner of the room.

 CAROL                          Johnny, please --

 JOHNNY                          "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 CAROL                          You're scaring me.

 JOHNNY'S SON DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
               Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace.

 JOHNNY                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 CAROL                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me. Please.  

               We cut away from the monitor and stay on JOHNNY PALMER'S FACE 
               as he sits at the defense table.  He winces at each terrible exchange.

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Oh, Carol.

 CAROL (O.S.)                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. 

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Don't grab at me!  Let go...

 JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.)                          Daddy!  No!

               Johnny Palmer cries out as the MONITOR goes blank.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It
                         didn't happen!

               The JUDGE hits his gavel.

 JUDGE                          How does the defense plead?

               The defense attorney glances at his watch, then quickly
               rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual.

 DEFENSE ATTORNEY                          The defense acknowledges the
                         infallibility of the system.  We are
                         Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the
                         mercy of the court.

 JOHNNY                          No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No!

               The court guards are on him in an instant.  They lead him
               out of the courtroom.

 INT.A BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and
               enters a disheveled room.  The fifties interior is drab: a
               Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in
               front of a TV.

               Ed Witwer is already on the scene.  He stands a few feet
               from the BODY of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun
               on the floor nearby.

 WITWER                               (to Anderson)
                         Looks like the old days.

               Anderson nods to his former partner.  Anderson leans over
               the body.

 ANDERSON                          That would be bad news for an
                         infallible system.

               Witwer is suddenly bored.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20. 

 WITWER                          We know it can't be a murder -- the
                         Precogs would've seen it.  Why do
                         you insist on coming to these things?

 ANDERSON                          Keeps the system honest.  And besides,
                         I like to pretend I'm a cop.

               Anderson turns to an officer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Who's got the Coroner?

               Another OFFICER steps forward with a large blue case.

 OFFICER                          Right here, sir.

               The officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the
               latches.  Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS: the
               "Coroner."

               It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises
               crab-like, and steps out of its case.

               Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move.  His projected
               image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his
               back.  He is the interface, the way the humans communicate
               with the crab apparatus.

 ANDERSON                          Hi DOC.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Hello, Director Anderson.

               The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down
               on the floor.  It moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the
               body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core
               samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.

 WITWER                          This a homicide, Doc?

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I'm presently analyzing neurohormones,
                         Assistant Director Witwer.  I have
                         not concluded my examination.

               The crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          I'm detecting carbonization of skull
                         fragments around the entry wound.

               Witwer whispers to Anderson.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. 

 WITWER                          Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his
                         own head.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I have not determined that yet,
                         Assistant Director.

               Witwer grins.

 WITWER                          You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.

               The coroner crab steps away from the body.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Please rotate the corpse to the
                         lateral supine position.

               Two officers turn the body face-up.  The crab inches close
               to probe the face.  Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids,
               and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment
               the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive.

               Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it
               comes to a standstill.  The holographic Doctor closes his
               eyes as if in thought.

 WITWER                          Can you imagine if this was a
                         homicide?  Who even knows how to
                         hunt down a killer any more?

               Anderson gives him a hard look.

 ANDERSON                          I know how, dammit.  You know how.

 WITWER                          Easy, partner.
                              (beat)
                         But you know what I'm saying.  The
                         state legislatures are pushing to
                         stop funding for training homicide
                         detectives ...

 ANDERSON                          God bless the Precogs.

               The Doctor opens his eyes.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          This event is a negative homicide.
                         A mortal wound was generated by a
                         .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
                         the parietal 'portion of the skull
                         on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm,
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. 

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          Eastern Standard Time.  This event
                         is a positive suicide.

               The holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears
               back into the coroner crab.  The crab crawls back into its
               case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and
               shuts down.

               Witwer turns to Anderson.

 WITWER                          It's time to stop coming to these,
                         partner.

               Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a
               stretcher.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  You're right.

 INT. A BANQUET - WASHINGTON, D.C. -- NIGHT 
               Anderson, in black-tie, with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown
               at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level
               government officials and politicians.

 ANDERSON                          A little bit of me dies every time I
                         come to one of these things.

 LISA                          It's only a party, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I'd never have let them appoint me
                         to Precrime if I'd have known this
                         was going to be part of it.

 LISA                          You're exactly what Precrime needed.
                         An amazing homicide cop and a real
                         person in an unreal job.

 ANDERSON                          Exactly.  

 LISA 			 The public loves the
                         Precogs.  But they give people the
                         creeps, too.  You're something they
                         understandp a regular cop running
                         things.

               Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed
               banquet hall.

 ANDERSON                          Let's invite all these irregular
                         assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers
                         and beer - think they'd come?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. 

               A barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair,
               SENATOR MALCOLM, 58, takes hold of Anderson's elbow from
               behind.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I'd come, Mr. Director.  And I'd
                         make all the other assholes come
                         with me.

               Lisa reddens, Anderson gives an embarrassed cough.  The
               Senator laughs and claps him on the back.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Nice job this morning.  Another
                         negative homicide.  The Precogs never
                         let us down.

               Mrs. Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa, while the Senator eases
               Anderson in the opposite direction 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                         I have a dream, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I know you do, Senator.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just
                         predicting murders, but predicting
                         all crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults
 ... 
 ANDERSON                          How about jaywalking?  Littering?
                         Now there's a crime.

               The Senator smiles through his teeth.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I don't want a police state, you
                         know that.  But we have an opportunity
                         here, and

 ANDERSON                          No sir, we don't have that
                         opportunity.  There are only three
                         Precogs.  They're a lucky accident
                         of nature.  There are no more.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (beat)
                         We can make more.  Just give me your
                         support.  Help me increase funding
                         for the Precog Engineering Project.

 ANDERSON                          Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing
                         into the future is a gift, a
                         nonreproducible event.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          There was only one Mozart, and there
                         are only three Precogs.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be
                         safe.  They want that more than they
                         want food or love.

               He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Look at us -it's 2040 and we've
                         wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's
                         like a big security blanket.  Why?
                         Because we want to feel like they
                         felt.  Safe.

 ANDERSON                          Senator, a world filled with hundreds
                         of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
                         place.

               The Senator gives it one last shot.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Sure could use your help, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (icily)
                         Don't think I'll come to your barbecue
                         after all.

               The senator moves off.  Anderson stands stiffly among the
               sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD DAY 
               Anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, DR,
               RESFIELD, 60, the head scientist.  It is not a place that
               warms Anderson's heart.

               Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting
               and examining protoplasmic tissue masses.  Other technicians
               peer through massive microscopes.  Still others use robotic
               arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass
               barriers.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You don't get out here much.

 ANDERSON                          Not my sort of place.

               Dr. Resfield emits a dry little laugh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          The head of Precrime squeamish?

 ANDERSON                          When it comes to needles and scalpels,
                         yeah.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I promise we won't use any on you.

 ANDERSON                          What do you use them on?

 DR. RESFIELD                               (beat)
                         On bits of this and that.

               Anderson looks at him.  The doctor pauses outside a thick
               door.  An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and
               the door opens with an electronic hiss.

               Anderson looks around the lab.  Technicians lower mesh
               cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT.  Another technician
               turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the
               roiling liquid.

 ANDERSON                          What's happening here?

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're in an interesting phase.

 ANDERSON                          What's in the cylinders?

 DR. RESFIELD                          Neurotissue.

 ANDERSON                          From ...?

 DR. RESFIELD                          A fusion of sources.  From the
                         Precogs' deceased mother.  From the
                         Precogs themselves.

 ANDERSON                          A fusion of ... ?

 DR. RESFIELD                          In lay terms, we mated sperm from
                         the brothers with ova from the mother
                         and sister to create new growth.

               The CYLINDERS shudder as the voltage is increased.

 DR. RESFIELD (CONT'D)                          And then we add mutating variables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. 

               Anderson stares into the roiling vat.  Dr. Resfield waits
               for more questions.  But it is clear from Anderson's
               expression he has already learned enough.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for
               premurders in the local Washington area. We stay on him as he
               watches the monitor.  He pops the disc, jots down some notes,
               slides in the next disc.

               Anderson's mouth slowly opens.  He leans close to the monitor,
               his face ashen.

 EXT. FRANK D'IGNAZIO'S BACKYARD -- LATER 
               Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden.
               He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich
               soil.

               He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate.  He
               lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile.  It's
 ANDERSON. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          What are you doing, playing hooky?

               Anderson tries to smile.  But it won't come.  He looks around
               the abundant garden.

 ANDERSON                          It's great out here, Frank.. You got
                         the touch.

               Frank straightens with a grimace.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          I got the arthritis, is what I got.

               Anderson reflexively looks up at a high WHINING sound from
               over head.  Frank follows his gaze.  A Precrime HOVERCRAFT
               glides into position overhead.

               Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground.  He takes
               a long sad breath.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          Ah shit, neighbor.
                              (beat)
                         Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,
                         do they?
                              (beat)
                         Can we do this inside?  Ellie's not
                         home.

               Anderson's voice is full of pain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. 

 ANDERSON                          Sure, Frank.  Yeah.

 INT. FRANK'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 


               Frank wanders the kitchen, trying to focus on his situation.
               Anderson has trouble meeting his friend's eyes.

               Through a window we can see black suited police officers
               with mirrored helmets swarming outside Frank's house.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (distracted)
                         I thought I'd buried it all.
                         Thirty-five years -- all those minutes
                         and days to bury it.
                              (beat)
                         But suddenly you see the man who
                         murdered your daughter walking the
                         streets -- my God it throws you.

               Frank stops pacing.  He stares at a kitchen drawer.

 ANDERSON                          He'd served his time, Frank.  I know
                         it's not fair.  It's way beyond not
                         fair ...

               Frank looks.  At Anderson bitterly.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (yells)
                         God damn the Precogs.  You know?
                         Why couldn't they have been around
                         to save my girl?
                              (softly)
                         Now they're catching me.

               Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          I really shoot the bastard, huh?
                         When?

 ANDERSON                          Next Wednesday, at noon.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Good.

               Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun.

 ANDERSON                          It's not in you, Frank, to kill
                         anybody.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28. 

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Tell it to the Precogs.  It's set in
                         stone now, right?

               Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter.  Anderson relaxes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (almost inaudible)
                         I don't want to be a part of this
                         world anymore.

 ANDERSON                          I know, Frank.

               Frank gives Anderson a look -- no, friend, you don't know.
               Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (beat)
                         So.  Tell me, Paul.  Do the Precogs
                         see everything?

 ANDERSON                          No.

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Then they won't have seen this.

               Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own
               head.  On Anderson's anguished FACE, at the SOUND of the gun
               going off.

 EXT. FRONT YARD -- LATER 
               Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's
               front porch.  Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa
               comforting Ellie D'Ignazio in the living room.

               Anderson is deeply shaken.  Witwer tries to talk him through
               it.

 WITWER (GENTLY)                          We had to bring him in.

               Anderson doesn't respond.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He was a future murderer.

 ANDERSON                               (angrily)
                         You blame him?  The guy killed his
                         daughter!

               Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Yeah.  I know.  I know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29. 

               Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body
               into the back of an ambulance.  Anderson's bitterness erupts.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in
                         them absolutely and I hate them
                         absolutely.  Jesus.

               Witwer listens to him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          And that goddamn lab trying to grow
                         more of them.  Put a Precog in every
                         home, you know?  So we can have more
                         Franks - people shooting themselves --
                         over who knows what?

               Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing
               tones like you'd calm an agitated horse.

 WITWER                          Precrime did the job it was supposed
                         to do.

               The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You know it.  And you believe in it.

 ANDERSON (BEAT)                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It's not easy.  It beats us down.
                         Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates
                         you right now.

               Anderson turns to Witwer.

 ANDERSON                          That's why I got into this business
                         -- to be hated.

               Anderson almost manages a small smile.  Witwer puts his arm
               around him.  Walks him away from the scene.

 WITWER                          They hated us when we were regular
                         cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they
                         still hate US.  It's one of the little
                         perks of law enforcement nobody knows
                         about.

               Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness.  Anderson looks
               into his partner's good, open face.  Then they both look
               away, their understanding of each other complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. 

 INT. ANDERSON'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT 
               Anderson stares out the window at Frank's house, illuminated
               by the moon.  It's a mournful sight.

               Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS-ALEXANDRIA-DAY - ONE WEEK LATER 
               Ennis Page, in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber,
               picks up a black BRIEFCASE marked: "Zone 218 Washington /
               Alexandria, VA." He approaches the door, and his eyes are
               scanned.  The door opens with a HISS.

               We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until
               he reaches a long hallway leading to the Director's office.
               Anderson's secretary, Angela, looks up on Page's approach.
               She nods.  He nods.

               He walks around her desk.  His eyes are scanned, and the
               door to Anderson's office opens.

               ANDERSON looks up, wearily.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- LATER 
               Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost
               absently.  As we have seen him do before, he swivels his
               chair away from the monitor, and stares at Washington D.C.
               across the Potomac.  Hovercrafts and transports skim through
               the sky above the Washington Monument.

               The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the
               Precog disc begins.  He hears his own voice speaking in
               strained, agitated tones.

 ANDERSON (O.S.)                          Let's not do this, Ed.

               Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and
               horror at the monitor.

 THE MONITOR 
               shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing
               guns directly at each other.  Their eyes intense and panicked.
               Who murders whom?

               Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red
               seconds tumble away.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31. 

               Witwer lowers his gun.  He stands unresisting before

               Anderson.

               Witwer sees his own death in Anderson's wild eyes, has always
               seen it.

               Anderson FIRES his weapon, puts a bullet straight into
               Witwer's heart, throwing him back against a wall.  Witwer
               slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads:

 5:20 AM. 
 BACK TO SCENE 
               Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank.  His hand
               goes to his mouth.  His body begins to shake.  He hugs
               himself, but he can't stop the shaking.

               The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor.  It is a small
               SOUND, but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it
               were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it.
               His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside
               his desk, like a man in need of prayer.

               There is a single thought that screams through his brain.
               It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly.
               Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I kill you.
                              (beat)
                         Oh god, I kill you.

               As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for
               the disc ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie,
               the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness.
               Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON.  They speak as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs
               fade into the mists ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE 
               Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his
               door.  Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED, the
               traffic outside, his own breathing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32. 

               His senses are on overload.

               The door begins to open.  A stockinged leg is the first thing
               Anderson sees.  His secretary, ANGELA.

 ANGELA                          Sir?

               She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs
               at the incriminating disc.  He sees his EYES reflected in
               its alloy surface.  He pushes the disc deep into his pants
               pocket.

               Somehow he finds his voice.

 ANDERSON                          Come in.  Angela.

               She looks at him, uncertain.  Then she places a small stack
               of papers on his desk.

 ANGELA                          Need you to sign these.  And your
                         eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.

 ANDERSON                          My ... eleven.

 ANGELA                               (beat)
                         Budget coordination with the FBI.
                              (beat)
                         You okay, sir?

               Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast
               enough.  He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case.
               He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks.

 ANDERSON                          Have Page take this.

               Angela steps back, disturbed.

 ANGELA                          But sir, the procedure

 ANDERSON (SNAPS)                          I make procedure.  Call him.
                              (long beat)
                         I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right.

               My head and stomach.  I'm going down to the clinic.  Or maybe
               just home.

               Angela looks relieved at the explanation.

 ANGELA                          Yes sir.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33. 

               He moves past her.  His FINGERS fidget against the hidden
               disc in his pocket.

 ANDERSON                          I'll speak to Witwer, put him in
                         charge for the rest of the day.

               He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and
               at his view of Washington.  Then he is gone.

 INT. OUTSIDE WITWER'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office.  He
               takes a step inside.

               Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling
               him.

 WITWER                          Breaking and entering.  That'll get
                         you five to ten, hard.

               Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          What's wrong?

               Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes.  He
               REACHES into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the
               light.  If he could just do that, show it to Witwer.

 WITWER                          Paul?

               Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket, EMPTY.

 ANDERSON                          Take over for me today?

 WITWER                          You sick?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

               Witwer makes a show of backing away.

 WITWER                          Don't give it to me.  You probably
                         have that Trans-10 virus going around.
                         A stomach thing.  I hate stomach
                         things.

               Anderson Almost smiles.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34. 

 WITWER                          Yeah?

               Witwer looks at him.  Anderson almost reaches out for him.

 ANDERSON                          Run the place, okay?

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         Sure.  Right into the ground.
                              (beat)
                         Go on home before I call Infectious
                         Control and have them spray you down
                         with something.

               Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway.  Witwer calls
               out.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You want me to do the discs, or hold
                         them for you to review when you get
                         back?

 ANDERSON                          Can't let them back up.  Do 'em.

 WITWER                          Call you later.  Take it easy, all
                         right?

               Witwer lifts his hand in farewell, Anderson fixes on that
               last image -- Witwer waving goodbye.

 INT. PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER 
               Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar
               and pulls out a cell phone.  He hits a button.

 INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON / LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa sits in a meeting.  Her phone CHIRPS softly.  She glances
               at the display, then rises to take it.  She goes to a corner
               of the room.

 LISA                          Paul?

 ANDERSON                          Listen to me.

               Lisa presses her phone close to her ear.

 LISA                          I can hardly hear you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35. 

 ANDERSON                          I'm underground.  Weakens the signal
                         so it can't be picked up.

               Alarm moves across her face.

 LISA                          But we're on Secure

 ANDERSON                          Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder
                         Ed.

               The Precogs picked it up.

               On Lisa -- can she have heard right?

 LISA                          Paul.  Paul His crackling voice
                         faintly comes through the phone.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          ... home.

               Lisa's phone goes dead.

 BACK TO ANDERSON 
               Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground
               transports.  They are sleek and menacing, the black shells
               lumpy with dangerous gadgetry.  In the distance, a POLICE
               OFFICER, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of
               one of them.

               He looks up at Anderson's approach.  He puts his equipment
               down, and salutes.

 POLICE OFFICER                          Hello, sir.

               Anderson nods, moves close.

 ANDERSON                          What's your name, officer?

 POLICE OFFICER                          Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.

 ANDERSON                          These the new Python transports?

               The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride,
               is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova
               stun gun to the base of his neck.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (sincerely)
                         Sorry, Officer Smythe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36. 

               The officer buckles.  Anderson catches him, rolls him gently
               into the back of the transport.

               Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins
               stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black
               uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic
               scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess
               at.

               Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey FOOTSTEPS.  They
               approach, then fade away.

               Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then
               aims a nozzled cylinder at them.  He shoots a spray of blue
               BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor
               of the transport in an adhesive glob.

               Then he leaves the scene, running.

 INT. ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95.
               The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering
               wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his
               direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now.

               From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn
               and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his
               steering wheel.

               Anderson slams it with his fist.  Through his windshield
               Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a
               passing red and black Ford.  His mother sits in the
               passenger's seat, blithely reading.  The boy mimics Anderson,
               gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs.

               Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance,
               at the "Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington
               D.C. You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in
               there.

 EXT. POTOMAC PARK 
               Anderson stands on an embankment.  He holds the Precog disc
               in his hand, ready to throw it into the river.

               He stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop.
               He doesn't do it.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER 
               Lisa enters the house, in a rush.  Every shade is drawn.
               Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely
               motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.

 ANDERSON                          Don't move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37. 

               Lisa doesn't get it.  She continues toward him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Stop!  Moving heats you up, makes it
                         easier for them to pick you up on
                         their thermals.

               She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks.  She is
               suddenly suffocating.

 LISA                          It's a hundred degrees in here.

 ANDERSON                          I turned the furnace all the way up.
                         Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they
                         come, it'll buy me twenty seconds.
                         Maybe thirty.

 LISA                          Nobody's coming for you.

               Anderson stares at her.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          On the phone -- what you said.  It's
                         impossible.

               She shakes her head in disbelief.  Anderson speaks, choking
               on the words.

 ANDERSON                          I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.

 LISA                          It's not true.

               Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair.
               We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm.  He seems about
               to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet.  He keeps staring at
               her intently.  Something is holding him back.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You're upset.  You've been unhappy.
                         There's a lot of pressure on you.
                         And then Frank ...

 ANDERSON                          One week from today.  Tuesday, June
                         25, at five-twenty in the morning.
                         I shoot him, Lisa.

 LISA                               (beat)
                         You need to take time off.

               Anderson laughs harshly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. 

 ANDERSON                          You don't have to worry about that.

               She steps toward him.

 LISA                               (gently)
                         I want to hold you.

 ANDERSON                          If you love me, stand there.  And
                         don't move.

               Tears well in her eyes.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the disc, Lisa.  I shoot him.
                         In the chest.  And he dies.  I've
                         watched a thousand murders.  This
                         time I star in one.

 LISA                          Something's wrong.  You wouldn't do
                         it.

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs are never wrong.  They
                         emit a single disc.  "The immutable
                         evidence of the infallible system."

               The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway
               unsteadily.

               Anderson focuses on her.  Her face.  Her hair ...

 LISA                          We'll figure this out.  We'll review
                         the system.

 ANDERSON                          There is no review.  There's only
                         the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's
                         no defense.

               Her long hair.  He stares.

 LISA                          You can't run.  Please, let's --

               A SOUND outside.  They both turn.  A deep silence.  The
               furnace churns out heat.  And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair
               ... and finally understands.

               Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the DISC back
               into his pocket.  He rises from his chair.  For the first
               time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. 

 ANDERSON                          Last week.  It was strange.  I watched
                         from the bathroom window.  You went
                         out in the backyard to make a call.

               She looks at him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          An appointment, you said.  For a
                         haircut that afternoon.

               Lisa's hand jumps to her hair.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          You didn't get your hair cut.  You
                         went to the trouble of calling first
                         thing in the morning.  It was that
                         important ...

               She reaches for him.  He pulls away.

 LISA                          Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're
                         panicking.  Everything's going to
                         look wrong.  You're going to distrust
                         everybody and everything now.

               Lisa implores him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You can't distrust me.
                              (beat)
                         It was Ed I called.

               Anderson cocks his head.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it?

 LISA                          Stop being a cop and listen to me!

               A booming, electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates
               the walls of the house from outside.

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Director Anderson!  There is no
                         escape!

               Anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife.  She's frantic.

 LISA                          Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted
                         to...

               But be's already on the move, running for the upstairs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40. 

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Drop to your hands and knees and
                         stay there.  Precrime is entering
                         your house!

               Lisa screams, as her front door is sonically BLASTED off its
               hinges, and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets
               hurtle in.

 LISA                          Paul!

	       They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the 
               stairs like a disease in fast motion.

 UPSTAIRS 
               Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out,
               scanning rooms for thermal presence.

               An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room.  He speaks, his voice
               electronically altered.

 OFFICER 1                          He's got a hair dryer going.  Screwed
                         up my reading.

               The others nod.

 OFFICER 2                          We're not picking up shit.

               They rush into rooms, with increased urgency.  We follow
               OFFICER 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the
               stairs.

               He hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is
               awash in personnel.  Lisa stands against the wall, pale and
               shaken.  He looks at her for a long beat, then steps over
               the shattered door and out into the sunlight.

 OUTSIDE 
               Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm.
               But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has
               kicked.  Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it,
               engines WHINING.  Black Python transports are all over the
               street out in front, and more keep coming.

               And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police.  OFFICER
               I approaches a Python ground transport.  Another officer
               guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left.  He
               settles on OFFICER 1's approach and raises his weapon.

               OFFICER 1 doesn't even break stride.  He walks right up to
               the guard -- and then right through him.  A holograph decoy.
               OFFICER 1 enters the Python.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41. 

 INSIDE THE PYTHON 
               OFFICER 1 removes his helmet -- it's Anderson.  And then
               comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his
               IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet?

               A little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes
               a red beam into his eyes.  Anderson presses his lips together.
               The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson 0256 clear.

               Anderson grips the steering wheel.  But his time, since it
               is a law enforcement.  Vehicle, the steering actually works.
               Anderson pulls out.

               FROM ABOVE, as the Python transport slips away from the chaos.

               THEN HIGHER, and we see that the direction the Python is
               headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through
               the white of Washington, and into the dark of The Sprawl.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 


               Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber.  He stares at an
               oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor.

               He runs both hands through his hair.  He is tired, his eyes
               weary, lost.

               A voice comes over the intercom.

 VOICE                          Enter now please, Assistant Director
                         Witwer.

               Witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door.

 INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM 
               Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table.

               Powerful men sit at the other end of the table.  SWANSON,
               sharp-boned, the FBI Director.  CRONIN, awl-like eyes, the
               CIA Director.  Senator Malcolm.  Chief Justice POLLARD, whose
               face reveals nothing.  Vice-President ALMER, whose tongue
               darts across his dry lips unsettlingly.  Unpleasant looking
               men in an unpleasant mood.

               Cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares
               at Witwer.

 CIA CRONIN                          The central question is: Why does
                         Anderson want to kill Witwer?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42. 

               Cronin holds up the printout.

 CIA CRONIN (CONT'D)                          We checked your finances.  His
                         finances.  Nothing irregular, you
                         don't steal from him, he doesn't
                         steal from you.  You haven't done
                         anything that he might have
                         discovered, and vice versa.

               Swanson holds up another sheath of papers.

 FBI SWANSON                          Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
                         coups planned by you to topple him.
                              (beat)
                         He's done nothing to you, or you to
                         him.

               Witwer presses his lips together.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          You fucking his wife?

 WITWER                          No.

 FBI SWANSON HIS MOTHER? HIS BROTHER? 
               Witwer gives him a bad look.

 FBI SWANSON (CONT'D)                          Okay.  There we are.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          So, you are friends, partners, and
                         soul mates.  Anderson has no motive.

 WITWER                          I can't think of one.
                              (beat)
                         Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
                         are mistaken?

               Witwer looks away.  Jesus, he wants out of this room.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You don't believe that, do you?

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         No.  The Precogs are infallible.

               Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43. 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen
                         -screw the motive.  We got a
                         pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty
                         little PR problem.

               The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And here is our solution.  You are
                         now Director Witwer.

               Witwer shakes his head, starts to protest.  Almer silences
               him with a raised finger.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONT'D)                          Precrime must demonstrate its
                         willingness to go after one of its
                         own.  Total impartiality.

 WITWER                          Now look--

               Cronin talks right over him.

 CIA CRONIN                          The public must believe that every
                         future murderer is pursued with equal
                         vigor.

 FBI SWANSON                          Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
                         the man best suited to the job.  And
                         who would pursue a murderer harder
                         ... than his intended victim?

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You went after Anderson yesterday
                         -because it was right, and because
                         you believe.

               Almer speaks with a tight irony.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And your belief will certainly grow
                         stronger with each tick of the clock.

               Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred.  But he
               does not deny their words.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          Haw long will it take, Director?

               Wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the
               task he can't avoid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44. 

 WITWER                          He knows Precrime, of course.  And
                         the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll
                         remember how to work them.  It'll
                         come back to him fast.  He's ... the
                         best.

               Witwer almost smiles.  Justice Pollard's not smiling.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          We're not here to praise Caesar --
                         we're here to bury him.

               Witwer looks at Pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his
               right eye.

 WITWER                          He can't avoid iris identification.
                         Every door he opens, every ATM he
                         uses, or taxi or transport he boards
                         -- he'll get scanned.
                              (quietly)
                         It won't take long to find him.  

	       The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL NIGHT 
               The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all
               feels different than it did in the suburbs.  Where the burbs
               were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy.

               The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them.
               The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's
               suits have some shine at the elbows.  You look over your
               shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less.

               And some streets you don't go on at all.  Anderson's Python
               moves down one of them.  He stops under a blackened suspension
               bridge, gets out.  He's still in uniform.  He holds a duffel
               bag.

               He starts to walk away from the Python, then hesitates.
               He's left the door open.  He shakes his head at his
               sloppiness.  Goes back and shuts the door.  Walks away again.

 INSIDE THE CAR 
               He's left a small DEVICE on the passenger's seat.  Digital
               numbers shoot by in reverse.  Something CLICKS.

 OUTSIDE THE CAR 
               Anderson continues walking away.  He doesn't look back as
               the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame.
               It's not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesn't explode.
               It just ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 45. 

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS - -- NIGHT LATER 
               Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and
               dresses hanging in clear plastic bags.  He gets to work on
               the door.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
               Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark.  She listens to an
               almost inaudible sound, a high WHINE.

 EXT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE 
               A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house, a dark
               moon in the low clouds.

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS -- EARLY MORNING 
               A worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the
               clean clothes piled on the floor.  It almost looks like a
               nest, like someone slept there

 EXT. SUBWAY LATER 
               Anderson, in a blue suit and fedora, carrying his duffel
               bag, stands on a subway platform.  He takes out a cell phone,
               dials a number.  He looks up at the SOUND of a train.

               The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front
               car: "33rd Street Express."

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer moves up and down the aisles,
               past technicians who man computers and holographic tracking
               displays.

               A Precrime TECHNICIAN 1 suddenly sits upright.  Witwer picks
               him out of the crowd and zeroes in.

 TECHNICIAN                          It's Anderson.

               Witwer grabs a phone, punches a button

 WITWER                          Paul! 
                The technicians scramble to pinpoint Anderson on a
               Glowing holographic MAP.

 CUT TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 46. 

 EXT. SUBWAY STATION 
               Anderson, holding his phone, is IdentiScanned along with
               everyone else as he steps onto the train.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Another TECHNICIAN 2 calls out to Witwer.  Witwer covers his
               phone mouthpiece.

 TECHNICIAN 2                          He's been Scanned.  He's on the 33rd
                         Street Subway!

               TECHNICIAN 1 Calls from the other side of the room

 TECHNICIAN                          His cell phone tracks for The Sprawl.
                         We got him on the Subway, too!

 CUT TO: 
 INT. SUBWAY CAR 
               Anderson sits on a seat in the rear of the car.

 ANDERSON                          Why am I going to kill you,Ed?

 INTERCUT:ANDERSON ON THE SUBWAY /WITWER AT PRECRIME 
 WITWER                          There's no motive

 ANDERSON                          My wife calling you before breakfast?

 WITWER                          We were planning a surprise party.
                         It was going to be today.
                              (beat, ironic)
                         Happy birthday, partner.

 ANDERSON                          This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell
                         of a surprise, though.
                              (beat)
                         I'm having trouble trusting people,
                         Ed, I gotta tell you.

               At Precrime, they upload a MAP DISPLAY of the Express train's
               route.  We see a blue light moving -- the train.  And two
               separate red dots along its route.

               An OFFICER points at the dots, and speaks to Witwer in a low
               voice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 47. 

 OFFICER                          The train makes two stops, here and
                         here: 20th, then 33rd Street.

               Witwer covers the Mouthpiece

 WITWER                               (to the officer)
                         Split the units, go to both

 OFFICER                          We'll never make 20th 

		Witwer waves him away -- do your job.  Now.

 ANDERSON                          You there, Ed?

 WITWER                          I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul .

 ANDERSON                          I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive.

 WITWER                          Come in.  We'll figure this thing
                         out together.

 INT. THE SUBWAY TRAIN 
               Anderson looks out the window into the tunnel dark.  He talks
               to Witwer.

 INTERCUT: ANDERSON/WITWER 
 WITWER                          It'll get ugly if you keep running.
                         And your eyes, Paul -- every move
                         you make a Scanner will pinpoint you
                         for us.

 ANDERSON                          I saw a news flash.  You're the new
                         Director.  Is that the point of this?

 WITWER                          Fuck you.

               Anderson smiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 48. 

 ANDERSON                          Didn't think so.  But it has to be
                         something, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the DISPLAY MAP.  We see the blue train
               nearing its first stop, 20th street.  We see two waves of
               lighted green dots -- Precrime units heading for 20th and
               33rd.

 WITWER                          Paul.  Come in.

               Anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train: "Next
               Stop 20th Street.

 ANDERSON                          If I come in, it puts me close to
                         you.  If I get close ... I may kill
                         you.  I can't risk that.
                              (beat)
                         Anyway, they'd force you to lock me
                         up.  And that'd be it -- I'd never
                         get my chance to solve this thing.

               Witwer needs to keep him talking

 WITWER                          You're kinds liking this, in a way,
                         aren't you?  The action ...

 ANDERSON                          And you get to be a real cop again.
                         We get to flex our muscles.

               Anderson's train is just finishing off-loading passengers.
               The doors close and the train begins to pull out as the first
               helmeted Precrime officers flood the platform.

               One of them points.

 CLOSE ON: A TRAIN WINDOW 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 49. 

               Anderson is visible through the window, talking on his cell
               phone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT.PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Witwer stares at the map.  The train has stopped at 20th
               street.  But Anderson's still talking.  He isn't getting off
               -- he's going on to 33rd Street, the last stop.

               Technician 2 presses his earphone close, listens, then calls
               over to Witwer.  Witwer covers his mouthpiece.

 TECHNICIAN 2                          We have visual verification -- he's
                         still on the train.

               Witwer gives him a thumb's up.  We STAY ON Witwer as he
               listens to Anderson, and watches his train move toward 33rd
               on the MAP.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I want to tell you something, partner.
                         You listening?

               Witwer nods.  Now the MAP shows all the Precrime units
               swarming toward the 33rd Street subway station.

 WITWER                          Yeah.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I gotta do this.  I have to figure
                         this thing out.
                              (beat)
                         But listen to me now.  If it was you
                         running, I'd come after you, Ed.

               Witwer stares at the MAP, at all the units he's sent after
               his friend.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          You're a cop.  And I'm a future
                         murderer.

                         Do your job, Ed. Come after me hard.
                         Because, Jesus Christ, I wouldn't
                         sleep or eat until I had tracked you
                         down and put a gun to your head.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Witwer watches on the MAP at all the little symbols merging
               together, like a gameboard -- but this game ends in a reallife
               confrontation between one man and an army of them.

 WITWER                          You wouldn't shoot a cop would you,
                         Paul?

	       He looks urgently to the phone technician

 TECHNICIAN 1                          He's still on the line.

               Witwer presses his ear to the phone.  He can hear the subway
               make its STOP.  Then he hears a chorus of mechanized VOICES
               -the voices of the Precrime police, the SCREAMS of panicked
               passengers

 VOICES ON ANDERSON'S PHONE                          Police.  Everyone down on your hands

               Anderson begins to shimmer, then dematerialize ghost-like,
               into nothingness.  He was a holographic decoy.

               What is actually there on the train seat is Anderson's cell
               phone.  Rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice
               recorder.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 51. 

 EXT. STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 


               Every city has its underbelly.  If you lifted the fat dark
               underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up.

               The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight.  There
               are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its
               source, never makes it through the sour air down to the
               ground.

               The retro fifties look comes apart here.  The people that
               you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they
               move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting
               tech-fibers.

               ANDERSON'S caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black.
               Anderson has him pinned up against a wall.  They're having
               some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering
               none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder
               against the wall.

               Finally, the guy does something odd.  He lifts a finger and
               pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid.  Anderson lets
               him.  Then the guy does the same on the left.  Has a long
               look.  And then nods.  Anderson releases him, and they go
               off together.

 EXT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER 
               An oppressive brick thing on a side street.  The facade is
               crumbling.  Nothing good happens in a building like this..

               The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off
               into the night.

 INT. ROOM -- LATER 
               A stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little
               kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink.

               But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift
               hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array
               of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia
               console.

               Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC.  DOC is a big man with
               delicate fingers.  He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into
               a handkerchief.

 DOC                          Got a cold.

               Anderson looks at him uneasily.  It's not just DOC -- it's
               the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing,
               which Anderson truly does not care for.  Doc sneezes again,
               then looks up at his patient.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          Don't worry.  I could cut open your
                         chest, sew a dead cat in there, and
                         you'd never get an infection.  Not
                         with the spectrum antibios I'll be
                         shooting into you.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.

               Doc chuckles.  Then he waits, expectantly.

               Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card.  A preset cash
               card.  DOC slides it into small console, watches the numbers
               flash up.  He frowns, sighs.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          It's all I could safely move

               He waits.  Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.

 DOC                          Yeah.  All right.

               Time to got down to business.  Doc walks over to a large
               medical cabinet and opens the door.  It's full of EYES, and
               parts of eyes -- 611 !  A cryo-jars.

               Anderson tightens.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          You understand what I told you then.
                         I can't just give you new irises.
                         The Scanners will read the scar
                         tissue.  Alarms will go off.

 ANDERSOIN                          I'm a cop, I know

 DOC                          I gotta take your eyes out.

               Anderson knows this, too, wishes Doc would shut up ANDERSON
               Yeah.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          And put in new ones.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  I get it, DOC.

               Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the
               operating table.  He lies down.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Do me quick before I run out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. 

               Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling.  He listens
               to Doc preparing instrument trays.  It's a bad sound.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the
               Python transport.  Witwer stands watching as a Precrime
               techno-unit sifts through the white ashes.

               Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the
               Potomac.  It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing
               the air for a scent.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see
               anything either.  He's in a deep post-surgical haze.  DOC'S
               voice comes to him.  It's warped and ugly.

 DOC'S VOICE                          Don't take the bandages off for twenty
                         four hours.  You'll go blind if you
                         do.

               Anderson makes an affirmative grunt. Now we see his
               surroundings, even though Anderson still can't.  He lies in
               a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings.
               Doc stands over him.

 DOC                          You're in a room.  I had you moved
                         here, a couple miles from my place.
                         If they find you, they don't find
                         me.

               Anderson grunts weakly.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          A guy will come in, feed you once.
                              (beat)
                         I juiced up the nano-reconstruction
                         around your new eyes, 'cause I know
                         you're in a hurry.

 ANDERSON                               (Fuzzily))
                         Nano-re ...construction.

 DOC                          Organic microrobots that reconstruct
                         nerves and blood vessels.  It'll
                         feel like fleas chewing on your
                         eyeballs.  Don't scratch.

               Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages.
               Doc forces them away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm giving you a bonus, might come
                         in handy.  Feel this.

               Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to
               Anderson's hand.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          It's a temporary paralytic enzyme.
                         Someone spots you, you duck into an
                         alley, shoot this under your chin.

               Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's
               chin.  Anderson jumps.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          The enzyme turns your facial muscles
                         to mush.  You won't look like the
                         same man.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus.

 DOC                          You tighten up again in about thirty
                         minutes.  Hurts like nothing you
                         ever felt.  It's vicious, but
                         effective.  I'll put it in your bag.

               Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places
               it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm setting up a timer.  When it
                         buzzes tomorrow, take off your
                         bandages, and get the hell out of
                         here.

               Anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he
               hears a door open and close, and Doc is gone.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               The Precrime presence mounts on the streets.  A couple of
               units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold.
               He looks like a hostage.  He is sweating.  Keeps reaching
               for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to.

               He speaks to someone we don't yet see.  The guy DOC said
               would come.

 ANDERSON                          I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Guess I should eat.  
				(Beat) 
			 You gonna help feed me?

               Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent
               to help Anderson.  It's the rat guy, the thin bald man
               Anderson had roughed up the day before.  The guy has a bowl
               of hot soup in his hands.  He stares contemptuously at
               Anderson.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          So how do we do this, pal?

               The rat guy doesn't say a word.  He simply tips the hot soup
               and it splatters down into Anderson's lap.  Anderson cries
               out in pain and surprise.  The guy walks out of the room.

 CLOSE ON- THE TIMER 
               Twenty hours gone by.  Four more to go.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch,
               looking for leads, looking for anything.

 INT. THE BOARDING ROOM 
               The TIMER shows one hour to go.  Anderson sits in a chair,
               squirming miserably.  His dressings are wet with sweat, and
               frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked
               at them.

 ANDERSON                               (to himself)
                         Fuck.

               He is this close to ripping the dressings off

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY 
               A Precrime transport stops.  Two officers get out.  One of
               them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and
               does a read on the boarding house.  The other does a read on
               a pawn shop and bar next door..

               The OFFICER 1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the
               other officer.

 OFFICER 1                          Got 27 warm bodies in this place.
                         What should it take, three or four
                         Spiders?

 OFFICER 2                          Do four.  Speed things up, so we can
                         go eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. 

               The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport, and takes out
               a box.  He removes four round BALLS.  They are silver, as
               big as billiard balls.

               He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and
               the front door opens.  He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.

               Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against
               it, bored.  He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits
               for the data to come in.

 INT. THE BUILDING 
               The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to
               autolife as they spin.  They open like flowers -- flowers
               with legs.

 CLOSE ON : A BALL 
               A fist-sized Spider takes shape.  On its head is an IdentiScan
               lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna.

 INT. A ROOM 
               An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something
               unidentifiable.  She looks up with annoyance as she sees a
               spider scuttling across the floor toward her.  It makes a
               CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes.  She's poor, living
               in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill.  She continues to eat
               as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table.  She barely
               watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand.

 OLD WOMAN                          It's nice to have a little company

               She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her
               am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder.  It grips
               her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes.

               Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away
               across the linoleum.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column
               with his laser pen, and waits for the next one.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson sits in his chair.  He cocks his head, listening.
               His body tenses.  Something feels wrong.

               The TIMER shows ten minutes to go.  Blindfolded for a day
               and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left.
               Three seconds, four hours?

               A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door.  Anderson tenses
               as it CLICKS across the floor toward him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. 

               He knows that sound.

               Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair.  He starts to
               grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops
               himself.  The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS
               toward him again.

               Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider.  He is
               dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.  The Spider
               comes faster.  Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down.
               Falls across the bed.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard.  One of the Spiders
               is taking too long.  He adjusts his thermal scanner, and
               sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room.

               The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the
               barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1. They both watch the
               screen.

 OFFICER 1                          Stinking drunk.

 OFFICER 2                               (beat)
                         Or a guy who doesn't want to get
                         read.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the
               consequences.  The Spider advances, starts up his leg.

               The TIMER has not buzzed.  Anderson can't touch his dressings.
               The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face.  It
               WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the
               dressings.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their
               mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get
               past the dressings for a read.

               Anderson has no choice.  None.  He starts to lift at his
               dressing.  The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in
               place.

               Anderson wants to scream.  He unwraps his head, tugs the eye
               pads away from his eyes.  He rips them off.  The Spider sits
               on his shoulder, waiting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. 

               Anderson's eyes are tightly closed.  He opens them

 ANDERSON'S POV - BLINDING LIGHT 
               Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear
               flashpoint.  Light to buckle the knees and push the brain
               beyond endurance.

               And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off.
               The TIMER has finally sounded.  Anderson's open eyes are
               streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE ROOM 
               It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his
               eyes.  Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps
               off his shoulder, and crosses the floor.  It flattens, scoots
               under the door, and is gone.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read.  They
               pull off their helmets.

 OFFICER 1                          Let's eat.

               They start putting their equipment back into the transport.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror.  His new eyes
               are tender and bloodshot.  And they are not blue, like the
               ones he was born with, but a deep brown.  Anderson is exactly
               the same, and utterly different.

               He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTER'S -- DAY 
               Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office.
               Witwer isn't looking too well, either.

 WITWER                          They told me to move into Paul's
                         office.  I said fuck you very much.

               Lisa nods.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (softly)
                         I don't want to do any of this, Lisa.

 LISA                          I know.  I know that.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Everybody's got their reasons for
                         wanting you in charge.  So do I --
                         you won't bring him in dead.

 WITWER                          Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ...
                              (beat)
                         Which is what he does four days from
                         now, isn't it?

               Witwer's eyes imp involuntarily to a CLOCK on his desk.

 LISA                          He'd never hurt you.

 WITWER                          I know that.  But the other thing I
                         know is -- the Precogs are never
                         wrong.

               The words are leading them no place good.  They stop talking,
               and just sit there.

 INT. THE SPRAWL 
               Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with
               several people waiting for the N0.6 Turbo Tram.

               The double decker Tram comes.  People get off, then the line
               starts to move forward as people get on.

               Anderson fidgets.  He's last in line.  Each person gets
               IdentiScanned as he boards.  Anderson's putting his new eyes
               to the test.  If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself
               to run.

               The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare.
               Anderson's turn.  Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam
               reads his eyes.

               The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering
               wheel, then nods at him.

 DRIVER                          Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty
                         of seats in the back.

               Anderson nods, moves casually to the back.  But his jaw
               muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension.

 INT. A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT 
               Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he
               finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den.  He
               wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos
               adorning the cherry wood walls.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60. 

               He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford
               to.  No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors.
               No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary
               or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand.

               Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small
               SOUND at ear level, coming from just behind him.  It's a
               metallic CLICK-CLICK.  He turns amiably.  His eyes instantly
               widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into
               the barrel of ANDERSON'S cocked gun.

 ANDERSON                          Time to upgrade your alarm system,
                         Senator.

               Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure.  His fear
               embarrasses him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Your work-up of Witwer.  The Security
                         Panel would've done one.
                              (beat)
                         Why do I kill Witwer?

               The Senator finds his voice.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          There's no motive.

 ANDERSON                          There's, always a motive.

               Anderson presses the gun to the Senator's forehead.  He slides
               the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty
               skin.  It makes a greasy red mark.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I could've come to anyone on the
                         panel.  But I picked you.
                              (beat)
                         Of all the shits on that panel, I
                         like you least of all.  So if this
                         gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but
                         not, you know, devastated.

               You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm.

               And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns
               and walks to the other side of the den.  His tone is mocking.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          What the fuck was I worried about?
                         You can't kill me.  The Precogs
                         would've seen it.

               Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun.  The Senator is
               even laughing now.  For a moment Anderson does nothing, then
               he moves toward the Senator again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61. 

               The Senator stands his ground smugly.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Witwer's clean.  You're clean.
                         There's nothing.  No motive.  Kind
                         of like something Kafka would've
                         cooked up.
                              (beat)
                         You like that, cockroach?  You're
                         fucked and you'll never know why.

               The Senator is laughing hard now.  Anderson lets him.

 ANDERSON                          Tell you something about the Precogs,
                         Senator.  They're great on murder.
                         But it's the little things they fail
                         to see.

               Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the
               floor and into the cherry wood panelling.  Several of his
               beloved photos crash down onto him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Little things like that, for instance.

               Anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer stands there amidst all of
               the technology speaking to a group of Precrime officers.

 WITWER                          He hasn't shown up on one goddamn
                         IdentiScan in three days.

               No one says anything, and then LIEUTENANT GLASER, 30, speaks
               up.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          He's found a room -- he's going to
                         sit it out.

 WITWER                          Yeah, except for holding a gun to
                         senator Malcolm's goddman head in
                         his own goddman house last night,
                         Anderson's sitting it out!
                              (beat)
                         Why hasn't he been scanned?

               The officers look at their shoes.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Why is he invisible?  He's moving
                         around but he isn't being seen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62. 

               Lieutenant Glaser tries again.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Hes beating the scanners

 WITWER                          No one beats the scanners.

               Witwer reaches up, wearily, rubbing his face and eyes with
               his hands.  The fingers dragging across his eyes stop.  Then
               his hands drop away, and he looks at his men.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's done his eyes

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          But the scarring always

 WITWER                          He went the whole way.  The crazy
                         bastard had his eyes removed.  New
                         ones sewn in.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          That takes weeks to heal.

 WITWER                          If you're prepared to go blind, a
                         street surgeon'll juice up the repair
                         cycle.  They don't give a fuck about
                         risk.

               Witwer's eyes flick to a digital CLOCK on the wall.  It's
               something he can't help doing now.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's going to do what it takes to
                         stay free -- if it blinds him, maims
                         him, or kills him.

               Witwers admiring smile makes his men very uncomfortable .

 INT. KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY 
               A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her
               teenage son.  He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts
               the carton down in front of him.

               There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton,
               about the size of a playing card.  AS the sleepy kid watches,
               the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life.

               Nothing unusual, they always do that.  For advertisements,
               lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins.

               A good one.  The kid straightens up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 63. 

 THE VID-SCREEN 
               A fully rotating mug shot of PAUL ANDERSON fills the screen,
               followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime
               he's been charged with.

               The kid watches for a while, then gets bored, and pulls the
               Dexi-Pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of
               that.

 INT. A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn
               perched on his belly.  He stares at a TV monitor that's the
               size of a twin bed.

 TV 
               Anderson's face fills the monitor.  The TV image is so big
               that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence.
               It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to
               avoid Him you can't.

               The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that.  He surfs
               through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is
               omnipresent.

 EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson's face fills the skies, too.  Witwer and Precrime
               have pulled out all the stops.

               Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it.
               Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air.  There
               are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the
               weather, a special type of cloud.

               People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go
               about their business.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL 
               One person who is paying deep attention to all this is
               Anderson himself.  He stands on a street corner, wearing
               dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk.

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a
               Precrime SPOKESWOMAN.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          The United States Supreme Court has
                         issued a special injunction allowing
                         the unprecedented public viewing of
                         former Precrime Director Paul
                         Anderson's future murder of Edward
                         Witwer, the current Director.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. 

 ANDERSON                          His mouth slowly opens.  He steps
                         back against a wall and slides his
                         hand into his pants pocket.  He looks
                         at the Precog DISC in his cupped
                         hand, then quickly puts it away.

               He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather
               around excitedly.

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky, in store windows, at
               other video kiosks.  They have the enthralled anticipation
               of a mob at a public guillotining.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          She continues her declamation

 SPOKESWOMAN (CONT'D)                          The video you are about to see,
                         generated by the Precognitive mutants,
                         is the immutable evidence of the
                         infallible system.
                              (reassuring smile)
                         Citizens are urged to call
                         1-800-PRECRIME with any information
                         that may lead us to the whereabouts
                         of Paul Anderson, future murderer.

 ANDERSON                          Shakes his head in confusion and
                         disbelief.  But he has the Precog
                         disc ...

               The OLD GUY him nudges him

 OLD GUY                          This oughtta be good, huh?

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing
               guns at each other.  The whole thing just as we saw it before.
               All the way through to the fatal moment.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

               Anderson shoots him.  Witwer slumps, dying.  The video stops.
               And then begins to play all over again, right from the start,
               the 1-800-PRECRIME number scrolling along the bottom of it.
               "Call now!  Call now!  Call now!

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Moves quickly through the crowds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 65. 

 INT. BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so
               full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting
               life.  But it supports the kind of life Page is interested
               in.

               An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool
               beside Page.  He gives one shake of his head, and she slides
               away again.  His eyes cut to a group of females.  He waits
               for the next approach.

 CLOSE ON: PAGE 
               as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc
               on the bar in front of him.  Page makes a sound and tries to
               jump away, as if the disc is something lethal.  Which it is,
               in a way.

               Anderson presses him back down on his stool.  Sits next to
               him.  Page stares at him, scared.  Anderson looks straight
               ahead as he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          "Ennis Page engages the services of
                         prostitutes because his relationships
                         with them compound his feelings of
                         selfloathing."
                              (beat)
                         Direct quote from your psychological
                         profile -- the kind of shit I had to
                         know as your former boss.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          "Page is an obsessive-compulsive
                         Type Nine." Another quote.  Niners
                         are great for the kind of work you
                         do -- keeping all those Precog discs
                         in order.

               You can almost see Page's heart slamming in his chest.  He
               tries to hide it with tough talk.

 PAGE                          I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so
                         what?

 ANDERSON                          Something's out of order, Ennis.
                         Deeply out of order.

               Page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar PAGE You got a
               disc Anderson picks it up, holds it tight in his fist

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Not A disc.  The disc.  When I went
                         home sick, I stole it.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 66. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I took it with me, Ennis.  I wasn't
                         sick, I was running with the evidence.
                              (lets that sink in)
                         So how is it that Precrime has one,
                         too?

 PAGE                               (utterly baffled)
                         You can't make copies 

	       Anderson waits.  Lets Page work through it.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          It's the basis of the system.  The
                         immutable evidence.  Copies are
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         You went home.  A little later, I
                         came in with a disc for Mr. Witwer
                         to review.  I wasn't halfway out the
                         door when he cried out.

               Anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          He was in shock.  He showed me.  It
                         was you shooting him.  Then all hell
                         broke loose.  He had to send the
                         Precrime units to your house.

 ANDERSON                          Ennis -- you gave out the same disc
                         twice.  Less than an hour apart.
                         The one I stole.  And then another
                         one.  Of the same event.

 PAGE                          It's impossible.  The Precogs can
                         only move forward to new events.
                         Into the future.  They never repeat.

               Anderson looks around.  Patrons are beginning to look over
               in his direction, eyes lingering.  He rises.

               Page seems in a daze.  As an obsessive-compulsive niner, the
               concept of an untidy system is disorienting.

               Anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't.

               On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned.  An automatic
               DIGITAL VOICE calls out after him.

 DIGITAL VOICE                          Have a nice night, Mr. Symington

	       Anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of The Sprawl.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 67. 

 INT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A YOUNG GUY with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone.
               He picks up, the receiver and immediately gets IdentiScanned.
               A light goes on, he's about to dial.

               Anderson appears out of nowhere, shoulders him out of the
               way.  The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back
               onto the sidewalk.  Anderson grabs the hanging receiver.

 YOUNG GUY                          Hey!  Hey, you can't... 

	       He reaches for Anderson, then thinks better of it.  Anderson 
	       is twice his size and very menacing in dark glasses.

 YOUNG GUY (CONT'D)                          I'm gettin' a cop.

               The guy scurries off.  Anderson dials quickly.

 INTERCUT ANDERSON/LISAS OFFICE 
               Lisa, walking down a hallway in the Judicial Center, stops
               to answer her BEEPING cell phone.  She leans against a wall,
               as lawyers and judges pass by.

 ANDERSON                          It's me.

 LISA                          Paul.

               Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall

 ANDERSON                          Your phone will be bugged.  So we
                         can't meet, we can't do anything.
                         Just listen.  Nowing you're listening
                         is enough.

               Lisa nods, as if he's right there.  He is right there, for
               her.  This is all she's got.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When Precrime stormed the house, I
                         thought you'd called them.  Betrayed
                         me.

 LISA                          No.

 ANDERSON                          I know.  Witwer sent them.  He saw
                         the disc and had to do his job.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me you forgive me.  Please.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68. 

 LISA                          Of course, I forgive you.

               There's no time left.  He has to get off the line and start
               moving again.  A vast weariness enters his voice.

 ANDERSON                          All these people I need to forgive
                         me.
                              (beat)
                         Do you think Frank forgave me?  All
                         I could do for him was send him
                         gardenias.
                              (long beat)
                         I love you.

               Lisa almost cries out when he hangs up.  She flattens herself
               against a wall.  She stays like that for a long moment,
               pulling the sound of her husband's voice, his words, deep
               inside of herself.

               And then she gets a look, as one of those words registers
               profoundly.

 LISA                               (whispers to herself)
                         Frank hated gardenias.

 EXT. EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER 
               A public cemetery along the Potomac.  There's not much land
               left for new graves.  A funeral is taking place.  A lot of
               mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses.  The service is
               nearing its end.

               Frank D'Ignazio's newly dug grave is nearby.  Lisa stands
               there, looking at the temporary marker, and the flowers and
               wreaths piled up against it.

               Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground.

               High in the sky, a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT, everpresent in Lisa's
               life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE.

               Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers.
               Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH.  There is a
               small envelope tucked beneath a blossom.  She takes it.

               Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car.

               The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing
               dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars.

               One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa.  She looks up and he
               tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over
               them at her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 69. 

               It's Anderson.  Isn't it?  She looks into his eyes.  And
               it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now.
               But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for
               him.  Knows she can't.

               He's already moving on.  He's risked everything for a look.
               He slips into the black sea of mourners, she goes to her car
               -neither of them ever breaking stride.

               The Precrime craft hovers, unaware

 INT. LISA'S CAR 
               Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the
               Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay.

               A Precog DISC falls into her hand.  Her mouth opens -- she's
               never held one before.

               And there is a NOTE with it It READS:

               "The Precogs generated duplicate discs.  This is the first.
               Precrime has the second.  Duplicates.  Why?"

 EXT. A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run.  He
               gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to
               drink.

               He waits in line.  He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting.
               The woman ahead of him argues about change.  He presses his
               lips together.

               And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera
               DOME attached to the ceiling.  It gives him a fish eye
               reflected VIEW of what's happening behind him.

               Precrime police are happening behind him.  He doesn't stop
               to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store.

               Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the
               clerk to the floor.

 INT. BACK ROOM 
               Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can.  He hears the
               mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling
               from the store.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson crashes out into an alley, and clambers up a fence.
               SONIC BLASTS shatter the air around him.  Chunks of brick
               fly off the walls on both sides.  But he is full of
               adrenaline, and there is no stopping him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 70. 

 INT. A TURBOTRAM - THE SPRAWL -- LATER 
               A different part of the city.  Anderson hunkers low in the
               back seat of a tram.

               He looks up, as the DRIVER swears

 DRIVER                          What the hell --

               Anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the
               windshield.  Precrime transports are heading straight at the
               tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue.

               They've even taken radio control of the P.A. system on the
               tram.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson can't believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing
               him?  The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare
               at him, terrified.

               Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit
               doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.

               He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into
               his bag for a glove.  He pulls the weapon onto his right
               hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.

               Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the
               street.  He looks up.  He is surrounded by skyscrapers and
               buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban
               canyon.

               People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into
               doorways where they can.  Passengers in trans and taxis or
               cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching.

               Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in.
               The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically
               altered VOICE.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Lower your weapon, or we will
                         neutralize your threat potential.

               The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing
               at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men.

               Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building
               closest to him.

 ANDERSON'S POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT 
               The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71. 

               Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward
               it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Do not move!

               Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the
               building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.

               He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing.
               It is a moment for prayer.  Anderson doesn't have a moment.

               He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at
               the sidewalk.  The effect on the underground water main is
               immediate.

               A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up
               from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen
               feet into the air right alongside the building.

               The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's
               bouncing at the top of the geyser.  And they can't fire,
               anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement
               from every window in the building.

               All this in a time span of seconds.  The world spins crazily
               for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support
               beam holding the building's sign, one story up.

               The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of
               water from the water main break obscures his moves.

               He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along
               it toward a second story window.  The office building gawkers
               lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to
               sparkling dust and leaps inside.

 INT. OFFICE BUILDING 
               The building covers almost an entire city block.  Anderson,
               dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting
               through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.

               He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,
               jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever
               he must to get to his goal.

               And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the
               avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime
               ambushed him.

               He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream
               of traffic.  It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.

               Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of
               the bus.  It is a bone-jarring landing.  He loses
               consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,
               and slides off it onto the pavement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72. 

               He lies there, trying to rouse himself.  Traffic brakes to a
               stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in
               the road.  No one wants to touch him.  A single car horn
               SOUNDS, and then a chorus of them.

               Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a
               limping run.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION LATER 
               Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at
               the far end of the passenger platform.  There are tracks on
               either side of him, one marked "Uptown" and the other
               "Downtown. "

               He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that
               the Downtown train is coming in.  And on his left, too, the
               Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view.

               Which MagLev train will lead him to safety?  Which one won't
               they pinpoint?  He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm
               around his girlfriend.  They step back, startled.  He's got
               a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle
               shoes.

               The trains pull in.

 ANDERSON                          Pick one for me!

 KID                          What?

 THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY 
 ANDERSON                          Point to the train I should take.
                         Please.

 KID                          I don't know.

               The girl lifts a nervous finger and points.  The Uptown.  He
               runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to
               the Downtown.

 INT. SUBWAY CAR 
               He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the
               dark rush by.  A train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible
               they could find him.

               A station Stop.  He starts to get off, is actually on the
               platform, then steps back onto the train.

               The rushing dark again.  When the MagLev eases to a halt at
               the next station he gets off this time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73. 

 INT. STATION 
               He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people.
               He eases back and lets them go up first.

 THE STAIRS 
               Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching
               people out of the way as they come into view.  They wait
               -but Anderson does not come.  And he does not come.

               On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.

 DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS 
               ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling,
               adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE OFFICERS 
               as they run below him down the stairs.  They go out of sight,
               he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for
               him.

               The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him.  He reaches
               up.  With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve,
               releasing himself from the glob.  He drops to the stairs,
               and instantly slips up them.

               He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend.  He
               slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds
               the laser knife against his throat.

               The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified.  He speaks hoarsely through
               Anderson's choking grip.

 OFFICER                          Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please.

               Anderson looks at the panicked officer.  Anderson closes his
               eyes trying to put it together.  He opens them.

 ANDERSON                          But the Precogs would've predicted
                         me killing you.  You'd know whether
                         I do or not.

               The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy.
               Anderson suddenly gets it.  He tightens his grip on the man.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          They shut down the system.  Haven't
                         they?  They've shut down the Precogs.

               The officer nods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 74. 

 OFFICER                          They're off homicides.  They're
                         redirecting them to help us locate
                         you.

               Which is how they knew where he'd be every time.

               Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull,
               knocking him out.  And then he runs, because what else can
               he do?

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled:
               COURTROOM 17.  She holds a briefcase in one hand.  Down the
               hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one.  She
               enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17.

 INT. COURTROOM 17 
               Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom.  The
               lights are dim.

               She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase.
               She turns it on.

 TV 
               The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and
               over in a continuous loop.  Flashing at the bottom is the
               hotline number: "1-800-PRECRIME." Then- "Call Now!  Call
               Now!

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the
               first disc.

               She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench.

               The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side.  The tv
               plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the
               judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.

               She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from
               one version to the other.  They seem absolutely identical.
               When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.

               Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend,
               endlessly.

 EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY 
               A gas station right out of the fifties.  An attendant in a
               uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield
               of a sky blue Rambler.

               In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75. 

 INT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               Anderson looks at himself in the mirror.  He reaches out and
               touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown.  It is
               still startling to him, the color of his eyes.

               Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air
               syringe Doc gave to him.  He looks at it nervously.  It is
               filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid.

               He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin.
               He closes his eyes.  Then he screws up his courage, and hits
               the plunger.  The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a
               searing HISS.

               Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall
               of the bathroom.  His hands reach up for his face -- which
               looks like it's boiling from within.

 ANDERSON'S FACE 
               The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker.  The muscle tone
               around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old
               man's.  That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years.
               His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop.  Healthy
               pink is replaced by bloodless gray.

 AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT 
 EXT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door

 ATTENDANT                          You all right in there?

               When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a
               fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom.
               Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches
               after him uncertainly as he wanders off.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around
               the headquarters.  There may be a massive campaign to find
               Anderson, but the Precrime public relations machine continues
               to run without interruption.

               There are ten people in the group, and the physically
               transformed Anderson is among them.  They all wear glowing
               nametags.  Anderson's reads, "Mr. Symington." He keeps his
               hands in his pockets, and his head low.

               We have heard the tour guide's spiel before

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 76. 

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               She is about to go on when she looks over at Anderson.  He
               is fidgeting uncomfortably.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Are you ... all right, Mr. Symington?

               Anderson moves up close to her, a little too close.  He
               whispers to her, embarrassed.  She gives him a professional
               smile, and points in the distance past the elevators.

               Anderson nods, and heads off.  She calls after him.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          We'll wait right here for you, sir!

 INT. A STAIRWELL 
	       Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor.

 INT. A BASEMENT CORRIDOR 
               Anderson stands outside a door marked: "Housekeeping." Above
               the doorway is an IdentiScan device.

               Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small
               cryo-jar.

 CLOSE ON: THE CRYO-JAR 
               Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs
               -the irises a luminous blue.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND -- MOMENTS LATER 
               The operations room in Precrime.  The technicians sit at
               their computers and holographic tracking displays.

               Witwer paces among them.  His eyes keep flicking to the
               digital clock on the wall.  Then they cut back to the men
               and machines that are telling him nothing.  Witwer does not
               look well at all, When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his
               computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get
               to him.  He looks over the man's shoulder.

 WITWER                          What is it?

 TECHNICIAN                          Must be a glitch ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77. 

 WITWER                          What?

 TECHNICIAN                          Anderson just got IdentiScanned.

               Witwer grips the back of the technician's chair.  The
               technician types the data through again.

 TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)                          It's him -- he's been scanned.

 WITWER                          Where is he?

               The technician looks up at Witwer.

 TECHNICIAN                          But he's had his eyes done.  Right?
                         Sir?  Tries to think it through.

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         He had to have.

               The technician's computer flashes the next piece of
               information.  When he speaks, it's the last thing Witwer
               wants to hear.

 TECHNICIAN                          Jesus Christ, sir.  He's in the
                         basement of this building.

               All eyes turn to Witwer.  The unspoken question hangs in the
               air.  Anderson's come to murder Witwer?

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Throughout the building, every available Precrime Officer
               begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Four officers stand guard in the chamber.  They listen to
               the orders coming in on their earpieces.  Three of the guards
               rush out of the room, one stays behind.

               The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the female
               in the middle, the males on either side of her.  Their eyes
               are open ... and they are deeply alert.

               Two technicians tend to the Precogs.  At the back of the
               chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sitting
               at the huge mainframe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78. 

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               A ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around
               Witwer.  Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all.

 WITWER                          This is ridiculous.

               Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Standing orders from the Security
                         Panel, sir.

 WITWER                          If he wants to get to me, he'll get
                         to me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          No, he won't, sir.

               Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly.
               Then his eyes flick to the wall clock.

 INT. THE BASEMENT 
               Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors, conducting
               defensive searches of one room after another.  All they are
               coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three
               Precogs.  And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as
               the power is cut.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite
               flashlights.  The Search and Command room suddenly looks
               exceedingly vulnerable.

               A technician calls out from the darkness

 TECHNICIAN                          Don't worry, air -emergency generators
                         will kick on in five seconds.

               The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room
               seem alive with fireflies.  Five seconds go by.  Then ten
               more.

 WITWER                          Explanation, please!

 TECHNICIAN                          Uh, sir.  It seems ... he got the
                         generators, too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79. 

               There is a long moment of silence.  And then Witwer begins
               to laugh.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The room is utterly dark and silent.  The silence is broken
               by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor.  Somebody
               speaks, probably the guard.

 VOICE                          Shit.

               An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.
               And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporarily
               blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.
               Anderson stun guns them quickly.

               The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.
               We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features
               are returning to normal.

               He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is the
               equipment he is after.

               Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in
               horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the
               Precog helmets to the mainframe.

               Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing
               it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches into
               the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of
               blasts.

               Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a
               PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement is
               so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.

               A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes
               hold of his hand.

               Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him,
               is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her to
               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in
               their chairs.

               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair
               is silver white.  And when she speaks, her voice is like the
               wind whispering through time.

 FEMALE                          Save us, Anderson.

               Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully
               planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.

 ANDERSON                          I have to get out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80. 

               She grips his hand.

 FEMALE                          Save us.

               It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading.
               And her eyes, she won't let him go.  She is beginning to
               weaken, to sway on her feet.

               A sudden realization floods over Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          You let me get here, didn't you?
                         You stopped giving them information,
                         so they couldn't track me.

               The Precog female is fading fast.  She tries to reach out
               for him and her legs give way.

 FEMALE                          Save -- 
  	       And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls?  
	       What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the 
	       fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.

 INT. TUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen
               for over an hour.  The two versions of Anderson murdering
               Witwer play over and over.

 LISA                               (wearily, to herself)
                         Help me, Paul.

               She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment
               during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's FACE
               fills the screen.

               Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes.

               And it is his EYES, finally, that tell her everything.  Lisa's
               hand rises to her open mouth.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          They're blue.

               She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at
               the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800
               number scrolling along the bottom.

               When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen,
               she leans close to it and squints.

               Anderson stares right back at her.  And for the first time,
               Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical.  His
               eyes...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          And now they're brown.

               For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile.

 INT. PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters.  Witwer
               walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber.  EMT teams
               work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson
               has left in his wake.

               Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the
               brothers.  Their eyes are closed and they are limp.  Their
               lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other.

               Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is
               almost to himself.

 WITWER                          Why didn't the Precogs know he was
                         coming to do this?

               The Lieutenant has no reply.  Witwer runs both hands through
               his hair.  It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the
               clock ...

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The next time he shows up it'll be
                         to kill me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We won't let that happen, sir.

               Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the
               Lieutenant a withering look.

 WITWER                          You won't, huh?

               When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away
               and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs.  He
               stares at the Precogs.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (to a technician)
                         When can we get these things
                         operational?

 TECHNICIAN                          They're a hive mind, sir.  It takes
                         three for their predictive abilities
                         to be fully operational.

               Which Witwer does not want to hear.  Witwer leans very close
               to the technician.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. 

 WITWER                          These two are all I have to find the
                         man who is about to murder me.  Hook
                         them up, and flood them with whatever
                         kind of fucking chemicals you have
                         to.  They are a machine, and I need
                         that machine at my disposal.

               The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin
               their silent movements again.

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page is a man unglued.  He sits on a tidy little sofa,
               in a tidy 1950's style living room.  But his movements have
               become untidy.  He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue.

               When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his
               chin onto his shirt.  Not like Ennis, at all.

               When his doorbell RINGS, he slowly looks up, then looks down
               at the floor again.  He doesn't answer it.  It RINGS some
               more.

               And then Lisa is standing there before him

 LISA                          Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.  I
                         could just walk in here.

 PAGE                          I forgot.  To turn it on.

               She sits down beside him.

 LISA                          You don't look surprised to see me.

               She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside
               him, three gone.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          I need your help.

               Unexpectedly, tears well up in Ennis's eyes.

 PAGE                          He took one of my babies.

 LISA                          He's desperate, Ennis.  He had to.
                              (beat)
                         We have to help him.

               Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes.  He closes
               them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          It's a fake Ennis.

               Ennis's eyes open again.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This is the first disc.  You delivered
                         it to Director Anderson.  He reviewed
                         it.  And then he stole it, and went
                         on the run.

               Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze.  His words
               slur.

 PAGE                          I delivered ... a fake .. to him?

 LISA                          But he thought it was real, and ran
                         with it.

               The pills, his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing
               it.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          An hour later, you delivered a second
                         disc of the same event.  Witwer
                         reviewed it.  It was real.  (Beat)
                         How do I know this?

               Ennis just wants her to go away.  He wants it all to go away.
               Tears stream down his face.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Director Anderson had his eyes
                         changed.  They were blue.  Now he
                         has brown ones.

               Ennis is sliding away.  Lisa takes hold of him.  Makes him
               listen, dammit.  She points to the disc in her hand.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This disc, the fake one, shows a
                         blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer
                         two days from now.  He doesn't have
                         blue eyes anymore.  The person who
                         faked this disc had no idea he would
                         change his eyes.

               Lisa shakes him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Listen!  But the second disc has to
                         be real, because he has brown eyes
                         when he murders Witwer.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 84. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Somebody tried to frame him with a
                         fake.  And somehow it all became real.
                         Why, Ennis?  How could this happen?

               Ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of
               comprehension.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You handle the discs.  How did a
                         fake one get delivered?

               Ennis's eyes roll back into his head.

               PAGE Coffee ...

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You want-- ?

 PAGE                          He spilled coffee everywhere ...
                         Everywhere ...

 LISA                          What coffee?  What are you -- ?

               But Ennis sags unconscious.  She shakes him hard, even slaps
               him, but Ennis is out.  She lets him drop down on the sofa.

               From outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes
               the WHINE of a hovercraft.

               Lisa looks once more at Ennis, then gets out of there

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               A small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance.  Which
               is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a Precog.

               The female Precog lies on a cot.  Anderson sits on a metal
               folding chair watching her.

               Her eyes slowly open and look at him

 FEMALE                          My brothers aren't here.

 ANDERSON                          You didn't even look around.  You
                         knew.

 FEMALE                               (beat)
                         We can sense each other.  You must
                         save

	       Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85. 

 ANDERSON                          Stop.  I saved You.  It was the best
                         I could do.

               She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall.
               There is a fading pink cabbage rose.  She traces the outline
               of it with her thin finger.

               She turns back to him.

 FEMALE                          Thank you, Anderson.

               It is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a Precog.

 ANDERSON                          What am I going to do with you?

               Her eyes grow very serious.

 FEMALE                          Name me, Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          What?

 FEMALE                          Give me a name.  I've never had one.

               Anderson rises, moves around the small room.  He is shamed,
               embarrassed.

 ANDERSON                          Listen.

               She turns to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Listen to me.
                              (beat)
                         Listen to me ... Rose.

               It is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when
               she faces him again.

 FEMALE                          Rose.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  They shifted your precognition
                         so you would locate me.

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         Yes.  And it hurt us, physically.
                         Did you know that?  The helmets, the
                         controls.  It hurts.

 ANDERSON                               (guiltily)
                         I didn't know.

               For a long moment he can't say anything.  But there are things
               he needs to understand ...

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When they shifted you to find me,
                         you didn't reveal everything.  That
                         I was going to break into Precrime.

 ROSE                          We saw our chance.  You would need
                         to shut us down, you would have to
                         come.  We wanted you to come.

 ANDERSON                          You used me -- to save you.

 ROSE                          I have been used all my life,
                         Anderson.

               Anderson can't meet her eyes.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          No one cared that we were human.
                         From a human mother.  Taken at birth.
                         Hooked to machines.
                              (beat)
                         We have been alive, Anderson.
                         Enslaved, for the greater good.

               Her words are unbearable, for both of them.  She traces the
               outline of the wallpaper rose again.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          But now I have a name.  And I know
                         the man who has named - me will not
                         allow me to be enslaved again.

               Anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully
               watches the street below.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What's going to happen to us?
                         Can you see that?

 ROSE                          I'm weak.  And away from my brothers.
                         I see glimpses and hints of things
                         nearby.  But it's all ... scattered.
                              (beat)
                         I'm tired of the future, Anderson.

               She lies on the bed, watching as Anderson comes back to her.
               He sits carefully on the side of her bed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87. 

               Then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek

 ANDERSON                          You didn't know I was going to do
                         that, did you?

               She is almost too overwhelmed to speak

 ROSE                          No.  Oh, Anderson.  It was lovely.

               And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE DAWN 
               If he were not already dead, it would've killed Ennis Page
               to see the state of his living room.  Precrime officers
               everywhere.  Blood on the rug.  A gun beside the sofa.

               Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner
               crab walk Page's body.  It WHIRS and CLICKS as it probes and
               takes samples from various sites.

               The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab
               makes its determinations.

               Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Who else could it've been?

               The crab probes the ragged hole in Page's head

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
                         an undetected murder.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         Page worshipped the system.  He fell
                         apart.  Shot himself.

               The Lieutenant rolls his eyes.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Anderson.

               Witwer doesn't say anything.  He just stares at the body The
               crab finishes.  The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and
               turns his head to Witwer.  He is only a computer interface,
               but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his
               digitalized voice.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Director Witwer.  This event is a
                         positive homicide.

                         A mortal wound was generated by a

                         left occipital portion of the anterior
                         skull, on June 16th, 2040, at 1:24
                         am, Eastern Standard Time.  A Phase
                         Two Investigation is in order.

               No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes
               and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself
               back in its box.

               At last, someone moves.  It is Witwer.  He lifts his arm,
               pulls back his shirtsleeve, and stares long and hard at his
               watch.

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- DAY LATER 
               Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play
               the two versions of Anderson's murder of Witwer.  Lisa points.

 LISA                          There.

               She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on
               the two monitors.

 CLOSE ON - THE MONITORS 
               On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes, on the right he
               has brown.

 LISA                          The one on the left, the first disc
                         -it's a fake.  He doesn't have blue
                         eyes anymore.

               Witwer stares for a long time.

 WITWER                          A fake.

 (BEAT)                          But the Precogs predict the infallible
                         truth.  They don't emit fake discs.

               And now Lisa smiles.  She has set her lawyerly mind to the
               solution.  It is her moment

 . 
 LISA                          Exactly.  You can't tamper with the
                         Precogs, induce them to make fakes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 89. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         But that doesn't mean someone couldn't
                         have made a fake disc on their own
                         and inserted it into the delivery
                         system.

               The simplicity of it is inconceivable.  Witwer speaks
               carefully, trying to process it

 WITWER                          Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
                         disc in with that day's real ones...

 LISA                               (excited)
                         We're all programmed to believe
                         anything we see on a Precog disc.
                         The system has never been wrong ...

               Witwer stares at the proof before him.  -- the different
               colored eyes of Anderson.  He ejects both discs and holds
               them in his hands.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You have to call off the hunt.  He
                         was set up.

               Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding

 WITWER                               (long beat)
                         It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes
                         her head, shocked at his response

 LISA                          He was set up!  You both were.  If
                         Paul kills you, you're both out of
                         the picture.

 WITWER                          Who wants us out?  Of what picture?

 LISA                          Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing!  And
                         then we can investigate Witwer's
                         mouth opens and closes.  He tries
                         again.

 WITWER                          Ennis Page was murdered last night.

               The blood drains from Lisa's face

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Everything points to Paul.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. 

 LISA                          He's not a murderer.

 WITWER                          I think he is.  A murderer ... and a
                         future murderer.
                              (beat)
                         Lisa.  What does it matter that the
                         first disc is a fake ... if the second
                         one's real?

               Witwer's hands close tight on the discs.  Lisa stands there,
               motionless.  Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly.
               He watches her go.

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Rose sits in a chair near the window.  She is chewing lightly
               on a cracker.  Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's
               texture and taste.  She holds it up and admires its shape.

               Anderson's mood is less wondrous

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to
                         leave you here.  I have to keep
                         moving.

 ROSE'S SMILE ABRUPTLY VANISHES 
 ROSE                          No.  You must save my brothers.

 ANDERSON                          It's impossible.  There's no time.
                         I've done what I can do!

               Rose waits for him to finish.  She looks out the window at
               the street scene.

 ROSE                          Come here, Anderson.

	       He does, reluctantly.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Do you see that boy in the blue hat
                         walking with his mother?
                              (beat)
                         In sixty seconds he will walk beneath
                         those workers installing a window on
                         the tenth floor of that building.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS 
               Two men struggle to lift a large window in place.  Way below
               the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk
               holding his mother's hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. 

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          They'll drop the window, killing
                         him.  It is impossible to save him.

               Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door,
               hurls it open, and disappears down the hall.

               Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs

 EXT. THE STREET. 
               Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the WORKERS
               have lost their grip on the window.

               The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly
               toward disaster.  They do not appear to hear the MEN'S cries.

               The WINDOW falls end over end above the boy's head.  The
               sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it
               looks like a star falling from the sky.

               A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening, and cries
               out.

               But what Anderson does is run.  He runs faster and harder
               than humanly possible.  He does not care if he is recognized
               or hit by a passing taxi.  He is going to get to that boy.
               He has to get to that boy ...

               ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the
               window frame kisses the boy's blue hat.  He knocks the boy
               to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk.

               The mother does not even have time to scream.  She is on the
               ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy.

               He rolls away, and gets to his feet.  Before anyone can put
               together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley,
               and is gone.

 INT. THE ROOM - LATER 
               Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small
               cuts on his face and hands.  He stands across the room staring
               at Rose.

               Rose considers him.  When she speaks her voice is near and
               distant at the same time.  For Anderson, it is as if the
               words are coming from a place inside his own head.

 ROSE                          It was impossible to save that boy
                         -- but you did, Anderson.  It's in
                         you.  It's what you are.

               Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a
               wall.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92. 

 ANDERSON                          You knew it wasn't impossible.  That
                         I'd get there.

               Rose reveals nothing.

 ROSE                          You are a man who saves others.
                              (beat)
                         Save my brothers.

               Anderson almost laughs.  Her persistence is unbelievable

 ANDERSON                          I'm in a lot of trouble right now.

 ROSE                          My brothers are in more trouble.
                         They've moved them to ... an awful
                         place.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most
                         trouble of all.  Who saves him?

               Rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her
               head.  She curls into a fetal position.

               Anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder.  Her eyes
               roll into the back of her head.

               Whose pain is she feeling?  Her own?  Someone else's?
               Anderson doesn't want to think about it.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB -CHEVY CHASE, MD -- NIGHT 
               Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the two
               Precog brothers have been brought here.

               The room is makeshift, uncomfortable ... a place for
               experiments.  The brothers are strapped into chairs.  They
               are helmeted.

               But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in
               their jugular veins.  Connected to the needles are long twists
               of IV tubing.  There are several IVs running at high drip
               rates.

               Witwer has his back to all this.  He stands with Dr. Resfield,
               watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge
               mainframe.

               Dr. Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back at
               the Precogs, uneasy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're not really set up for this
                         type of 

               He stops talking when he looks into Witwer's hollow eyes. Witwer 
               is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- MORNING 
               Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water.  Her skin is
               translucent, unhealthy, glistening with sweat.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Try to drink.

               She pushes the cup away.  She closes her eyes, as if even
               the dim light of the room causes her pain.

 ROSE                          Your wife.  We have to get her here,
                         Anderson.

               She opens her eyes.  Anderson doesn't like the feel of this.

 ANDERSON                          Why?

 ROSE                          I don't know ...

 ANDERSON                          What are you seeing?

 ROSE                          Glimpses, Anderson.  Please.  We
                         have to get her here.

 ANDERSON                          You're scaring me, Rose

               She covers his mouth with her hand

 ROSE                          Stop talking.  It uses me up.

               For a long time, Rose says nothing, Her gaze is locked onto
               a distance beyond the room.  At last, she speaks.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          In three minutes your wife will take
                         a walk ..

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               Lisa sits in her office.  But she can't stand it, the sitting
               and waiting.  She has to move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 94. 

               She gets up and hurriedly leaves her office

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Witwer walks past Lisa's SECRETARY toward the open door of
               Lisa's office.

 SECRETARY                          Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for
                         a few minutes.
                              (beat)
                         Sir?

               Witwer stares into the empty office.  There is a clock on
               Lisa's desk.  His eyes fix on it.

 EXT. JUDICIAL CENTER ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble
               building.  She takes a deep breath, then heads down Jefferson
               Boulevard toward the city.

               A sleek black TRANSPORT with two Precrime officers in it
               follows her from a discreet distance.

               In the sky above, the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft

 INT. CITY STREET ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa walks down the street.  She hugs herself, barely aware
               of her surroundings.  She passes by stores, restaurants,
               payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious.  People push past
               her.

               On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone
               beside her begins to RING.  If she hears it, she gives no
               indication.  A KID reaches for it, listens, hangs up.

               She walks on.  Stores.  Restaurants.  An art gallery.  As
               she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE, it suddenly starts to
               ring.  This time Lisa glances at it.  But again, walks on.

               The TRANSPORT weaves through traffic, nearby She walks past
               the K.L. Lawrence Graphics Museum.  And another restaurant.
               And a PAYPHONE.  And this time, finally, when it, too, RINGS,
               she turns and looks hard at it.

               A man begins to walk over to it.  Lisa almost knocks him out
               of the way to get to it.  She grabs at the receiver.

 LISA                          Hello?  Hello?

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I need you.

               Lisa's forehead sags against the side of the payphone.  She
               basks in the sound of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95. 

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          It's 1:03.  Set your watch, exactly.

               Lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens
               LISA Okay.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          This is what you have to do ...

               We now hear ANDERSON continue in VOICE OVER as we follow
               Lisa through a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ...

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa walks up the steps of the museum

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter
                         the Lawrence Museum.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               Lisa walks quickly through a display of 19th century magazine
               advertising.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               The two Precrime officers walk into a room filled with Chinese
               graphics.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:13 the two Precrime officers
                         following you take a wrong turn into
                         a different room, losing sight of
                         you for ten seconds.

               The officers start toward the entrance way to another room,
               then hesitate uncertainly, and go for another entrance way.

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa hurries down the steps

 INT. A SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa boards the "A" MagLev train

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          An undercover transport officer will
                         have received emergency orders to
                         follow you.
 (MORE)                          He's wearing a red tie.  He has short
                         blond hair.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96. 

 INT. THE SUBWAY CAR 
               The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far
               end of Lisa's car, watching her.

               At the next stop Lisa gets off.  He follows, not too far
               behind.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa starts up the stairs.  She looks at her watch, then
               makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's
               time frame.  She starts up again.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          As you come around the bend, cry out
                         and turn around and slap the
                         officer...

               Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised. At the
               same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into
               view, and see this happening.  Lisa starts to run.  When the
               undercover officer tries to stop her, the two men grab the
               officer, and they get into a fight.

               Lisa escapes.

 INT. A TAXI - THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa looks at her watch, then taps the window for the driver
               to stop.  She gets out.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          Stay on Ninth street.  Underneath
                         Ninth street is the main power feed
                         for The Sprawl.  It'll mess up the
                         navigational beacon on the hovercraft.
                              (beat)
                         Keep switching taxis.  But stay on
                         Ninth.

               She hails another taxi.  She holds her hand over the
               IdentiScan before it can read her.  The taxi driver looks at
               her, sees her smile, sees the prepaid cash card she holds
               out to him.

 LISA                          Two hundred dollars if you don't
                         scan me.

               It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened.  He grabs
               the card, and jerks his head for her to get in.  They take
               off.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97. 

 EXT. NINTH STREET LATER 
               Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky.
               It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets,
               dirigibles.  Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft.

               And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          The hovercraft will try to drop
                         altitude, but the air traffic will
                         slow it down.
                              (beat)
                         Precrime loses you.  You'll have to
                         walk two miles.  Don't get scanned.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street.  She stands out in
               her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of
               black.

               Too vulnerable to pass up.  A MAN in a gray overcoat slides
               out from between two buildings in front of her.  He is not
               coy about his intent.  He comes straight at her, all business.

               Lisa freezes in place.  She looks at her watch.  The man
               grabs her by the shoulder.  When she starts to scream, he
               claps his hand over her mouth, hard.

 MAN                          You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your
                         teeth out.

               Her eyes look around frantically.  He starts to drag her
               backwards into the dark.

               ANDERSON leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a
               light post.  It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens
               his grip on Lisa.  His legs at last collapse under him.

               Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground.  She hugs him hard.

               Then pulls back from him.  She gives him a look.

 LISA                          Cut it a little close there,
                         honeybunch.

 ANDERSON                          Rose got the street wrong.  She's
                         getting weak.

 LISA                          Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER 
               Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson
               together.

               Lisa needs to touch him.  She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes
               back a loose look of his hair.  Rose is mesmerized by her
               actions.  She drinks in everything, every bit of life.

               Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation.  They speak to
               each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room.

               Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.

 ANDERSON                          Two discs.  One fake.  One real.

 LISA                          I don't think there were supposed to
                         be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't
                         counting on two.

               They are silent for a long time.  Rose watches them work it
               through.

 ANDERSON                          An infallible system.  Every disc
                         ever generated has been true ...

 LISA                          Somebody wants you out of the way --
                         so they make a fake disc.  Who ever
                         doubts the discs?

 ANDERSON                          I never doubted it.  I saw it.  And
                         believed it, absolutely.  I was
                         certain I was going to murder Witwer.

               Anderson is shaking.  Lisa wraps her arms around him.  His
               voice is a stunned whisper.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the fake, and believed so much
                         in the system, that I saw myself as
                         a murderer.
                              (beats)
                         And the Precogs picked up those
                         thoughts ...

 LISA                          And generated the second disc.  The
                         real one.

 ANDERSON                          A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I
                         believed it was true.  And that made
                         it true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. 

               Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose.  She lies curled on
               the bed, her face to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Rose.  If all this is based on a lie
                         -the fake disc -- then do I really
                         kill Witwer?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We see what we see.  I'm sorry,
                         Anderson.  It's been predicted.

               Such a small voice, delivering a message of such finality

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- MIDNIGHT 
               Lieutenant Glaser tries to get through to Witwer.  Witwer's
               back is turned to him.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We can't take chances, sir

               Witwer doesn't move or answer.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          It happens in less than three hours.
                              (beat)
                         We put you in a hovercraft and keep
                         you airborne -- until after the event.

 WITWER                          The event.

               Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I've been ordered to get you onto
                         the craft.  By force if necessary.

 WITWER                          The event is inevitable, Lieutenant.

	        Witwer doesn't turn around.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The Precogs are never wrong.  The
                         event will take place.  I'm a
                         believer.  Aren't you?

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I don't leave this room without you,
                         sir.  The Security Panel insists.

 CUT TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 100. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE SIMULTANEOUS 
               Anderson and Lisa keep working it, peeling away the layers.
               Rose lies silent.

 ANDERSON                          Nobody could slip a fake disc past
                         Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.

 LISA                          He was the weak link in the perfect
                         system.

 ANDERSON                          Obsessive compulsive niners can't
                         allow changes in the routine

 LISA                          Something threw him off.
                              (beat)
                         He tried to tell me.  It didn't make
                         any sense.  Something about "spilled
                         coffee."
                              (beat)
                         Someone was in his office with him.
                         And coffee spilled ...

               We stay CLOSE ON Anderson and Lisa as Rose's voice cuts in.

 ROSE (V.O.)                          We were always treated as if we
                         weren't alive.  As if we weren't
                         there.

               The camera pulls back and they are watching her as she
               continues to speak.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Even now.  You forget that I'm here.
                         You talk between yourselves.  And
                         when you need me to see into the
                         future, then you turn to me.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What is it?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We weren't just lost in the future.
                         We were in the Chamber, too.  Our
                         eyes were open.  In the present.

               And then Anderson gets it.  He kneels beside her bed

 ANDERSON                          Your eyes were open.  What did you
                         see, Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101. 

 ROSE                          Who would I have told?  Who ever
                         talked to us?  Who cared that we
                         could talk?

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Who spilled the coffee?
                         Straight ahead ...

               Rose stares stright ahead ...

 MEMORY HIT 
               Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber.  Her brothers
               sit in their usual places on either side of her.  The
               technicians tend to them.

               Rose's eyes are open.  She sees everything in the room.  The
               technicians, the machines ... and across the room a large
               window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe
               computer.

               Rose watches through the window ...

               As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them

 ROSE (V.O.)                          Ed Witwer entered Page's office.

               Witwer carries a mug of coffee.

               Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee.  Speaks
               to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee.  We can't hear
               the words.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Page was so upset at the sight of
                         the coffee.

               Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table.  It
               tips, and spills.

               Page looks like his head will explode.  He pulls a neatly
               folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops
               to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the
               coffee stain on his spotless rug.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket,
                         reached over Page and put it in one
                         of the open cases.

               Witwer closes the case.  He looks through the window into
               the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose --
               and what does she matter?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102. 

               Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug.  Witwer shrugs in
               apology and leaves the room.  Page stares after him.

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Rose is weeping.  She looks at Anderson and Lisa.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          I didn't understand what I'd seen.
                         And I had no one to tell ...

               Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend
               what he has heard.

 ANDERSON                          Ed ...

               Lisa turns, and speaks softly to her husband.

 LISA                          The perfect system -brought down by
                         a cup of coffee.  My god.

 ANDERSON                               (long beat)
                         He set into motion his own death.
                         He didn't know it would go this far.
                              (to Rose)
                         What makes me leave this room?  If I
                         stay here I won't kill him.  Right?

               But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question
               for him.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE 
               Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch.  Witwer is still in
               his chair, turned away from him.

 WITWER                          You see, if you think you can put me
                         on a hovercraft and save me, then
                         you don't believe in the infallibility
                         of the Precog system.

               Lieutenant Glaser has his orders.  He begins to approach.

               And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts
               the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant
               Glaser in the forehead.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And what I do not want around me,
                         are nonbelievers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103. 

               Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks
               out of the office, locking the door behind him.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD -- LATER 
               Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete
               building that houses the lab.  The lights are out in all the
               windows except the back section of the second floor.  There,
               the lights burn brightly.

               Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it.
               He smiles as if he knows something they don't.  He looks at
               his watch.  It is a cool night, but his face is slick with
               sweat.

               He walks to the entrance of the building.  An OFFICER 1s
               startled to see him.

 WITWER                          Things quiet?

 OFFICER                          Sir.  Should you ... be here?

 WITWER                          There's been a development.  A body's
                         been found in the Sprawl.

 OFFICER                          Anderson's?

 WITWER                          They're checking it out.  I need to
                         see what the Precogs have seen.

               Witwer is IdentiScanned.  The door opens and he goes in.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Dr. Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying
               a tv under his arm.  Witwer is the last person he wants to
               see.

 WITWER                          Borrowed this from the technicians'
                         lounge.  You don't think they'll
                         mind, do you?

 DR.RESFIELD                          You shouldn't be here, Director.

               Dr. Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall,
               the red numbers ticking off time in seconds.

               Witwer looks for a plug, finds one.  Plugs in the tv.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 104. 

 WITWER                          No, no.  This is exactly where I
                         should be.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You're under a lot of strain,
                         Director.

               Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of
               his murder by Anderson.  "Call Now!  Call Now!"

 WITWER                          And tv's so good for that -- soothes
                         the mind.

               Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a
               bright smile.  The scientist looks like he wants to run out
               of the room.

               Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the
               Precogs.  Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting
               IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets.

               The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.
               But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too
               weak for that.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Bring me up to speed, Doc.

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're getting nothing from them.

 WITWER                          And that's because ... ?

               Witwer still grips him by the elbow.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I don't know.

 WITWER                          Do you think they know where Anderson
                         is?

 DR. RESFIELD                          It's impossible to tell.
                              (beat)
                         We've done everything.  Maybe even
                         too much.

 WITWER STARES AT THE PRECOGS 
 WITWER                          They know how to find Anderson for
                         me.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105. 

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         They're the perfect machine, Doctor.
                         You just have to know which button
                         to push.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL 
               Rose looks like she's on fire.  Anderson wets another towel,
               wrings it over the sink.  Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's
               face and arms .

               Rose's lips are moving soundlessly.  Her eyes are shut tight.
               She begins to writhe in bed.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus Christ.

 LISA                          Come on, Rose.

 ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH 
 ANDERSON                          One hour.  We hold it together for
                         an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not
                         a murderer.

 LISA                          She won't last an hour.

               It suddenly looks much worse than that.  Rose's body contorts
               horribly and she arches up off the bed.  Lisa can't control
               her.

               Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to
               hold and comfort her.

 ANDERSON                          Rose!

               She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.

 ROSE                          He's killed him, Anderson!

               Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes
               slack.  Anderson eases her back on the bed.  He stares at
               her, stricken.

               Her voice barely leaves her now

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          You didn't save my brother.

               Anderson reels at her words.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106. 

 ANDERSON                          Did he kill both of them, Rose?
                         Rose!

               Rose manages to speak, one last time.  Her whispered words
               damn him.

 ROSE                          Does it matter, Anderson?

               Anderson rises.  Looks down at Rose.

               It matters.  He starts to move, quickly.

               Lisa takes hold of his arm.

 LISA                          If you leave this room...

	       Anderson kisses her.

 ANDERSON                          Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
                         hisjob.

               He reaches for his duffel bag.

               When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly
               and looks.  And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a
               place deep within her own mind.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER 
               He passes by several cars on the street.  But they're all
               auto-drive, they won't do him any good.

               So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a
               city police transport zooms up, lights flashing.  Two city
               officers leap out of the transport.  They approach the
               smashed-in store window, weapons drawn.  Which is a mistake.
               Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a
               small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on.

               As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with
               BindFoam.

               Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power
               the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof.
               Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets
               of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.

 INT. THE LAB 
               The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time.  Witwer reaches his
               hand up and touches the vanishing numbers.

               The camera pulls back, and we see Dr. Resfield and the two
               technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 107. 

               And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on
               the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers.
               A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of
               his skull.

               The other Precog sits very still in his chair.  He is still
               connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs
               drip into him.  His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves,
               the Precog's eyes follow him.

               Witwer can feel them on him.  He turns around.

 WITWER                          Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?
                              (beat)
                         I think yes.

               The Precog looks at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And you think yes.

               Witwer points to the tv screen, running Anderson's murder of
               Witwer.  Witwer smiles triumphantly.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Infallibly, immutably yes.

               The Precog looks at him.  Witwer's smile vanishes, and
               suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over
               the Precog's eyes.  Then he turns, and stares again at the
               clock.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB 
               Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the
               building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons
               cradled in their arms.

               Behind them is a line of yew bushes.  AS we watch, the officer
               on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes.
               Several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the
               officer on the right.

               The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right.
               Then he looks hard.  He grips his weapon tight, and swings
               left.  No one there, either.

               ANDERSON drops him hard, from behind.  The officer crumples
               onto the cement.

               But Anderson's not done with him.  Anderson lifts him up,
               struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance.

               Anderson holds him upright in place.  The man's head lolls
               backward.  Which is.  Perfect for what Anderson needs to do.
               Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes.
               He pulls up on the eyelids.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 108. 

               An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's
               eyes.  Access granted, the doors HISS open.  Anderson enters
               the building, dragging the officer with him.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Anderson enters the lab.  The very building sickens him.
               What he sees sickens him even more.

               The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair.  Witwer
               sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother
               at his feet.  Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet.  His
               hand is in his lap, holding a gun.

               He grins when Anderson appears.  He takes off the helmet,
               drops it on the floor.

 WITWER                          I figured, since I can see the future,
                         too, maybe I could get a little disc
                         action going.
                              (beat)
                         Just kidding.

               Anderson stares at his old partner.  Then he looks up at the
               digital clock.  Five-seventeen AM.  Witwer looks too, then
               turns back to Anderson.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You find you been doing that a lot
                         this week?  Looking at clocks?
                              (beat)
                         Three minutes to go.

               Anderson turns to the tv.

 ANDERSON                          There's never anything good on, you
                         know?

               Now Witwer smiles.

 WITWER                          There.  That's the old Paul.

 ANDERSON                          You're not the old Ed. You've lost
                         it.

               Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.

 WITWER                          You lost it.  You went weak in the
                         knees, partner.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not your partner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 109. 

               Witwer looks at him sadly.

 WITWER                          The air went out of you when Frank
                         D'Ignazio killed himself.

 ANDERSON                          He was guilty.  I accepted that.

 WITWER                          No you didn't.  The doubts were
                         creeping in on you.  The lab trying
                         to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm
                         pressuring you to expand ...

               Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog
               brother's cheek.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Belief is the basis of the system.
                         It was your job to be the ultimate

               Witwer is breathing hard.  He lifts a hand and wipes the
               sweat from his face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And when Frank died, you faltered.
                         I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of
                         men.
                              (beat)
                         And the thing about you is, you
                         wouldn't have just walked away.

 ANDERSON                          Never been my style.

	      Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile

 WITWER                          Precrime needs to grow.  You would
                         have stood in its way.  The Security
                         Panel wouldn't have understood that.
                         What you're capable of.  What a
                         bulldog you are.

                         Look what you've been doing to us
                         all week.  Amazing.  You're the best.

 ANDERSON                          So you took matters into your own hands.

 WITWER                          I understood the threat.  I understood
 YOU 
               Anderson looks at the dead Precog

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110. 

 ANDERSON                          You killed a Precog.  You ended the
                         system you wanted to protect.

 WITWER                          Wrong.  This lab will make more.
                         Believe it, Paul.

               They look at the CLOCK.  Five-nineteen.

 ANDERSON                          Knowing the exact moment of your
                         death -it's made you crazy, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the tv.  The TV REALITY is almost in synch
               with what is happening in the room.

               Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is
               terribly wrong.

               Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the
               disc -- except there is a major difference.

 WITWER                          You sonofabitch!

               Anderson lifts up both hands

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You didn't bring your gun!

 ANDERSON                          That's right.  No gun.

 WITWER                          You see?!  That's exactly what I'm
                         talking about.  You don't Believe!

               Anderson just looks at Witwer, raging at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The system is infallible.

               ANDERSON Doesn't Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and
               pulls a second gun from out of his belt.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          I guess that's why I've always carried
                         two.

               He tosses the gun to Anderson.  It clatters at Anderson's
               feet.

 ANDERSON                          You can't have it both ways.  You
                         don't want to die.  That's why you
                         lured me here -- to kill me first.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         But it you don't diet the system is
                         flawed, and you couldn't live with
                         that.

               Witwer SHOOTS him once, in the right thigh.  Anderson cries
               out, falls to the concrete floor.

 WITWER                          Pick it up

               Anderson speaks through his teeth ANDERSON It doesn't happen.

               Witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock.

               He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back IV
               feeding into the Precog's main line.  A thick, yellow fluid
               begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You're killing him, partner.

               And what choice, finally, does Anderson have?  He reaches
               for the gun.

 ANDERSON                          Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains
                         his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains
                         his gun on Witwer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Oh, Ed ...

               Witwer lowers his gun.  And stands there between Anderson
               and the doomed Precog.

               The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.

               Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart.  Witwer is thrown
               back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.

               Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV
               out of the main line.  The yellow drips onto the floor,
               mingling with Witwer's red.

               Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him.  Witwer
               whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.

 WITWER                          Now do you believe?

               Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last
               breaths alone.

 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               It is Rose's face.  The camera pulls back and we see that
               she is lying on a grassy hillside.  Her brother is lying
               beside her.

               They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with
               stars.

               Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to
               her brother.

 ROSE                          James.  Can you guess what I'm
                         thinking?

 JAMES                               (beat)
 NO. 
               James smiles.  And then, after a long moment, so does Rose.

          We see three faces in lamplight, looking down. They have
          been through a long vigil and it shows in their tired eyes
          and disarranged clothing. One is a young gentlewoman with
          a sweet girlish face, KATE KELLER; the second is an elderly
          DOCTOR, stethoscope at neck, thermometer in fingers; the
          third is a gruff gentleman in his forties with chin whis-
          kers, CAPTAIN ARTHUR KELLER.

          DOCTOR
          Shet11 live.
          KATE closes her eyes.
          I can tell you now, I thought she
          wouldn't,

          KELLER

          (INDULGENT)
          I've brought up two of them, but
          this is my wife's first, she
          isn't battle-scarred yet.

          KATE
          Doctor. Will my girl be all right?

          0 DOCTOR
          Oh, by morning she'll be knocking
          down Captain Kellerfs fences again.

          KATE
          Is there nothing we should do?

          KELLER

          (JOVIAL)
          Put up stronger fencing, ha?

          DOCTOR
          Just let her get well, she knows
          how to do it better than we do.
          These things come and go in infants,
          never know why. Call it acute
          congestion of the stomach and brain.
          KELL ? moves after the DOCTOR, we hear them off-camera;
          we see only KATE'S face hovering over us, her hand adjust-
          ing the blanket.

          KELLER
          I'll see you to your buggy, Doctor.

          DOCTOR (OFF CAMERA)
          0 Main thing is the fever's gone.
          I've never seen a baby, more
          vitality, that's the truth --
          Their voices and footsteps fade. KATE is bent lovingly
          over the crib, which emits a bleat; her finger is play-
          ful with the baby's face.

          KATE
          Hush. Don't you cry now, you've
          been trouble enough. Call it
          acute congestion, indeed, I don't
          see what's so cute about a con-
          gestion, just because it's yours?
          We'll have your father run an
          editorial in his paper, the wonders
          of modern medicine, they don't know
          what they're curing even when they
          cure it. Men, men and their battle
          scars, we women will have to --
          Helen, Helen Captain, Captain,
          will you come.
          (She screams)

          2. NIGHT. EXT. SIDE OF KELLER HOUSE.

          KELLER standing lamp in hand watching the doctor's buggy
          recede in the night. Suddenly from the house behind him
          comes a knifing scream. KELLER wheels, the scream comes
          again and the CAMERA follows KELLER's run with the lamp
          across the yard.

          3. NIGHT. INT. KELLER HOUSE.

          KELLER runs into the house and up the dark stairs.

          4. NIGHT. INT. HELEN'S NURSERY.

          KELLER bursts into the bedroom where KATE is screaming
          at the crib, her look intent on the baby and terrible.

          KELLER
          Katie, what's wrong?

          KATE
          Look.

          face.

          HELENL
          His face has something like fury in it, crying the child's
          name; KATE almost fainting presses her knuckles to her
          mouth, to stop her own cry.

          FADE OUT

          5. DAY. INT. KELLEL HOUSE - TITLE SHOT.

          The stairs in the Keller House. In the foreground we see
          the bannisters, in the background the wall. A shadow.of
          the erratic, staggering figure of 5 year old HELEN appears
          on the wall, moving slowly. The two Negro children
          scamper past -- their excited laughter coming to us, in
          contrast to the mute HELEN. In CU, in the FG, HELEN'S
          little hands come into the frame, grasping the bannister
          rail.

          maze, the sheets blowing in the wind; and staggering among
          them is the figure of the child, HELEN 5 years old, reach-
          ing out, struggling, buffeted by the damp, blowing sheets,
          CRANE DOWN towards the figure. HELEN lashes out, her
          face frightened, unknowing --- she pulls down a sheet, be-
          comes tangled in its folds, almost hysterical. In the BG
          KATE comes rushing from the house -- to help her.

          7. NIGHT. INT. LIVING ROOM KELLER HOUSE - TITLE SHOT.

          There is a Christmas tree with decorations and in a WIDE
          SHOT we see HELEN, 7 years old, reaching up into tree.
          At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha,
          7 years, looking in. HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball
          and rips it down, shattering at her feet. CRAB IN AND
          AROUND coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS
          hands, another ball, she pulls it down. We see her face,
          blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and
          beyond her the other children watching.

          $. DAY. EXT. AFIELD - TITLE SHOT.

          A WIDE HIGH SHOT. We see the lonely expanse of field with
          0 a low grass sprouting up, in the BG is the Keller house
          perhaps. Going slowly across the field is the figure of
          the child HELEN, Patty Duke. From in under CAMERA comes
          KATE, following her.

          three kneeling children and an old dog around the pump.
          V INEY with jug on way to barn to get milk.
          The dog is a setter named BELLE, and she is sleeping. Two
          of the children are Negroes, MARTHA and PERCY. The third
          child is HELEN, quite unkempt, in body a vivacious little
          person with a fine head, attractive, but noticeably blind,
          one eye larger and protruding; her gestures are abrupt,
          insistent, lacking in human restraint, and her face never

          smiles. She is flanked by the other two, in a litter of
          0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, HELEN'S hands
          thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the
          movements of their lips. The CAMERA is on this; the
          dialogue is only background.

          MARTHA

          You stop that.

          good operation.

          tor left to fix up, time you
          finish all them opera--
          But HELEN is poking her fingers inside his mouth, to feel
          his tongue; he bites at them, annoyed, and she jerks them
          away. HELEN now fingers her own lips, moving them in
          imitation, but soundlessly. Again the CAMERA on this.

          MARTHA
          What you do, bite hand?

          PERCY
          That's how I do, she keep pokint.

          moving in silence, growing more and more frantic,
          until in a bizarre rage she bites at her own fingers.
          This sends PERCY off into laughter, but alarms :MARTHA.

          buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the
          doll as eyes. KELLER stands, caught, and watches
          morosely, AUNT EV blinks and conceals her emotion by

               A SINGLE CIGARETTE. A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a 
               bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of 
               the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. 
               There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND--

               --now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really 
               a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western 
               themed.

               He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous 
               mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered 
               along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows 
               stronger--there could be a storm.

               PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he 
               continues to type.

               He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good 
               face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other 
               words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen 
               years and for half that time, the most recent half, a 
               remarkably successful one.

               He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a 
               hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another 
               burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the 
               table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words:

                                         THE END

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this 
               last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up, 
               folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of 
               pages.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he holds his book to him. He is, just for a brief 
               moment, moved.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SUITCASE across the room. PAUL goes to it, opens it and 
               pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather 
               briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the 
               briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, 
               and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a 
               child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself 
               a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match--
               there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales 
               deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles.

               HOLD BRIEFLY, then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LODGE - DAY

               PAUL--exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws 
               it, hitting a sign.

                                     PAUL
                         Still got it.

               He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and, 
               holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives 
               away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SIGN that reads "Silver Creek Lodge." Behind the sign is 
               the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes 
               out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign. As "Shotgun" 
               by Jr. Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the 
               mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY. Gun-metal grey. The clouds seem pregnant with snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving the Mustang, the battered briefcase on the 
               seat beside him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD AHEAD. Little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly 
               visible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR, going into a curve and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving, and as he comes out of the curve, a stunned 
               look hits his face as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD AHEAD--and here it comes--a mountain storm; it's as 
               if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning 
               whatsoever, we're into a blizzard and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, slowing, driving deeper into the mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, squinting ahead, windshield wipers on now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, rounding another curve, losing traction--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, a skilled driver, bringing the car easily under control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD

               Snow is piling up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL driving confidently, carefully. Now he reaches out, 
               ejects the tape, expertly turns it over, pushes it in and, 
               as the MUSIC continues, he hums along with it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY. Only you can't see it.

               There's nothing to see  but the unending snow, nothing to 
               hear but the wind which keeps getting wilder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD. Inches of snow on the ground now. This is desolate 
               and dangerous.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOW. Worse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD, curving sharply, drop ping. A sign reads: "Curved 
               Road, Next 13 Miles."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, coming into view, hitting the curve--no problem--
               no problem at all--and then suddenly, there is a very serious 
               problem and as the car skids out of control--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, doing his best, fighting the conditions and just as it 
               looks like he's got things going his way--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD, swerving down and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, all traction gone and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, helpless and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, skidding, skidding and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD as it drops more steeply away and the wind whips 
               the snow across and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG starting to spin and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MOUNTAINSIDE as the car skids off the road, careens down, 
               slams into a tree, bounces off, flips, lands upside down, 
               skids, stops finally, dead.

               HOLD ON THE CAR A MOMENT

               There is still the sound of the WIND, and there is still the 
               music coming from the tape, perhaps the only part of the car 
               left undamaged. Nothing moves inside. There is only the WIND 
               and the TAPE. The wind gets louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WRECK looked at from a distance. The MUSIC sounds are 
               only faintly heard.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE AREA WHERE THE WRECK IS--AS SEEN FROM THE ROAD. The car 
               is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WRECK from outside, and we're close to it now, with the 
               snow coming down ever harder--already bits of the car are 
               covered in white.

               CAMERA MOVES IN TO

               PAUL. He's inside and doing his best to fight is, but his 
               consciousness is going. He tries to keep his eyes open but 
               they're slits.

               Slowly, he manages to reach out with his left arm for his 
               briefcase--

               --and he clutches it to his battered body. The MUSIC continues 
               on.

               But PAUL is far from listening. His eyes flutter, flutter 
               again. Now they're starting to close.

               The man is dying.

               Motionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase.

               HOLD ON THE CASE. Then--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The BRIEFCASE in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk.

                         What's that?

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               We are in New York City in the office of Paul's literary 
               agent, MARCIA SINDELL. The walls of the large room are 
               absolutely crammed with book and movie posters, in English 
               and all other kinds of other languages, all of them featuring 
               the character of MISERY CHASTAIN, a perfectly beautiful woman. 
               Misery's Challenge, Misery's Triumph--eight of them. All 
               written by Paul Sheldon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lifting up the battered briefcase--maybe when new it 
               cost two bucks, but he treats it like gold.

                                     PAUL
                         An old friend. I was rummaging through 
                         a closet and it was just sitting 
                         there. Like it was waiting for me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              compliment)
                         It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... 
                         character.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TWO OF THEM

                                     PAUL
                         When I wrote my first book, I used 
                         to carry it around in this while I 
                         was looking for a publisher. That 
                         was a good book, Marcia. I was a 
                         writer then.

                                     SINDELL
                         You're still a writer.

                                     PAUL
                         I haven't been a writer since I got
                         into the Misery business--

                                     SINDELL
                              (holding up the cover 
                              art of MISERY'S CHILD)
                         Not a bad business. This thing would 
                         still be growing, too. The first 
                         printing order on Misery's Child was
                         the most ever--over a million.

                                     PAUL
                         Marcia, please.

                                     SINDELL
                         No, no. Misery Chastain put braces 
                         on your daughter's teeth and is 
                         putting her through college, bought 
                         you two houses and floor seats to 
                         the Knick games and what thanks does 
                         she get? You go and kill her.

                                     PAUL
                         Marcia, you know I started "Misery" 
                         on a lark. Do I look like a guy who 
                         writes romance novels? Do I sound 
                         like Danielle Steel? It was a one-
                         time shot and we got lucky. I never 
                         meant it to become my life. And if I 
                         hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd 
                         have ended up writing her forever.
                              (touches his briefcase)
                         For the first time in fifteen years, 
                         I think I'm really onto something 
                         here.

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really 
                         am. But you have to know--when your 
                         fans find out that you killed off 
                         their favorite heroine, they're not 
                         going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon 
                         can finally write what we've always 
                         wanted: An esoteric, semi-
                         autobiographical character study.

                                     PAUL
                              (passionately)
                         Marcia, why are you doing this to 
                         me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? 
                         Don't you think I remember how nobody 
                         gave a shit about my first books? 
                         You think I'm dying to go back to 
                         shouting in the wilderness?
                              (beat)
                         I'm doing this because I have to.
                              (Marcia is stopped)
                         Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try 
                         to finish this and I want your good 
                         thoughts--because if I can make it 
                         work ...
                              (beat)
                         I might just have something that I 
                         want on my tombstone.

               On the word "tombstone"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S TOMBSTONE--the upside down car with the blizzard coming 
               gale-force and his motionless body trapped inside the car.

               The WIND screams. PAUL'S EYES flutter, then close.

               Hold

               Keep holding as--

               Suddenly there's a new sound as a crowbar SCRATCHES at the 
               door--

               -- nd now the door is ripped open as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A BUNDLED-UP FIGURE gently beginning to pull PAUL and the 
               case from the car. For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a 
               man or woman--

               --not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is, 
               very much, a woman. Her name is ANNIE WILKES and she is close 
               to Paul's age. She is in many ways a remarkable creature. 
               Strong, self-sufficient, passionate in her likes and dislikes, 
               loves and hates.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE as she cradles him in her arms. Once he's 
               clear of the car, she lays him carefully in the snow

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE: CLOSE UP. She slowly brings her mouth down 
               close to his. Then their lips touch as she forces air inside 
               him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Their lips touch 
                              again. Then--)
                         You hear me--Breathe! I said 
                         breathe!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he starts to breathe--

               --in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide, but he's in shock, 
               the eyes see nothing--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE--the moment she sees him come to life, she goes into 
               action, lifting PAUL in a fireman's carry, starting the 
               difficult climb back up the steep hill.

               As she moves away, she and Paul are obliterated by the white 
               falling snow.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WHITE OF WHAT SEEMS LIKE A HOSPITAL. Everything is bled 
               of color. It's all vague--

               --we are looking at this from Paul's blurred vision.

               And throughout this next sequence, there are these SOUNDS, 
               words really, but they make no sense.

               "...no... worry...

               ...be... fine...

               ...good care... you...

               ...I'm your number one fan..."

               The first thing we see during this is something all white. 
               It takes a moment before we realize it's a ceiling.

               Now, a white wall.

               An I.V. bottle is next, the medicine dripping down a tube 
               into PAUL'S LEFT ARM. The other arm is bandaged and in a 
               sling.

               ANNIE is standing beside the bed. She wears off-white and 
               seems very much like a nurse. A good nurse. She has pills in 
               her hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Motionless, dead pale. He has a little beard now. Eyes 
               barely open, he's shaking with fever.

                                     PAUL
                              (hardly able to whisper)
                         ...where... am I...?

               ANNIE is quickly by his side.

                                     ANNIE
                              (so gently)
                         Shhh... we're just outside Silver 
                         Creek.

                                     PAUL
                         How long...?

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been here two days. You're 
                         gonna be okay.
                              (relieved)
                         My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--

                                     PAUL
                         --my number one fan.

               And now the gibberish words make sense.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's right. I'm also a nurse. Here.
                              (Now, as she brings 
                              the pills close)
                         Take these.

               She helps him to swallow, as Paul's eyes close.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               AN EXTERIOR OF THE PLACE. It's a farmhouse--we 're in a 
               desolate area with mountains in the background.

               THE HOUSE is set on a knoll so that Paul's room, although on 
               the first floor, is ten feet off the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, in the room. He's not on the I.V. anymore. His fever 
               has broken. Annie enters, pills in her hand.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here.

                                     PAUL
                         What are they...?

                                     ANNIE
                         They're called Novril--they're for 
                         your pain.
                              (helps him take them)

               ANNIE applies a cool rag to his forehead.

                                     PAUL
                         Shouldn't I be in a hospital?

                                     ANNIE
                         The  blizzard was too strong. I 
                         couldn't risk trying to get you there. 
                         I tried calling, but the phone lines 
                         are down.

               PAUL tries to test his left arm.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Gently, her fingers 
                              go to his eyelids, 
                              close them)
                         Now you mustn't tire yourself. You've 
                         got to rest, you almost died.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Sometimes her face shows the most remarkable 
               compassion. It does now.

               HOLD ON IT briefly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE UP ON PILLS IN ANNIE'S HAND

                                     ANNIE (O.S.)
                         Open wide.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               He lies in bed. His fever is gone, but he's terribly weak.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. As she lays the pills on PAUL'S TONGUE, she gives him 
               a glass of water from the nearby bed table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, swallowing eagerly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him, sympathetically.

                                     ANNIE
                         Your legs just sing grand opera when 
                         you move, don't they?
                              (Paul says nothing, 
                              but his pain is clear)
                         It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, 
                         I promise you.

                                     PAUL
                         Will I be able to walk?

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course you will. And your arm 
                         will be fine, too. Your shoulder was 
                         dislocated pretty badly, but I finally 
                         popped it back in there.
                              (proudly)
                         But what I'm most proud of is the 
                         work I did on those legs. Considering 
                         what I had around the house, I don't 
                         think there's a doctor who could 
                         have done any better.

               And now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his 
               body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S LEGS. From the knees down he resembles an Egyptian 
               mummy--she's splinted them with slim steel rods that look 
               like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and there's 
               taping circling around.

               From the kness up they're all swollen and throbbing and 
               horribly bruised and discolored.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lying back, stunned with disbelief.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's not nearly as bad as it looks. 
                         You have a compound fracture of the 
                         tibia in both legs, and the fibula 
                         in the left leg is fractured too. I 
                         could hear the bones moving, so it's 
                         best for your legs to remain immobile. 
                         And as soon as the roads open, I'll 
                         take you to a hospital.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP

                                     ANNIE
                         In the meantime, you've got a lot of 
                         recovering to do, and I consider it 
                         an honor that you'll do it in my 
                         home.

               HOLD on her ecstatic face.

               Then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MISERY'S PERFECT FACE. We're back in SINDELL's office in New 
               York. The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts 
               all over. But she doesn't.

               She holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure.

                         This is Marcia Sindell calling from 
                         New York City. I'd like to speak to 
                         the Silver Creek Chief of Police or 
                         the Sheriff.

                                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Which one do you want?

                                     SINDELL
                         Whichever one's not busy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SMALL OFFICE IN SILVER CREEK

               ...with a view of the mountains.

               A MARVELOUS LOOKING MAN sits at a desk, by himself, holding 
               the phone. In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and 
               sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago. Never mind what his 
               name is, everyone calls him BUSTER.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm pretty sure they 're both not 
                         busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're 
                         both me. I also happen to be President 
                         of the Policeman's Benefit 
                         Association, Chairman of the 
                         Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if 
                         you need a good fishing guide, you 
                         could do a lot worse; call me Buster, 
                         everybody does, what can I do for 
                         you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL in her office. She pushes the speakerphone, gets up, 
               paces; she's very hesitant when she speaks about Paul. Almost 
               embarrassed--

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm a literary agent, and I feel 
                         like a fool calling you, but I think 
                         one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, 
                         might be in some kind of trouble.

                                     BUSTER
                         Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon 
                         the writer?

                                     SINDELL
                         Yes.

                                     BUSTER
                         He's your client, huh?

                                     SINDELL
                         Yes, he is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER'S OFFICE

               He rolls a penny across the back of one hand--he's very good 
               at it, doesn't even look while he does it.

                                     BUSTER
                         People sure like those Misery books.

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm sure you know Paul's been going 
                         to the Silver Creek Lodge for years 
                         to finish his books.

                                     BUSTER
                         Yeah, I understand he's been up here 
                         the last six weeks.

                                     SINDELL
                         Not quite. I just called, and they 
                         said he checked out five days ago. 
                         Isn't that a little strange?

                                     BUSTER
                         I don't know. Does he always phone 
                         you when he checks out of hotels?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL, really embarrassed now.

                                     SINDELL
                         No, no, of course not. It's just 
                         that his daughter hasn't heard from 
                         him, and when he's got a book coming 
                         out, he usually keeps in touch. So 
                         when there was no word from him...

                                     BUSTER
                         You think he might be missing?

                                     SINDELL
                              (shakes her head)
                         I hate that I made this call--tell 
                         me I'm being silly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He nods as a WOMAN enters, carrying lunch. It's his 
               wife, VIRGINIA. She begins putting the food down on a table 
               for the both of them.

                                     BUSTER
                         Just a little over-protective, maybe.
                              (beat)
                         Tell you what--nothing's been reported 
                         out here--
                              (he puts Paul Sheldon's 
                              name with a ? on a 3 
                              x 5 CARD)
                         --but I'll put his name through our 
                         system.
                              (he tacks the card to 
                              a bulletin board)
                         And if anything turns up, I'll call 
                         you right away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL. She smiles, a genuine sense of relief.

                         I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.

                         I guess it was kind of a miracle... 
                         you finding me...

               ANNIE's soft, sweet laughter is heard. She stands over him, 
               finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor. She 
               wears what we will come to know as her regular costume--plain 
               wool skirts, grey cardigan sweaters.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in 
                         a way, I was following you.

                         Following me?

               ANNIE concentrates on shaving him with great care; she has 
               wonderful, strong hands.

                         Well, it wasn't any secret to me 
                         that you were staying at the Silver 
                         Creek, seeing as how I'm your number-
                         one fan and all. Some nights I'd 
                         just tool on down there, sit outside 
                         and look up at the light in your 
                         cabin--

                              is said with total 
                              sincerity, almost 
                              awe)
                         and I'd try to imagine what was going 
                         on in the room of the world's greatest 
                         writer.

                         Well, the other afternoon I was on 
                         my way home, and there you were, 
                         leaving the Lodge, and I wondered 
                         why a literary genius would go for a 
                         drive when there was a big storm 
                         coming.

                         I didn't know it was going to be a

                              (her voice trails off)

                                     PAUL
                         You want to read it?

                                     ANNIE
                              (quietly)
                         If you wouldn't mind.

                         I have a hard and fast rule about 
                         who can read my stuff at this early 
                         stage--only my editor, my agent, and 
                         anyone who saves me from freezing to 
                         death in a car wreck.

                                     ANNIE
                              (genuinely thrilled)
                         You'll never realize what a rare 
                         treat you've given me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. His eyes close briefly, he grimaces.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him, concerned. She glances at her watch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Boy, it's like clockwork, the way 
                         your pain comes--I'll get you your 
                         Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling 
                         away and making you feel all oogy.

               She turns and goes out of the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         What's your new book called?

                                     PAUL
                         I don't have a title yet.

                                     ANNIE
                         What's it about?

                                     PAUL
                              (fast)
                         It's crazy, but I don't really know, 
                         I mean I haven't written anything 
                         but "Misery" for so long that--you 
                         read it you can tell me what you 
                         think it's about. Maybe you can come 
                         up with a title.

                                     ANNIE
                              (in the doorway)
                         Oh, like I could do that?

               Small, neat, one window--outside, snow covers all.

               BUSTER AND LIBBY, THE MANAGER, are going over books and 
               records. Libby is an old guy, walks with a cane.

                                     LIBBY
                         Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's 
                         leaving, Buster--you can tell by the 
                         champagne.

                         Maybe you can, Libby.

                         No, see, he always ordered a bottle 
                         of Dom Perignon when he was ready to 
                         go. Then he'd pay up and be out the
                         door.

                         out of the ordinary?

                              (head shake)
                         I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for 
                         things to be out of the ordinary. 
                         Considering who he is and all, famous 
                         and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives 
                         the same car out from New York each 
                         time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him 
                         think. He was always a good guest, 
                         never made a noise, never bothered a 
                         soul. Sure hope nothing happened to 
                         him.

                         I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling 
                         into New York right now.

                         I'm sure you're right.

               But you can tell he's not sure at all as we

               PAUL'S ROOM.

               He lies in bed. Sun comes in the lone window. ANNIE sits on 
               the bed, a large bowl of soup in her hands, feeding him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (almost shy about 
                              this)
                         I know I'm only forty pages into 
                         your book, but...

               She stops, fills the spoon up again.

                                     PAUL
                         But what?

                         Nothing.

                                     PAUL
                         No, what is it?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to 
                         make a criticism to someone like 
                         you?

                                     PAUL
                         I can take it, go ahead.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, it's brilliantly written, but 
                         then everything you write is 
                         brilliant.

                                     PAUL
                         Pretty rough so far.

                              (beat)
                         There, I said it.

                         The profanity bothers you?

                         It has no nobility.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, these are slum kids, I was a 
                         slum kid, everybody talks like that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She holds the soup bowl in one hand, the muddy-colored 
               beef barley soup close to spilling.

                                     ANNIE
                         They do not. What do you think I say 
                         when I go to the feed store in town?
                         "Now, Wally, give me a bag of that 
                         effing pigfeed and ten pounds of 
                         that bitchly cow-corn"--

               PAUL is amused by this.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SOUP, almost spilling as she gets more agitated.

                         --and in the bank do I tell Mrs. 
                         Bollinger, "Here's one big bastard 
                         of a check, give me some of your 
                         Christing money."

               PAUL, almost laughing as some soup hits the coverlet.

                                     ANNIE
                              (seeing the spill, 
                              suddenly upset)
                         There! Look there! See what you made 
                         me do!

               ANNIE, and she is just totally embarrassed.

                         Oh, Paul, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
                         Sometimes I get so worked up. Can 
                         you ever forgive me? Here...

               She hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the 
               coverlet. Then she makes the sweetest smile.

                                     ANNIE
                         I love you, Paul.

                              than ever)
                         Your mind. Your creativity--that's 
                         all I meant.

               Flustered, she turns away as we--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS. Piles of snow all around but it's 
               been ploughed enough so it's driveable.

               A CAR coming into view. Up ahead is the sign we've already 
               seen: "Curved Road, Next 13 Miles."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE CAR

               BUSTER AND HIS WIFE VIRGINIA: Virginia is driving while Buster 
               intently studies the terrain. He reaches for a large thermos, 
               pours some coffee, offers it to her. She shakes her head. He 
               begins to sip it.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         This sure is fun.

               She puts her hand on his leg.

                                     BUSTER
                              (removing it)
                         Virginia, when you're in this car, 
                         you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Well, this deputy would rather be 
                         home under the covers with the 
                         Sheriff.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR. Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights 
               it back under control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Stop--stop right here.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What? What is it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR, skidding, slowing, stopping. BOTH OF THEM get out, 
               go to the edge of the road. Mountains of snow. Nothing much 
               else visible. Then Buster points.

                                     BUSTER
                         Look at that broken branch there...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, seeing it, unconvinced.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Could be the weight of the snow.

                                     BUSTER
                         Could be--or a rotten branch or a 
                         mountain lion could have landed on 
                         it. Could be a lot of things.

               He steps off the road, starts down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, watching him, worried--it's very slippery.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TREE that the car ran into. BUSTER reaches it, studies 
               it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, staring out after him--she can't see him because 
               the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds 
               of snow.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Anything down there?

                                     BUSTER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yeah. An enormous amount of snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where 
               the Mustang is buried.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MOUND OF SNOW with the Mustang inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, making his way closer to it, closer, staring around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE AREA. Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with 
               mountains of snow. You could have a house down there and not 
               be able to see it. Just glaring white.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, angry, frustrated, turning around and around and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER from another angle, from behind the mound with the 
               Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun, 
               a bit of the door protrudes. But, of course, Buster can't 
               see it.

               HOLD ON BUSTER, in a sour mood, staring around as the edge 
               of the door continues to glisten.

               CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still 
               ticked.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (they move to the car)
                         You really think Sheldon's out there?

                                     BUSTER
                         Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's 
                         go to the newspaper office.

               As they get in the car--

               ANOTHER CAR DRIVING BY--it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she 
               nor Buster notice each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               The door opens and ANNIE enters.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake 
                         you.

                                     PAUL
                         It's fine.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               Paul's eyes fluttering awake to see the hardback copy of his 
               novel, Misery's Child, in Annie's hands. She's never been 
               more excited--

                                     ANNIE
                         They had it at the store, Paul, there 
                         was a whole batch of them there. As 
                         soon as I saw it, I slammed my money
                         down. I got the first copy.

                                     PAUL
                         Then the roads are open...

                                     ANNIE
                         The one to town is, but that's about 
                         it. I called the hospital and talked 
                         to the head orthopedic surgeon. I 
                         told him who you were and what had 
                         happened. He said as long as there's 
                         no infection, you're not in any 
                         danger, and as soon as the road to 
                         the hospital is open, they'll send 
                         an ambulance for you.

                                     PAUL
                         The phones are working?

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, mine's still out. But the ones 
                         in town were working just fine. I 
                         called that agent of yours.
                              (soft now)
                         Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very 
                         beginning.
                              (looks at him)
                         What a wonderful first page--just to 
                         read the name Misery Chastain...

                                     PAUL
                         My daughter must be going nuts.

                                     ANNIE
                         ...it's like a visit from my oldest,
                         dearest friend.

                                     PAUL
                         I was supposed to be home for her 
                         birthday three days ago.

                                     ANNIE
                         Your agent said she would tell her 
                         you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll 
                         have to wait until tomorrow if you 
                         want to speak to her yourself.

               She starts to leave, stops at the door.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She looks at him now 
                              with almost a look 
                              of amazement)
                         Oh, Paul, what a poet you are...

               As she leaves--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL, watching as she enters, moves to him, carrying a tray.

                                     ANNIE
                         I made you my speciality--scrambled 
                         eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 
                         75.

                                     PAUL
                         I guess that means it's okay.

                                     ANNIE
                         No. No, it isn't, it's--
                              (halts)
                         --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. 
                         Would "great" be insulting?

                                     PAUL
                         I can live with "great."

               He starts, with effort, to eat.

                                     ANNIE
                              (as she turns, goes)
                         No, it's not just great, it's perfect, 
                         a perfect, perfect thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. MID-AFTERNOON

               ANNIE is clearing Paul's tray. She hands him his Novril; he 
               quickly swallows them.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm up to page 185. I always get sad 
                         when I pass the halfway point. Will 
                         you do me a favor? I'd love it if 
                         you would autograph my copy. I already 
                         have your autograph on a picture, 
                         but it would mean so much to me to 
                         get it in person. I know you're right-
                         handed, so don't worry if it's not 
                         so legible. I'll cherish it anyway.

               As PAUL signs the book:

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't mean to pry, but I've read 
                         in two magazines now where you were 
                         seeing this model who does those 
                         disgusting jeans commercials. And I 
                         said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon 
                         would never waste his time with a 
                         trampy woman like that.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, you can't believe everything 
                         you read in magazines.

                                     ANNIE
                         I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. 
                         Boy, how do they get away with 
                         printing stuff like that?

                                     PAUL
                         You'd be amazed at what some people 
                         will believe.

               He finishes the autograph, hands the book back to her.

                                     ANNIE
                         Thank you so much.

                                     PAUL
                         My pleasure.

               THE DOOR. IT opens and guess what--a sow lumbers in.

               PAUL, kind of stunned as this female pig skitters its way 
               around the room, excited, confused, slipping and sliding.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     ANNIE
                         I thought it was time you two should 
                         meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite 
                         beast in all the world, my sow, 
                         Misery.

               PAUL AND ANNIE, watching it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes. I told you I was your number-
                         one fan.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm getting to believe you.

                                     ANNIE
                         This farm was getting kind of dreary, 
                         what with just the few cows and 
                         chickens and me--
                              (happy)
                         But when I got Misery here, everything 
                         Changed--she just makes me smile so.

                                     PAUL
                         She's a fine... uh... pig is what 
                         she is...

                                     ANNIE
                              (scooping up the pig, 
                              holding it tight as 
                              she stands by Paul)
                         I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, 
                         and it's better than perfect--it's 
                         divine. What's the ceiling that dago 
                         painted?

                                     PAUL
                         The Sistine Chapel?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those 
                         are the only two divine things ever 
                         in this world...

               PAUL watches as the pig skitters out of the room with ANNIE 
               in pursuit, happily imitating the pig.

                                     ANNIE
                         Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK!

               PAUL staring after them--what the hell was that?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW. DUSK.

               ANNIE'S VOICE is heard softly.

                                     ANNIE
                         When my husband left me... I wasn't 
                         prepared, it wasn't an easy time...

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               ANNIE, standing at the window, her back to the room.

               In bed, PAUL is dealing with a bedpan, peeing.

                                     ANNIE
                         For a while I thought I might go 
                         crazy.

                                     PAUL
                         I know how that can be.

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't know about you, but what I 
                         did to get through it was I dove 
                         into work--days, nights--night shifts 
                         can be lonely at a hospital. I did a 
                         lot of reading. That was hen I first 
                         discovered Misery. She made me so 
                         happy. She made me forget all my 
                         problems.
                              (She smiles now)
                         'Course, I suppose you had a little 
                         something to do with that too.

               There is a peeing sound.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, well...

               He is embarrassed.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She isn't)
                         I just kept reading them over and 
                         over. I know when I finish this one--
                         and I've only got two chapters to go--
                         I'll just turn right to the front 
                         page and start reading it again.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm...

                                     ANNIE
                              (She turns around, 
                              moves to the bed)
                         Done?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, thanks.

                                     ANNIE
                         No problem.

               As she takes the bedpan...

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't get me wrong. I'm not against 
                         marriage per se. But it would take a 
                         pretty special guy to make me want 
                         to go down the aisle again.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, it's not something you should
                         enter into lightly.

                                     ANNIE
                         It boils down to respect. People 
                         just don't respect the institution 
                         of marriage any more. They have no 
                         sense of real commitment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, attempting to smile. There is not much he can say to 
               this.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'd love to stay here and chat, but 
                         I'm right at the end and I gotta 
                         find out what happens.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I hope you like it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course I'll like it. Misery's 
                         about to have her child. What's it 
                         gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't 
                         tell me.

               With that, she exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW. MOONLIGHT.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He's been dozing but now his eyes flutter awake as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR. It opens and ANNIE enters, comes to his bedside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Hard to see. He squints up as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. CLOSE UP: her face is ashen pale.

                                     ANNIE
                         You...you dirty bird. She can't be 
                         dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! 
                         How could you?

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, in 1871, women often died in 
                         childbirth, but her spirit is the 
                         important thing, and Misery's spirit 
                         is still alive--

                                     ANNIE
                              (screaming)
                         I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER!
                         And you MURDERED her!

                                     PAUL
                         I DIDN'T...

                                     ANNIE
                         Then who did?

                                     PAUL
                         No one--she just died--she slipped 
                         away, that's all.

                                     ANNIE
                              (screaming)
                         She slipped away? She slipped away? 
                         She didn't just slip away. You did 
                         it. You did it. You did it. You did 
                         it. You murdered my Misery.

               And now she has lifted a chair--it's heavy but she's very 
               strong--and she raises it and turns on Paul, and it's high 
               above her head, and PAUL realizes that this might be it, she 
               might shatter him with it, crunch his skull--and that's just 
               what she seems she's about to do--and then she swings it, 
               not against him but against the wall, and it shatters and 
               she's panting from the effort as she turns on him again, her 
               voice surprisingly soft.

                                     ANNIE
                         I thought you were good, Paul, but 
                         you're not good, you're just another 
                         lying old dirty birdie and I don't 
                         think I better be around you for 
                         awhile.
                              (she crosses to the 
                              door, then stops)
                         And don't even think about anybody 
                         coming for you, not the doctors, not 
                         your agent, not your family--because 
                         I never called them. Nobody knows 
                         you're here. And you better hope 
                         nothing happens to me because if I 
                         die, you die.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, watching as she closes the door behind her. Then there 
               is a RATTLE OF A KEY and the sound of the door to his room 
               LOCKING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting in her Cherokee and gunning away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM

               PAUL lies still. He looks around the room and listens for 
               sounds. All he hears are the SOUNDS OF A WINTER NIGHT in the 
               mountains. After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and 
               then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body 
               out of bed, to make it move.

               He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the 
               main thing: it's the pain. Any attempt at movement and his 
               legs scream. He sags back, lies there still a moment. Slowly 
               he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. He rolls over 
               onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor 
               by moving down head first. His good arm hits the floor, and 
               he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way 
               to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds 
               himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to 
               the floor.

               The pain is excruciating. After he regains his composure, he 
               slowly crawls toward the door.

               He reaches up and tries the handle. It is, in fact, locked. 
               He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is 
               much too painful and to no avail. He crawls back over to the 
               bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs

               the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes 
               his eyes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BUSTER'S OFFICE. DAY.

               He sits alone at his desk on the telephone, staring at the 
               Rocky Mountain Gazette spread in front of him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE NEWSPAPER'S FRONT PAGE

               In a prominent spot on the top is what is most likely a book-
               jacket photo of Paul. Above the picture is the following: 
               "HAVE YOU SEEN PAUL SHELDON?"

               BUSTER is on the phone with Marcia Sindell.

                                     BUSTER
                         No, Ms. Sindell, there's no point in 
                         coming up here now. Everything that 
                         can be done is... Yes, we're working 
                         closely with the state police, and 
                         the FBI has been informed. Right... 
                         Right... As soon as we know anything 
                         we'll let you know. No, it's no 
                         bother. Call anytime. Bye, Ms. 
                         Sindell.

               VIRGINIA enters, carrying some files.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Here's the list of all Sheldon's 
                         credit charges. Nothing after the 
                         Silver Creek.
                              (With a glance at his 
                              dour face, she 
                              indicates the photo)
                         Any calls?

                                     BUSTER
                         Just from his agent.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. His eyes flick up to her. An almost imperceptible 
               shake of the head.

               HOLD FOR A MOMENT, then--

               FACES. They are distorted, and they come into view but 
               briefly, then change into the next distorted face. All kinds-- 
               there is no order to them

               --young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so 
               pretty, happy, white, old--what we HEAR is this:

               "...You've changed my life..."

               "...I'm your number one fan..."

               "...I'm a really big fan of yours..."

               "...I'm your biggest fan..."

               "...Don't ever stop writing those Misery books..."

               "...I've read all your books, but the Misery's... well..."

               "...I'm your number one fan..."

               "...You've given me such pleasure..."

               "...I feel like you're writing just for me..."

               And now, it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster, 
               many times overlapping.

               "...I love you... I'm your number one fan... I'm your biggest 
               fan... We love you... number one... love you... biggest... 
               love you... number one... number one... you poor dear 
               thing..."

               This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, 
               she stays that way--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM, AS IT SNAPS BACK INTO FOCUS--ANNIE is standing by 
               the bed. It is dusk.

               She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers. 
               Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the 
               prettiest ANNIE WILKES has ever looked.

                                     ANNIE
                         What are you doing on the floor?
                              (crossing to the bed)
                         It's my fault. If I'd had a proper 
                         hospital bed, this never would have 
                         happened. Here, let me help you back 
                         in.
                              (She lifts him back 
                              into the bed, which 
                              causes considerable 
                              pain)
                         I know this hurts, but it'll only 
                         take a few seconds. There you go. 
                         Comfy?

                                     PAUL
                              (in pain)
                         Perfect.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're such a kidder. I have a big 
                         surprise for you. But first there's
                         something you must do.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't suppose I could have a little 
                         snack while I wait for the
                         surprise?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'll get you everything you want, 
                         but you must listen first. Sometimes 
                         my thinking is a little muddy, I 
                         accept that. It's why I couldn't 
                         remember all those things they were 
                         asking me on the witness stand in 
                         Denver.

               Now she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking. She 
               is never out of sight.

                                     ANNIE
                         But this time I thought clearly. I 
                         asked God about you and God said "I 
                         delivered him unto you so that you 
                         may show him the way."

                                     PAUL
                         Show me the way?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes.

               She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed. 
               It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for 
               cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a 
               box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter 
               fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE AND PAUL. He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, 
               puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the 
               charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is 
               close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match.

                                     PAUL
                         When I mentioned a snack, I was 
                         thinking more along the lines of a
                         cheese and crackers kind of thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, looking at him.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, this is no time for jokes. You 
                         must rid the world of this filth.

               She hands him the box of kitchen matches.

                                     PAUL
                         You want me to burn my book?

                                     ANNIE
                              (she nods)
                         Yes.

                                     PAUL
                         You want me to burn my book?

                                     ANNIE
                         I know this may be difficult for 
                         you, but it's for the best.

                                     PAUL
                         This isn't difficult, my agent's 
                         made dozens of copies. There's gonna 
                         be an auction on this, and every 
                         publishing house in New York is 
                         reading it now. So if you want me to 
                         burn it, fine. You're not ridding 
                         the world of anything.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (quietly)
                         Then light the match, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         No big deal.

                                     ANNIE
                         So you've indicated. Do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MATCHES. PAUL'S HANDS are starting to tremble now. He 
               can't do it.

                                     ANNIE
                         I know this is the only copy, Paul. 
                         When you were twenty-four you wrote 
                         your first book and you didn't make 
                         a copy, because you didn't think 
                         anybody would take it seriously. But 
                         they did. And ever since you've never 
                         made any copies because you're 
                         superstitious--it's why you always 
                         come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. 
                         You told that story to Merv Griffin 
                         eleven years ago.

                                     PAUL
                         You know, Annie, this book never 
                         would have survived without you. 
                         When it gets to new York, there will 
                         be a big auction, and whatever it 
                         brings we can split.
                              (pause)
                         God knows you're entitled to it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. 
                         It's about decency and purity. It's 
                         about God's values.

                                     PAUL
                         You're right. You're right. I don't 
                         know what I was thinking. I'll tell 
                         you what. It doesn't have to be 
                         published. Nobody ever has to see 
                         it. I'll just keep it for myself. No 
                         one will ever have to know it exists.

                                     ANNIE
                         As long as it does exist, your mind 
                         won't ever be free. I think you should 
                         light the match, Paul.

               There is a long silence. PAUL doesn't move.

                                     ANNIE
                         Can't you see it's what God wants?

               She's holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she 
               speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on 
               the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're so brilliant. I would think 
                         you'd certainly be able to see that.
                              (More drops fall on 
                              the bed)
                         We're put on this earth to help 
                         people, Paul. Like I'm trying to 
                         help you.

               PAUL watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Please let me help you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. His hands shaking. Almost robot-like, he strikes one. 
               It flames.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're doing the right thing, Paul.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE, as Paul's hand appears, drops the match on the 
               fluid-soaked manuscript. For a moment--nothing--

               --and then, KABOOM, the goddamn thing practically explodes 
               and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring, dazed, and as the flames leap higher,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, suddenly scared and startled at the heat and the size 
               of the flames and the full baking heat and

                                     ANNIE
                              (crying out)
                         Goodness!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE. The sound is LOUDER as the flames leap up and 
               now charred bits of paper begin floating upward and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching, as more bits of paper rise.

                                     ANNIE
                         Goodness--Goodness--Oh, my gracious--

               And she starts trying to catch them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PIECE OF BURNING PAPER in midair, floating against the 
               gauzy curtain, and for a moment it looks like the curtain 
               will catch fire and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, panicked, racing out of the room, going "Goodness, 
               heavens to Betsy"--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE, and what's left of the book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and he cannot take his eyes off the disaster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, hurrying back in, carrying a big bucket, slopping 
               water as she lifts the bucket.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LAST of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed 
               onto it--there's hissing and steam and as the steam clears 
               it all looks now like a log in a brackish pond.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

               As she starts to wheel the barbecue out, suddenly there is a 
               new and different sound as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, head turning toward the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE taking  a step toward the window, stopping for a moment. 
               The sound we're hearing is a motor. A HELICOPTER MOTOR. And 
               it's getting louder. Annie goes to the window now, looks 
               toward the sky as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HELICOPTER flying along.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

               BUSTER and a PILOT are in the machine. Buster has a pair of 
               binoculars looped around his neck, a map rumpled in his lap.

                                     BUSTER
                              (pointing out)
                         That's the Steadman place up there.
                              (The pilot nods. Buster 
                              points again)
                         The only other place up here is the 
                         Wilkes farm.

               Another nod. The PILOT points down. BUSTER stares through 
               the binoculars.

               WHAT HE SEES: ANNIE'S JEEP parked in front of her house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

                                     BUSTER
                         That's no '65 Mustang. There's nothing

                         I do believe the winters are getting 
                         shorter and shorter every year. People 
                         say it has something to do with the 
                         ozone layer. What do you think?

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's 
                         your Novril.
                              (she wheels the 
                              barbecue to the door; 
                              stops)
                         How does tuna casserole sound for 
                         dinner?

                                     PAUL
                         Great.

               She exits. PAUL takes the two Novril, stares at them, then 
               deliberately tucks them under his mattress.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               As PAUL is finishing the last of his tuna casserole. There 
               are two Novrils on his tray. We hear strains of TV GAME SHOW 
               THEME MUSIC. These sounds are not surprising. Paul has heard 
               them before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               It is much smaller than Paul's and filled with religious 
               bric-a-brac, pictures of Paul Sheldon, and a TV on a portable 
               stand. Annie lies in bed, with an open bag of Cheetos resting 
               on her stomach and a big quart-sized plastic bottle of Coke 
               on the nightstand. As she munches away, she is heavily 
               engrossed in her favorite TV show, "The Love Connection." As 
               Chuck Woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couple's 
               romantic interlude, we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Paul faintly hearing the sounds of the TV. He has now finished 
               eating. He takes the two Novril from under the mattress. He 
               then undoes the sheet, takes his fork and delicately pokes a 
               hole in the mattress, then stuffs all four pills back into 
               the hole.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FARMHOUSE

               Coming up to dawn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S DOOR slowly opening.

               PAUL, staring at  the door.

               WHEELS, seen from underneath the bed, being rolled around 
               the foot of the bed. We realize PAUL is in a wheelchair with 
               ANNIE pushing him.

                                     ANNIE
                         See, isn't this nice?

                                     PAUL
                         Great. I've always wanted to visit 
                         the other side of the room.

                                     ANNIE
                         And look what I've got for you. An 
                         electric razor so you can shave 
                         yourself now.

                                     PAUL
                         If I knew this was gonna be the 
                         surprise, you could've gotten me to
                         burn all my books.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She hands him some 
                              Novril)
                         Now don't josh. This is a very big 
                         day for you, Paul. Here. You just 
                         sit tight, and I'll set everything 
                         up.

               ANNIE exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, quickly shoving the Novril into the mattress.

                                     PAUL
                         Set what up?

                                     ANNIE
                         That's the big surprise. Your new 
                         studio--after all, writers do need a 
                         place to work.

                                     PAUL
                         Work? You mean write? What in the 
                         world do you think I'd write?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, but Paul!
                              (flushed)
                         I don't think, I know! Now that you've 
                         gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, 
                         you can go back to doing what you're

                         your greatest achievement ever--
                         Misery's Return.

                         I know you didn't mean it when you 
                         killed her, and now you'll make it 
                         right.

                         Yes. It will be a book in my honor. 
                         For saving your life and nursing you 
                         back to health. I'll be the first

                         Oh, Paul, you're going to make me 
                         the envy of the whole world...

                         You just expect me to whip something 
                         off, that it?

                                     ANNIE
                              (nods)
                         I expect nothing less than your 
                         masterpiece.

                                     PAUL
                         You do understand that this isn't 
                         the ordinary way books get written--
                         I mean, some people might actually 
                         consider this an oddball situation.

               She rolls him over to a table she has set up by the window.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have total confidence in your 
                         brilliance--besides, the view will
                         inspire you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW, as the wheelchair approaches it.

               The sky is innocent of clouds. There's a green forest climbing 
               the flank of the nearest mountain. A plot of open ground 
               between the house and the mountain. A neat red barn where 
               the livestock stay. A Jeep Cherokee, maybe five years old. A 
               Fisher plow. And no neighbors in sight. This is a desolate 
               place.

                                     ANNIE
                         You just inhale that. I'll be right 
                         back.

                              (calling out)
                         I guess you don't get bothered by
                         neighbors much.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't worry about that. You'll have 
                         total solitude so you can concentrate 
                         on your work.

                                     PAUL
                         Great.

               PAUL, watching her--it's all kind of amazing. She hands him 
               a box of typing paper.

                         I got you this expensive paper to 
                         type on.

               PAUL, looking at the paper. It's Corrasable Bond. An idea 
               hits him; he masks it as best he can.

                                     ANNIE

                              the paper on the 
                              table)
                         And I got a great deal on this fifty-
                         pound clunker--on account of it's 
                         missing an "n." I told the saleslady 
                         "n" was one of the letters in my 
                         favorite writer's name.

                                     PAUL
                         It's two of the letters in my favorite 
                         nurse's name, Annie.

                         You did great, except there's just 
                         one little thing--I can't work with 
                         this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it 
                         smudges. Maybe you could go back 
                         into town and bring me some white, 
                         long-grained mimeo.

                         see how it could smudge.

                         Well, it does smudge after all--isn't 
                         that fascinating?

                         Annie. Not just the finished book, 
                         but how it's written.

                                     ANNIE
                         Thank you for thinking of me.

                              when she wants)
                         Anything else I can get while I'm in 
                         town? Any other crucial requirements 
                         that need satisfying? Would you like 
                         a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a 
                         handmade set of writing slippers?

                                     PAUL
                         No, just the paper will be fine.

                                     ANNIE
                              (suddenly very agitated)
                         Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, 
                         I'll bring back the whole store for 
                         you.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, what's the matter?

                                     ANNIE
                         What's the matter? I'll tell you 
                         what's the matter. I go out of my 
                         way for you. I do everything to try 
                         and make you happy. I feed you, I 
                         clean you, I dress you. And what 
                         thanks do I get? "You bought the 
                         wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on 
                         this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get 
                         your stupid paper, but you just better 
                         start showing me a little more 
                         appreciation around here, Mister 
                         Man.

               With that, she throws the ream of paper in PAUL'S LAP, causing 
               considerable pain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as she slams it shut, locks it, stomps off and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW. Annie, in a parka, can be seen storming out in 
               the direction where her Cherokee was parked. She gets in and 
               drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He heaves a sigh, reaches out toward his tortured knees, 
               then drops his head. He sees something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BOBBY PIN on the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he moves toward the bobby pin. Or tries to. It's 
               brutally hard for him. The chair moves half a foot. Stops. 
               Paul strains again. Another half foot. Another.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The BOBBY PIN. The wheelchair is beside it now. PAUL reaches 
               down for it. Can't make it. Tries again. Can't. He takes a 
               deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain. The 
               bobby pin is in his hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to 
               jimmy the lock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LOCK--it makes a SOUND--something has caught.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing 
               great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor 
               again.

                                     PAUL
                              (furious)
                         Shit...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BOBBY PIN. Paul reaches for it. The pain has him. He 
               reaches again, involuntarily cries out. But he grabs it, 
               clutches it tight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYHOLE. Paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time.

               No luck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. In wild frustration.

                                     PAUL
                         You've written how to do this--now 
                         do it!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYHOLE. There is a loud CLICKING sound.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as Paul turns the knob. The door opens a crack.

                                     PAUL
                              (amazed)
                         What do you know, it actually works.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because 
               in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up 
               to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it 
               out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's 
               wheels is an effort for him. He works at it and works at it, 
               but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally 
               he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone. 
               Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door, 
               tries it. It's locked from the outside.

                                     PAUL
                         What a surprise.

               He looks off into the living room, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TELEPHONE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, wheeling into the living room. Dark red predominates. 
               It's a musty room. Over the mantel, a photograph of a six-
               year-old ANNIE, with her mother and father in front of the 
               family car--a new 1952 Buick. These were happier times.

               The windows have bars on them.

               As PAUL begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PHONE as PAUL at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the 
               "operator" button--

                                     PAUL
                         Operator...
                              (nothing)
                         ...OPERATOR...
                              (wildly frustrated)
                         ...Shit!

               He shakes the phone. It's terribly light. He picks it up, 
               turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone. He 
               stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the 
               disappointment plain.

                                     PAUL
                         You crazy bitch...

               He puts the phone back on the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE GENERAL STORE. DAY.

               Annie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her 
               Cherokee and drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STUDY, as PAUL enters. He looks around.

               It's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots 
               of coffee tables covered with knickknacks. As he, with effort, 
               wheels across it--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A shelf of BOOKS. PAUL SHELDON books. EVERY Paul Sheldon 
               book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, pausing, looking at her collection. The only book on 
               the shelf that isn't his is a large scrapbook. The title on 
               the back reads "My Life."

               He glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair 
               across the study, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SMALL TABLE with little ceramic doodads on top. The 
               wheelchair his it, one of the doodads topples--it's a penguin, 
               fragile looking, and as it's about to fall to the floor and 
               shatter--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing for it, catching it, putting it back where it 
               was. He continues his slow way across the room and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HALLWAY.

               Out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, PAUL 
               notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly 
               it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the  
               house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but 
               canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke 
               containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he 
               notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees 
               all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of 
               strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and 
               stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry 
               door and heads to the kitchen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               As PAUL approaches it. He starts to wheel his way in, but he 
               has trouble.

               He backs up slightly, wheels forward again--

               --but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through. 
               He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BACK DOOR. It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to 
               the outside. It seems somehow less formidable than the front 
               door did. The windows around the kitchen are barred.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at the kitchen door--

               --then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower 
               himself out of the chair

               gently to the floor--

               --only it doesn't work that way. It's too awkward, he doesn't 
               have the strength to maneuver properly--

               --and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard 
               against the hard floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a 
               moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He 
               is hurting.

               He closes his eyes, gathering strength--

               --and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his 
               body across the floor toward the kitchen door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. It's still a long way away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body 
               move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Closer now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is 
               just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and 
               up and grabs the doorknob--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Locked solid.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his 
               face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting 
               from his effort. Then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his 
               wild excitement, as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               Sitting on the counter: A SET OF CARVING KNIVES sticking out 
               of a slotted wooden block.

               They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him. He 
               starts to crawl over to the counter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD

               ANNIE is driving along in her Cherokee. She is heading home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               Now at the counter, PAUL tries to pull himself up with his 
               one good arm, but even though he is able to chin himself up 
               to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the 
               knives. He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing 
               to the floor.

               As he starts to force his way up again--from outside there 
               comes a sound--the motor of a car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, driving up to the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               PAUL, throwing himself back to the floor, starting a wild 
               crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, getting out of her Jeep and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KITCHEN

               PAUL, crawling, crawling and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, walking around to the back of the Jeep and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KITCHEN

               PAUL, scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair, starting to 
               get it turned and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, opening the back of the Jeep and lifting out several 
               rectangular boxes of paper and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, straightened out now, forcing the wheelchair to move, 
               and now we're into a race, a crazed life-and-death race and 
               the cuts go fast--

               --and ANNIE closes the door of the car--

               --and PAUL is suddenly stuck, there's no traction on the rug--

               -- ow ANNIE, purchases in hand, starts away from the car for 
               the house--

               --and now PAUL is finally moving toward the bedroom.

               --and ANNIE is moving swiftly toward the front door.

               -- he drops one of the packages of paper.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still biting down, churning his arms with all the 
               strength he has left. PAUL'S ARMS, aching, start to turn to 
               rubber.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S FEET, walking quickly across the snow-covered area 
               in front of the house and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BEDROOM DOOR as Paul gets through it, shuts it, and 
               attacks the bedroom lock with the bobby pin and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, unlocking the front door of the house and

               THE BEDROOM DOOR, as it locks and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FRONT DOOR, unlocking and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE balancing the bundles under her chin as she jiggles 
               the key out of the front door lock and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, soaked.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                              (her voice from the 
                              hallway, close and 
                              growing closer)
                         Paul, I've got your paper.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He wheels to exactly where he was when she left him. 
               He at last allows himself a sigh of relief.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as the sound of a lock CLICKING is heard.

                                     ANNIE
                         Just the kind you asked for.

               And as the door opens--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--looking down. Paul's waistband--a half a dozen strips 
               of Novril ominously stick out.

               As the door swings open, he quickly covers the Novril with 
               this hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, in the doorway, a strange look on her face.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, you're dripping with 
                         perspiration, your color is very 
                         hectic--what have you been doing?

                                     PAUL
                         You know goddamn well what I've been 
                         doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE 
                         SUFFERING. I need my pills.

                                     ANNIE
                              (tenderly, as she 
                              starts toward him)
                         Poor dear... Let's get you back in 
                         bed and I'll get them for you.

                                     PAUL
                              (exploding--a real 
                              child's tantrum)
                         I want my pills NOW!

                                     ANNIE
                         It'll only take a second.

                                     PAUL
                         I want my pain to go 'way, Annie--
                         make it go 'way, please Annie--
                              (She looks at him--
                              you can't tell if 
                              she's buying it or 
                              not)
                         --please...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She stares a moment more, then turns, starts for the 
               door.

                                     ANNIE
                              (upset)
                         It just breaks my heart to see you
                         like this...

               CUT TO:

               PAUL watching, and the instant she is out the door in the 
               hallway, he stuffs the Novril into his pants.

                                     ANNIE (O.S.)
                              (coming closer)
                         I've done a lot of thinking on the 
                         drive...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, entering the room, the Novril in her hand. She is 
               genuinely contrite.

                                     ANNIE
                         ...and I'm absolutely convinced that 
                         the main reason I've never been more 
                         popular is because of my temper. You
                         must be so mad at me. The truth now.

               She hands him the pills. And rolls him over to the bed.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I don't  hold grudges. After 
                         all, who doesn't let off a little 
                         steam once in a while.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL putting the pills in his mouth, as she picks him up 
               from the chair and puts him gently down in bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         My genius needs his rest before he
                         writes.

               She hands him a pad and pencil.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here, in case you think of any ideas.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too 
                         much.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. 
                         Think of me as your inspiration.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOORWAY, as ANNIE starts to it.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have faith in you...
                              (beat)
                         ...my darling...

               On that she turns--for the first time, a coquettish look 
               comes to her face.

                                     ANNIE
                         Catch this--
                              (she throws him a 
                              kiss--it's grotesque)
                         --ummmm-wahhhh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, summoning up all his courage, as he mimes catching it 
               and forces a smile on. She waves, closes the door.

               HOLD ON PAUL. The smile dies. He reaches in and pulls the 
               two Novril capsules out of his mouth. Now--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

               BUSTER AND PILOT flying along. Buster is all bundled up as 
               he stares out, using the binoculars...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SOMETHING SHINY reflecting the sun.

               HOLD AS IT ALMOST BLINDS US--we're looking at the part of 
               Paul's Mustang that was revealed by the snow when Buster 
               almost found the car.

                                     BUSTER
                              (to Pilot)
                         Walter, we could be skipping lunch 
                         today.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CRASH SITE

               Paul's car being hoisted by chains from the ground and, as 
               it starts to rise up into the afternoon air...

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               THE AREA BY THE CAR--BUSTER is there and a bunch of STATE 
               POLICEMEN and various MEDIA PEOPLE are there--Buster stands 
               with the STATE POLICE CHIEF watching as the car is hoisted 
               via derrick; the sound of the powerful MOTOR lifting the car 
               is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher 
               and PEOPLE take pictures and stare and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STATE POLICE CHIEF is addressing maybe a dozen REPORTERS. 
               It's very cold. BUSTER stands slightly away from the group.

                                     STATE POLICE CHIEF
                         The presumption must now be that 
                         Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he 
                         somehow crawled out of his car. But 
                         we have been unable to locate his 
                         body in the vicinity of the crash. 
                         We also know if anyone had found 
                         him, they would have taken him to an 
                         area hospital. His body is undoubtedly 
                         out there buried somewhere in the 
                         snow. We'll find him after the first 
                         thaw--unless the animals have gotten 
                         to him first.
                              (beat)
                         I'll take questions.

               After the first sentence, a very cold and very unhappy BUSTER 
               leaves the gathering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S CAR as Buster studies it, especially the area by the 
               driver's side where there are still dents visible from Annie's 
               crowbar.

               VIRGINIA moves to him now. They exchange a glance, start 
               walking together toward their car.

               THE CHIEF, surrounded--people are asking questions, raising 
               hands for attention, and as he answers them--

                         You don't think he's dead, do you?

                         He might well be. But not the way 
                         they say. He didn't crawl out of 
                         that car by himself. You saw those 
                         dents on the door--someone pulled 
                         him out.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         It was an old car--those dents could 
                         have been there forever.

                         There's two kinds of people that 
                         drive around in old cars: the ones 
                         that can't afford new ones, and the 
                         ones who wouldn't give 'em up for 
                         anything in the world. That second
                         bunch don't drive around with twenty-
                         five-year-old dents.

               As they drive off...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               PAUL lies in bed listening to the strains of "The Love 
               Connection," coming from upstairs. As Chuck Woolery drones 
               on, Paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper 
               from his pad. He is making a container of some sort. He 
               finishes, then reaches down and grabs the Novril capsules 
               that he has been stashing in the mattress.

               Carefully, he opens one and pours it into the palm of his 
               hand. First he smells it--no odor--then he takes a tiny bit 
               on a finger and tastes it--no taste. Then, he takes his paper 
               container and empties the contents of all the pills into it, 
               then places it under the mattress.

               Now, what to do with the empty capsules. He thinks for a 
               second, then--what the hell--he swallows them. He then places 
               the packet back in the mattress.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER. DAY.

               The window is visible behind it. From this angle, it almost 
               seems to be staring at PAUL, broken "n" and all. PAUL tests 
               his wounded arm. He's able to raise it a few inches, but 
               that's it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

               ANNIE is visible heading for the barn, followed by MISERY, 
               the pig. For a moment, she stops, turns to look back.

                                     ANNIE
                              (calling out)

                         --just remember, I'll treasure 
                         whatever you do.

               Now, as she turns again, moves quickly away--

               PAUL. He rolls in a piece of paper, types briefly.

               PAUL, studying the paper. He takes it out, starts to roll in 
               a new sheet.

               PAUL, staring at the blank page. He takes a deep breath, 
               glances outside, then back to the paper.

               PAUL, and now there's a brief light behind his eyes and 
               suddenly he types a burst, stares at what he's written.

               PAUL. He closes his eyes briefly, mutters something, kind of 
               nods, opens his eyes, grabs for another piece of paper, rolls 
               it in and starts mechanically to type.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL WORKING in his room. ANNIE  enters, the first pages of 
               manuscript in her hands. It's dusk.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, 
                         you'll have to do it over again.

                                     PAUL
                              (totally stunned)
                         What? What happened to "I'll treasure
                         whatever you do?"

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw 
                         it all out except for the part of 
                         naming that gravedigger after me. 
                         You can leave that in.

                                     PAUL
                         I really value your criticism, but 
                         maybe you're being a little hasty 
                         here.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, what you've written just isn't 
                         fair.

                                     PAUL
                         --not fair?

                         That's right--when I was growing up 
                         in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in 
                         all the world was to go to the movies 
                         on Saturday afternoons for the chapter 
                         plays...

                                     PAUL
                              (it just comes out)
                         --cliff-hangers--

                              (suddenly angry)
                         I know that, Mister Man--they also 
                         call them serials. I'm not stupid, 
                         you know.
                              (and she's a child 
                              again)
                         Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, 
                         and once it was a no-brakes chapter, 
                         the bad guys stuck him in a car on a 
                         mountain road and knocked him out 
                         and welded the doors shut and tore 
                         out the brakes and started him to 
                         his death and he woke up and tried 
                         to steer and tried to get out, but 
                         the car went off a cliff before he 
                         could escape and it crashed and burned 
                         and--I was so upset and excited and 
                         the next week you better believe I 
                         was first in line and they always 
                         start with the end of the last week 
                         and there was Rocket Man trying to 
                         get out, and here came the cliff and 
                         JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped 
                         free and all the kids cheered--
                              (standing up now)
                         --but I didn't cheer, I stood right 
                         up and started shouting, "This isn't 
                         what happened last week--have you 
                         all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED 
                         US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Still in her childhood reverie. Shouting:

                         "HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE 
                         CAR!"

                                     PAUL
                         They always cheated like that in 
                         cliff--
                              (stops himself)
                         --chapter plays.

                         But not you. Not with my Misery. 
                         Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary 
                         at the end of the last book, but his 
                         horse fell jumping that fence and 
                         Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs 
                         and lay there all night in the ditch 
                         so he never reached the doctor, so 
                         there couldn't have been any 
                         "experimental blood transfusion" 
                         that saved her life. Misery was buried 
                         in the ground at the end, Paul, so 
                         you'll have to start there.

               As she goes--

                                     PAUL
                         Look at this, I've got Lizzie Borden 
                         for an editor, here.

               PAUL slumps, staring barefully at the typewriter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NEXT MORNING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

               PAUL is at the table. He takes the Novril off his breakfast 
               tray, wheels over to the bed, and stuffs them into the 
               mattress. He hears FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. He smoothly 
               wheels back to the table. A pause.

               ANNIE enters to remove the tray.

                                     ANNIE
                         What's the matter, Paul? You haven't 
                         written a word.

                                     PAUL
                         I can't write this anymore.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't be silly. Of course you can.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm telling you, I can't.

                                     ANNIE
                         You can--you have the "gotta"--

                                     PAUL
                         The what?

                                     ANNIE
                         The "gotta." Remember, you talked 
                         about it in Playboy magazine. You 
                         said there's a million things you 
                         can't do in this world; you can't 
                         hit a curve ball, you can't fix a 
                         leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- 
                         but there's one thing you always 
                         have, and that's the power of the 
                         "gotta."

                                     PAUL
                         I said that?

                                     ANNIE
                         You said you can make it so they 
                         gotta turn the page. You know, "I 
                         'gotta' know will she live," "I
                         'gotta' know will he catch the

                         ends." You said it. I don't usually 
                         buy that magazine. I only got it, 
                         'cause they were interviewing you.

                              (quietly)
                         What about a bee...?

                         What?

                                     PAUL
                         Nothing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               start to move. Annie stands there for a moment, then quietly 
               backs out of the room.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WINDOW. It's late afternoon.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               PAUL in the wheelchair watching as ANNIE finishes reading.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?

                                     ANNIE
                         You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian 
                         realized that the reason they'd buried 
                         Misery alive was because the bee 
                         sting had put her in that temporary 
                         coma--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, in a fervor.

                         --and when Gravedigger Wilkes 
                         remembered how thirty years earlier, 
                         the same thing had happened to Lady 
                         Evelyn-Hyde--
                              (hands clasped)
                         --and then old Dr. Cleary deduced 
                         that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's 
                         long-lost daughter because of the 
                         rarity of deadly bee-stings--my heart 
                         just leapt.

               PAUL, watching her. It's as if he had nothing to do with 
               anything she's read as she goes on.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've known from the very first book 
                         that Misery had to be born of nobility 
                         and I was right!

                                     PAUL
                              (mumbling  to himself)
                         Yeah, yeah...

               rubbing gently with the tips of her fingers.

                         Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter 
                         when you finish? I can fill in the 
                         "n"s.
                              (Paul nods, and she's 
                              off again)
                         Will she be her old self, now that 
                         Ian has dug her out, or will she 
                         have amnesia...?

                                     PAUL
                         ...have to wait.

                         Will she still love him with that 
                         special perfect love?

                                     PAUL
                         Have to wait.

                         Not even a hint?

               Paul shakes his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, 
                         it's so romantic--this whole house 
                         is going to be filled with romance. 
                         I'm going to put on my Liberace 
                         records--
                              (Stops, looks at Paul)
                         --you do like Liberace, don't you?

                                     PAUL
                              (quickly)
                         Whenever he played Radio City, who 
                         do you think was right there in the
                         front row?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm going to play my records all day

                                     LONG
                         --to inspire you--he's my all-time 
                         favorite.

               And with that, she starts to leave.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie?

               She stops at the door.

                                     PAUL
                         Would you have dinner with me tonight?

               She can't speak.

                                     PAUL
                         To celebrate Misery's return. I 
                         couldn't have done it without you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.

               ANNIE dashes excitedly out of the room. PAUL wheels over to 
               the bed, pulls the packet of Novril powder out from the 
               mattress and stuffs it in his pants. The sound of Liberace 
               playing "Tammy" with orchestra and chorus booms in from beyond 
               the door.

                                     PAUL
                         Jesus Christ.

               VIRGINIA is on the phone.

                              (into phone)
                         No, he's not here. I don't know where 
                         he went. He never tells me anything 
                         anymore. He's probably out having an 
                         affair somewhere. Wait a minute. I 
                         think I hear him coming.

               BUSTER enters carrying a bagful of books.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (to Buster)
                         It's Jim Taylor. He wants to know 
                         who you've been having an affair 
                         with.

               BUSTER. He puts the bag down, shoots Virginia a look and 
               grabs the phone. VIRGINIA looks in the bag.

                         Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh-
                         huh... Jim, we've been over this. If 
                         you're gonna have benches in front 
                         of your store, people are gonna sit 
                         on them. I don't like him either, 
                         but I'm not going to come over there 
                         and tell him to move. Give my best 
                         to Denise. Bye.

                         to read a lot.

                                     BUSTER
                         Virginia, I'm flattered you think I 
                         got that much energy. I just figured 
                         if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at 
                         least I can find out what he wrote 
                         about.

                         cliff in a snowstorm?

                         Now, you see, it's that kind of 
                         sarcasm that's given our marriage
                         real spice.

               STUDY. NIGHT.

               PAUL is sitting at a table that Annie has set up with her 
               best china and silverware. It is as romantic as Annie Wilkes 
               gets. ANNIE enters, carrying a basket of rolls. She sits and 
               serves Paul.

                                     ANNIE
                         I hope you like it.

                                     PAUL
                         It looks wonderful. And so do you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh...

               They eat in awkward silence. Finally:

                                     PAUL
                         I've never had meatloaf this good,
                         what do you do to it?

                                     ANNIE
                         My secret is I only use fresh 
                         tomatoes, never canned. And to give 
                         it that little extra zip, I mix in
                         some Spam with the ground beef.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh.
                              (pause)
                         You can't get this in a restaurant 
                         in New York.

               After another pause:

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, I think we should have a toast.

                                     ANNIE
                         A toast?

                                     PAUL
                         Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some
                         more wine.

               Paul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass.

                                     ANNIE
                         To Misery.

                                     PAUL
                         Wait, let's do this right. Do you 
                         have any candles?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll 
                         go look.

               She exits into the kitchen. PAUL quickly pulls the packet 
               filled with Novril powder from his pants. He empties it into 
               her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his 
               pants, talking the whole time:

                                     PAUL
                         Did you study decorating, or do you 
                         just have a flair?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, you. I just picked things up 
                         over the years.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, it certainly says you.

                                     ANNIE
                         You really think so?

                                     PAUL
                         Absolutely. Listen, if you can't 
                         find any, it's okay. I just thought
                         it might be nice.

               ANNIE re-enters with a candle.

                                     ANNIE
                         Are you kidding? If anyone ever told 
                         me that one day I'd be having a 
                         candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon 
                         in my own house, I woulda checked 
                         both legs to see which one was being 
                         pulled. Will this do?

                                     PAUL
                         It's perfect.

               She places the candle on the table. With a slight tremor in 
               her hand, she lights the candle. PAUL raises his glass.

                                     PAUL
                         To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who 
                         brought her back to life.

               ANNIE raises her glass.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, every time I think about 
                         it, I get goosebumps.

               They clink glasses.

               And with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, 
               she knocks over the candle. In trying to right the situation, 
               she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the 
               candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine.

                                     ANNIE
                              (wiping up the spilled 
                              wine with her napkin)
                         Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so 
                         sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful 
                         toast. Will you ever forgive me? 
                         Here, let me pour another one.
                              (she does)
                         Can we pretend this never happened? 
                         To Misery?

                                     PAUL
                         To Misery.

               So they drink their wine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. DAY.

               The snow, although still present, has melted somewhat. And 
               starting now and continuing throughout is this: the sound of 
               typing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER sitting in his den reading a Misery novel by the fire. 
               VIRGINIA brings him a cup of tea.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

               PAUL, the sling off, moving his injured arm. It's more mobile 
               than before. Testing his strength, he uses his arm to remove 
               the page and place it on the pile. He puts in another page 
               and continues to type.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Paul, this is positively the best 
                         Misery you've ever written.

                                     PAUL
                         I think you're right.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, out by the barn. She stares in at the house. Framed 
               in the window is PAUL, working. She smiles, enters the barn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               He stretches but only briefly, then back to his typing.

               PAUL'S ROOM

               PAUL, arm out of the sling. He manages to lift the typewriter 
               once, sets it back down, puts the sling back on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, bringing a tray of food.

                                     ANNIE
                         I think it's so wonderful that Misery 
                         would sacrifice her title to take up 
                         the cause of her people. That's true 
                         nobility.

               Paul hands her some new pages. As she exits,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Annie is reading by the fire. Her pig Misery sits beside 
               her, staring at the pages.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               His lips move silently. He's not even aware of it as he nods 
               and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The pile of manuscript has doubled. Maybe two hundred pages.

               PAUL, with some effort, is pumping the typewriter up and 
               down. Finally, he places it back down and puts his arm back 
               in the sling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE RAIN. Worse. The SOUND hit s the roof of the house, hits 
               the window.

               ANNIE, lumbering in--she's never looked like this: She's 
               wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat. Her 
               eyes are without life. Her hair, loose and straggly, hangs 
               around her face. Slowly, like a  robot, she goes to PAUL, 
               who looks silently up at her.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here's your pills.

               She drops them on the table.

                         The rain... sometimes it gives me 
                         the blues.

               ANNIE, seen straight on. No light in her eyes.

                                     ANNIE
                         When you first came here, I only 
                         loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. 
                         But now I know I love the rest of 
                         him too. As much as Misery loves 
                         Ian.
                              (beat)
                         I know you don't love me--don't say 
                         you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, 
                         famous man of the world; and I'm...not 
                         a movie star type. You'll never know 
                         the fear of losing someone like you 
                         if you're someone like me.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would you lose me?

                                     ANNIE
                         The book is almost finished. Your 
                         legs are getting better. Soon you'll 
                         be able to walk. You'll be wanting
                         to leave.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would I want to leave? I like it
                         here.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's very kind of you, but I'll 
                         bet it's not altogether true.

                                     PAUL
                         It is.

               She slowly reaches into the pocket of her bathrobe and pulls 
               out a .38 Special.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have this gun, and sometimes I 
                         think about using it.

               She is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun.

                                     ANNIE
                         I better go now. I might put bullets 
                         in it.

               Robot-like, she crosses to the door and leaves. As she closes 
               and locks the door--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stunned, listening, waiting--

               --here is the sound of the front door closing--

               --then footsteps on the outside walk--

               --the sound of a car door opening and slamming shut.

               Now comes the GUNNING of the motor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW as ANNIE drives by, hunched over the wheel. The 
               MOTOR sound grows fainter, faint...

               ANNIE'S KITCHEN.

               The kitchen KNIVES on the counter.

               PAUL, now using both arms, forcing his body up toward them.

               This isn't easy, it was a bitch the first time he tried it, 
               but nothing's going to stop him now. He's leaning against 
               the cupboard, using it for balance--

               --his balance starts to go but he won't let it as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KNIVES, AS HIS HAND grabs the largest one, a fat-handled 
               sharp beauty and

               PAUL, and you can sense the relief as he begins to lower 
               himself to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STUDY

               PAUL, back in his wheelchair, knife in his lap, carefully 
               opening drawers of little tables, looking inside. He closes 
               them, moves on, unmindful of the rain. Now--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SHELF OF PAUL SHELDON BOOKS. As before--

               --except the "My Life" scrapbook is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, glancing around--

               --and there it is, on a coffee table in the living room. 
               Also on the table are a roll of Scotch tape, a pair of 
               scissors, and a copy of Newsweek. Paul wheels toward the 
               table and the book, which is as big as a folio Shakespeare 
               play and as thick as a family Bible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LIVING ROOM

               PAUL, opening the book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK, as Paul opens it. It's a newspaper 
               clipping as is almost all of what follows. A small article: 
               simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes.

               PAUL turns the page. This headline reads: "Investment Banker 
               Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall."

               "USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall." That's the headline 
               on the next page.

               Now: "Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate."

               Paul turns the page.

               Manchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: "Ernest Gonyar, 79, 
               Dies After Long Illness."

               Now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--"after 
               long illness" is from the next article. "Long illness" from 
               the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation: 
               "Short Illness."

               Now we're in Pennsylvania: "New Hospital Staff Announced."

               And here come those phrases again on page after page--"After 
               Long Illness." "After Long Illness."

               "After Long Illness."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states 
               keep changing, moving west. Pennsylvania to Minnesota, 
               Minnesota to North Dakota. And always the clippings reporting 
               deaths and deaths and--

               --and now we're in Colorado. "NEW HEAD MATERNITY NURSE NAMED." 
               And now the dead are young and helpless; babies. More and 
               more of them.

                                     PAUL
                              (stunned)
                         Holy shit.

               Then a headline which reads:

               "HEAD MATERNITY NURSE QUESTIONED ON INFANT DEATHS"

               Next page: "MISS WILKES RELEASED."

               Next page: "THREE MORE INFANTS DIE."

               Next page, at last: "DRAGON LADY ARRESTED."

               Then a photo: the front page of the Rocky Mountain Gazette. 
               Annie on the courthouse steps. "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE," 
               under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes.

               Paul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline:

               "DRAGON LADY FOUND NOT GUILTY"

               PAUL just sits there, shaking his head in bewilderment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BOOK, as Paul turns the LAST page.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stunned and now we find out why, as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAGE IN THE BOOK. It's an article from Newsweek magazine, 
               a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow. 
               Above it this caption: "Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Slamming the book shut, putting it back on the coffee 
               table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, steering his wheelchair toward the front door. He tries 
               to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he 
               can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too 
               cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his 
               room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles 
               into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his 
               chest and stares up at the ceiling.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL'S WINDOW, hours later. The rain has stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--trying to stay awake. After a few beats, he hears 
               something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP.

               HEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL 
               grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of 
               a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS.

               As the FRONT DOOR OPENS, PAUL girds himself for attack. THE 
               FRONT DOOR CLOSES, then a couple of FOOTSTEPS. Then silence. 
               Then the FOOTSTEPS continue down the hall and up the stairs.

               After a beat, we hear the TELEVISION. Someone is explaining 
               how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate 
               with no money down.

               PAUL, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the 
               mattress. As the TV DRONES ON, Paul lies staring up at the 
               ceiling.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

               We hear a clap of THUNDER and once again the rain pours down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE UP: PAUL--eyes closed. There is another loud THUNDERCLAP 
               which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes.

               He turns his head and another CLAP OF THUNDER is heard, 
               LIGHTNING flashes and reveals ANNIE standing over his bed.

               Before he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls 
               it out and starts out of the room.

               PAUL tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes 
               him to collapse, unconscious.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM. EARLY MORNING.

               It's stopped raining, PAUL lies asleep. Now, surprisingly, 
               we hear a VOICE we've never heard in the movie before--loud--
               for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: 
               It's LIBERACE talking to his audience on a record going, 
               "Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me 
               to be back with you in Paris..." PAUL stirs and awakens to 
               discover that he is strapped to his bed. He can move his 
               arms, but that's it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, standing in the room, and she looks very together; 
               her eyes are bright. Too bright. Way too bright.

               She comes to the foot of his bed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, groggy from being drugged, tries to clear the cobwebs.

                                     ANNIE
                              (in a soft voice)
                         Paul, I know you've been out.

                                     PAUL
                         What?

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been out of your room.

                                     PAUL
                         No, I haven't.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, my little ceramic penguin in 
                         the study always faces due south.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

               PAUL looks up at her--he is totally honest and sincere. As 
               he talks, his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the 
               mattress edge.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, as she brings the fat-hand led knife out of her skirt 
               pocket.

                                     ANNIE
                         Is this what you're looking for? I 
                         know you've been out twice, Paul. At 
                         first, I couldn't figure out how you 
                         did it, but last night I found your 
                         key.
                              (She holds up the 
                              bobby pin)
                         I know I left  my scrapbook out, and 
                         I can imagine what you might be 
                         thinking of me. But you see, Paul, 
                         it's all okay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed.

               And now a THUMP comes from the foot of the bed. Something is 
               out of sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at her; waiting.

                                     ANNIE
                         Last night it came so clear. I realize 
                         you just need more time. Eventually, 
                         you'll come to accept the idea of 
                         being here. Paul, do you know about 
                         the early days at the Kimberly Diamond 
                         Mine? Do you know what they did to 
                         the native workers who stole diamonds? 
                         Don't worry, they didn't kill them. 
                         That would be like junking a Mercedes 
                         just because it had a broken spring--
                         no, if they caught them they had to 
                         make sure they could go on working, 
                         but they also had to make sure they 
                         could never run away. The operation 
                         was called hobbling.

               And with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up 
               holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, whatever you're thinking about, 
                         don't do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just 
               above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't fuss, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would I run away? I'm a writer, 
                         Annie--it's all I am--and I've never 
                         written this well--even you said 
                         that this is my best, didn't you?

               ANNIE picks up a sledgehammer.

                                     PAUL
                         Didn't you? Why would I leave a place 
                         where I'm doing my best work? It 
                         doesn't make any sense.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, positioning herself to the side of his right ankle.

                                     ANNIE
                         Shh, darling, trust me--
                              (taking aim at his 
                              ankle)
                         It's for the best.

               She takes the sledgehammer back.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, for God's sake, please.

               As ANNIE swings, the sledgehammer makes contact with the 
               ankle. It breaks with a sharp CRACK.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP, shrieking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, moving to the other side of the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Almost done, just one more.

               And as she breaks the other ankle, PAUL shrieks even louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP.

                                     ANNIE
                         God, I love you...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S FACE. He is beyond agony.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               For a long moment, nothing.

               Then... a FAINT SOUND. After a moment, it begins to become 
               more intrusive and we can tell what it is: a car horn HONKING.

               FADE IN ON:

               SILVER CREEK and ANNIE in her Cherokee, HONKING for another 
               car to get a move on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HAND AND A COIN MOVING ACROSS IT, from finger to finger.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               BUSTER, sitting by the front window of his office, reading 
               The Rocky Mountain Gazette.

               He watches idly as ANNIE yells out the window to the car in 
               front of her. THE DRIVER of the car yells back. Annie yells 
               louder. The Driver guns off, and Annie pulls into the parking 
               space next to the General Store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting out, shaking a fist at the other car, calling 
               out, "You poop!" She enters the store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, staring straight ahead. Something is gnawing at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, in his office, tidying the desk. BUSTER enters, 
               looks angry.

                                     BUSTER
                         Just leave it, all right?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Oh, I like that tone.

                                     BUSTER
                         How many times do I have to tell you--
                         I have a system here.
                              (rooting through a 
                              pile of papers)
                         Where the hell is that thing?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What thing?

                                     BUSTER
                         That thing.
                              (finding what he's 
                              looking for, a 3 x 5 
                              card)
                         Here it is. Right where it's supposed 
                         to be.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What is it?

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         It's good you found it.

                                     BUSTER
                         There's that spice again.

               As BUSTER leaves, VIRGINIA goes back to tidying the desk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LIBRARY STACKS

               BUSTER, wearing bifocals, sits poring over bound volumes of 
               The Rocky Mountain Gazette.

               BUSTER, tense, adjusting his bifocals.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SERIES OF HEADLINES pertaining to Annie Wilkes' murder 
               trial.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HEADLINE which reads, "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE."

               Under a PICTURE OF ANNIE on the courthouse steps, we see a 
               CAPTION: "Wilkes told reporters on the courthouse steps, 
               'There is a higher justice than that of man; I will be judged 
               by Him.'"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, sitting there, staring at the quote.

               ANNIE, carrying a bag of feed, followed by MISERY, the sow, 
               comes into view. She slows, smiles, waves--

                                     ANNIE
                         Hi, Punkin.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Give us a smile?

                              finger. She laughs)
                         Such a kidder.

               As she exits our view--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lifting the typewriter and repeatedly raising it over 
               his head, this time without any difficulty.

               THE GENERAL STORE IN SILVER CREEK. EARLY AFTERNOON.

               BUSTER enters. The place is empty. It's one of those wonderful 
               spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like 
               complete disarray. Buster goes to the coffee urn behind the 
               counter, helps himself. He speaks to the guy who sits behind 
               the counter nearby; these two have known each other forever.

                                     BUSTER
                         Hey, Pete.

                         If I can.

                         Do you have any of those new Paul 
                         Sheldon books?

                         We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three 
                         days.

                         You wouldn't happen to remember if 
                         Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?

                                     PETE
                         Are you kidding? Every time that 
                         fella writes a book, she makes me 
                         set aside the first copy.

               BUSTER opens the cash register, drops his coffee money inside, 
               closes the register.

                                     BUSTER
                         Has she been buying any odd things 
                         lately?

                         that.

               ANNIE, entering Paul's room. He lies back in the wheelchair, 
               eyes closed. Liberace music playing in the background. From 
               the start, PAUL'S TONE is different--strong, he's in control.

                         Paul, don't you think it's time for 
                         you to start writing again? It's 
                         been over a week.

                         I don't know, it's weird, but a couple 
                         of broken bones hasn't done a lot 
                         for my creative juices. Get the fuck 
                         out of here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               ANNIE, busily making cocoa.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER IN HIS CAR. He stops at a mailbox. The name on the 
               box is WILKES. Buster turns his car slowly into the driveway 
               by the mailbox.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He yawns, opens his eyes briefly. Closes them. In the 
               distance now, growing more and more visible is Buster's car--

               --and now PAUL'S EYES go open wide, and he's staring out the 
               window at the car as it keeps on coming, closer, closer and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, looking around. He's driving very slowly, carefully.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Fixating on the window and now it's all going to be 
               all right, everything's going to be all right--

               --and then ANNIE is on him, hypodermic needle in hand, jabbing 
               it into his arm. He desperately tries to fight her off, but 
               the drug starts to take hold. He tries to grab her by the 
               neck, but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the 
               room, down the hall and towards the cellar door.

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't think I'll ever understand 
                         you. I cook your meals, I tend to 
                         you practically twenty-four hours a 
                         day, and you continue to fight me. 
                         When are we going to develop a sense 
                         of trust?

               ANNIE opens the cellar door. PAUL is all but limp by now. As 
               she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER pulling up in front of the house. As he gets out of 
               his car--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE placing Paul on the cellar floor and heading up the 
               stairs. PAUL is out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER heading up the steps to the front door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE stashing the wheelchair in the hall closet. She crosses 
               to the front door, opens it, revealing BUSTER.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Gasping)
                         Oh, my!

                                     BUSTER
                         Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. 
                         You didn't give me a chance to knock.

                                     ANNIE
                              (all charm)
                         Guess you can tell from my reaction, 
                         I'm not all that used to visitors 
                         out here. What can I do for you?

                                     BUSTER
                         I was just wondering if you happen 
                         to know anything about Paul Sheldon.

                                     ANNIE
                              (stammering)
                         What do you want to know?

                                     BUSTER
                         Anything you can tell me might help.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. The words pour out--

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, he was born in Worcester, 
                         Massachusetts, forty-two years ago, 
                         the only child of Franklin and Helene 
                         Sheldon, mediocre student, majored 
                         in history...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, watching her, surprised.

                                     BUSTER
                              (cutting in)
                         Excuse me, that's not exactly the 
                         kind of information I was after. You 
                         see, he's been missing for quite 
                         some time now, and...

                                     ANNIE
                         I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his 
                         number-one fan...I've got all his 
                         books, every sentence he ever put 
                         down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon 
                         collection...
                              (stops suddenly, almost 
                              embarrassed)
                         ...here I am, prattling on and my 
                         manners have just flown away. I 
                         haven't invited you in. Please.

                                     BUSTER
                         Thank you.

               ANNIE lets BUSTER in, closes the door. They linger in front 
               of Paul's door. Buster idly checks out the hallway.

                                     ANNIE
                         'Course you must know about that 
                         horrible accident.

               BUSTER nods and wanders into the living room. ANNIE follows. 
               He crosses into the study and checks out a bookcase that 
               contains the complete works of Paul Sheldon. One shelf below 
               contains Annie's infamous scrapbook.

                                     ANNIE
                         Almost killed me, too. I prayed when 
                         I heard the news. I got down on my 
                         knees and begged for it not to be 
                         true.

               CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She's so moved. Buster wanders into the kitchen.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're going to laugh at what I'm 
                         about to say, but go ahead, I don't 
                         care...
                              (beat)
                         ...when I was praying, God told me 
                         to get ready.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, watching her. This isn't at all what he expected.

                                     BUSTER
                         Get ready for what?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to fight the drug; just his eyes flutter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE and BUSTER heading back down the hallway toward Paul's 
               room.

                                     ANNIE
                         To try and be his replacement--he 
                         gave so much pleasure to so many 
                         people and there's a shortage of 
                         pleasure on this planet these days, 
                         in case you hadn't noticed.

               BUSTER enters Paul's room. ANNIE follows.

                                     ANNIE
                         God told me, since I was his number-
                         one fan, that I should make up new 
                         stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. 
                         So, went to town. And I bought a 
                         typewriter. And paper to type on. 
                         The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And 
                         I turned the guest bedroom into a 
                         writing studio. Would you like to 
                         see it?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sure.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's right this way.

               BUSTER takes a look in the bathroom. ANNIE waits for him.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's right here. I knew how he wrote, 
                         the kinds of words he used, the 
                         wonderful stories he told--
                              (moved)
                         --I've spent the last four weeks 
                         trying to write like Paul Sheldon.
                              (sad shake of the 
                              head)
                         But I can't do it right. I try and I 
                         try and I know all the words--
                              (eyes closed in despair)
                         --but it's just not the same.

               BUSTER. He just stands there, watches her.

                         Well...
                              (long pause)
                         ...maybe it takes time to get the 
                         hang of it.

                              from the manuscript)
                         I could give you a couple of hundred 
                         pages of mine, and you could tell me 
                         what you think.

                         I'm not much of a critic.

                         Well, I just thought--oh, look at 
                         me. You'd think I'd never had a house 
                         guest before. Would you like something 
                         to drink?

                         How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?

                         Sounds good.

               As she exits into the kitchen.

                         There's some already made.

               BUSTER lingers in Paul's room for a beat, then goes into the 
               hallway.

                         Must get lonely, living out here all

                         I always say if you can't enjoy your 
                         own company, you're not fit company 
                         for anyone else.

                         You got a point there...

               As Buster moves up the stairs--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still fighting the drug. His arm twitches almost 
               involuntarily, grazing the barbecue.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER opening the door to Annie's room. He looks around and 
               just as he is about to turn to leave--

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Here you are.

               BUSTER heads down the stairs, ANNIE follows.

                                     BUSTER
                         Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want 
                         to take up any more of your time. I 
                         best be going.

                         But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

               They cross to the front door.

                         I'm sure it's wonderful, but really 
                         should be getting back.

               BUSTER opens the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL stirring.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER and ANNIE at the door.

                                     BUSTER
                         If you don't mind, perhaps I could 
                         pay you another visit sometime.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'd be delighted. Now that you know 
                         the way...

               With that, she closes the door. We stay with BUSTER. He stands 
               on the front porch for a beat, thinking, then starts heading 
               down the porch steps. Just as he reaches about halfway down, 
               we HEAR A LOUD CRASH coming from inside the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--he has managed to partially fight his way through the 
               drug, and in waking has accidentally knocked over the 
               barbecue. He fights to clear the cobwebs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     BUSTER
                         Miz Wilkes, are you all right?

               There is no answer. He quietly moves into the house.

                                     BUSTER
                         Miz Wilkes?

               Again, no answer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still fighting to gain complete consciousness.

                                     PAUL
                              (weakly)
                         Here. I'm down here. Down here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the 
               sound to the cellar door. As PAUL continues to call out, 
               Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door. 
               The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul, 
               who is still lying on the floor.

                                     BUSTER
                         Mr. Sheldon?

               But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a LOUD 
               EXPLOSION. Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through 
               Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, 
               smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar 
               steps.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't feel bad, Paul. It had to 
                         happen. I've been waiting for this 
                         sign.

               ANNIE walks toward BUSTER'S BODY and very casually takes his 
               gun out of its holster.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've known for some time why I was 
                         chosen to save you. You and I were 
                         meant to be together forever. But 
                         now our time in this world must end. 
                         But don't worry, Paul. I've already 
                         prepared for what must be done. I 
                         put two bullets in my gun, one for 
                         you and one for me. Oh, darling, it 
                         will be so beautiful.

               With that, ANNIE turns and exits the cellar.

               Paul's mind races desperately. He looks at the barbecue again. 
               Next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on 
               it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TABLE. One of the cans is LIGHTER FLUID.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He stares at it for a moment. An idea hits him--

               --now, PAUL struggles and crawls over to the table. He grabs 
               the lighter fluid in his hands, jams it into the rear of his 
               pants and scrambles back to where ANNIE left him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE returning with her .38 Special and a hypodermic needle. 
               She stops at the top of the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't be afraid. I love you.

               She starts toward him.

                                     PAUL
                         I know you do. I love you too, Annie.
                              (this stops her)
                         And you're right. We are meant to be 
                         together. And I know we must die. 
                         But it must be so that Misery can 
                         live. We have the power to give Misery 
                         eternal life. We must finish the 
                         book.

                                     ANNIE
                         But the time is now. Soon others 
                         will come.

                                     PAUL
                         It's almost done. By dawn we'll be 
                         able to give Misery back to the world.

               ANNIE stares at Paul. She could go either way on this. Then, 
               without a word, she turns and goes back up the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here, Paul. I'll fix you something 
                         to eat.

               She exits. PAUL hesitates for a moment, then realizes he has 
               no choice. He starts dragging himself over BUSTER and up the 
               stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               PAUL working. Typing like a madman, totally concentrated on 
               the white paper. His lips move but he's not even aware of 
               it.

               ANNIE enters quietly, holding a few pages.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.

                                     PAUL
                         Three more chapters to go.

               She looks at him now, enthralled.

                                     ANNIE
                         The stranger staying at the Inn, is 
                         he someone from Misery's past?

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe.

                                     ANNIE
                         This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, 
                         her first love, right?

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe. Are you ready for the next 
                         chapter?

               He taunts her with it.

                                     ANNIE
                              (brimming with 
                              enthusiasm)
                         Oh you!

               She takes the pages and goes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. LATER.

               PAUL types a moment then rips out the page and starts over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, putting the coffee down for him, putting the pages 
               back on the main pile.

                                     ANNIE
                              (more excited now 
                              than the last time)
                         It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what 
                         does that do to her love for Ian?--
                              (thinks)
                         --of course, if she hadn't thought 
                         Windthorne was murdered she never 
                         would have fallen in love with Ian 
                         in the first place.
                              (Paul glares at her, 
                              she turns to the 
                              door)
                         Sorry, it's just that this is so 
                         wonderful.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm glad you like it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, this will be our legacy.

                                     PAUL
                         It will.

               He hands her a few more pages, she starts reading as she 
               exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. MUCH LATER.

               PAUL rubs his eyes. For a moment, he sags, but he fights it. 
               He puts a clean page into the typewriter.

               ANNIE bursts in.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind 
                         up with Ian or Windthorne? You have 
                         to tell me.

                                     PAUL
                         You'll know very soon. I'm starting 
                         the last chapter. And when I finish, 
                         I want everything to be perfect. 
                         I'll require three things.

                                     ANNIE
                         What things?

                                     PAUL
                         You don't know?

                                     ANNIE
                              (smiling)
                         I was fooling, silly.
                              (ticking them off)
                         You need a cigarette, because you 
                         used to smoke but you quit except 
                         when you finish a book, and you just 
                         have one, and the match is to light 
                         it. And you need one glass of 
                         champagne.
                              (thinks)
                         Dome Pear-igg-non.

                                     PAUL
                         Dome Pear-igg-non it is.

               AS ANNIE exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW

               The first light of morning is starting to break through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stretching. He makes sure everything is set.

                                     PAUL
                              (calling out)
                         Annie! Annie!

               With that, she enters.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm almost done.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian 
                         and Windthorne dueling for the right 
                         to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, 
                         don't me. It's Windthorne, right?

                                     PAUL
                         You'll know everything in a minute. 
                         Get the champagne.

                                     ANNIE
                              (dying from the 
                              suspense)
                         Ahh!!!

               She exits; PAUL adjusts the manuscript on the table and then 
               types the last line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE IN THE KITCHEN. She takes the bottle of Dom Perignon 
               out of the icebox, places it on a tray with two glasses--
               opens a drawer--takes out the gun--places it in her pocket--
               then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the 
               tray.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               ANNIE enters with the tray. She sets it down on the table.

                                     ANNIE
                         Did I do good?

                                     PAUL
                         You did perfect. Except for one thing. 
                         This time we need two glasses.

               He takes the last page out of the typewriter.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul.

               As soon as she exits, PAUL drops the manuscript to the floor, 
               pulls the lighter fluid from his pants, and starts dousing 
               the manuscript with lighter fluid. He grabs the last chapter 
               and twists the last few pages together torch style. He douses 
               it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight.

               He smiles as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE entering with the second glass...

                                     PAUL
                         It's all right here, Annie. Remember 
                         how for all those years no one ever 
                         knew who Misery's real father was, 
                         or if they'd ever be reunited? It's 
                         all right here. Will Misery finally 
                         lead her countrymen to freedom? Does 
                         she finally marry Ian or will it be 
                         Windthorne? It's all right here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MATCH, as he strikes it and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE screaming--

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, you can't.

               And as her hands fly out beseechingly--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE--it falls to the floor, explodes like a 
               torpedo, shards of glass all over, curds of foam everywhere--

                                     PAUL
                         Why not? I learned it from you...

               And on that--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LAST CHAPTER as Paul brings the match close to it and it 
               bursts into flame. And Paul, holding it like the torch it 
               is. Annie starts moving forward now.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no, NOT MISERY--NOT MY MISERY...!

               He drops the last chapter into the soaked manuscript and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MANUSCRIPT, as KABOOM!, it bursts into flame and--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, transfixed by the sight for a moment,

               --and then she charges.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FIRE as ANNIE rushes to the book, stoops down, grabs it 
               with both hands, brings the burning mass up to her body, 
               both arms across it, trying to smother the flames--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing the typewriter, raising it high above his 
               head, then throwing it down on her with all his power and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER, crashing into the back of her head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, screaming, driven to the floor by the blow, the book 
               beneath her, and the flames fly up, her sweater is starting 
               to burn and she's covered with shards of glass from the 
               shattered bottle of champagne and some of the manuscript is 
               hissing from the liquid, but she is able to struggle to her 
               knees--

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm going to kill you, you lying 
                         cocksucker...

               As she struggles to her feet, she pulls out the gun and shoots 
               at Paul, hitting him in the shoulder. Just as she's about to 
               shoot again, Paul quickly wheels the chair up to her, throws 
               himself out of the chair, and tackles her. The gun flies out 
               of her hand and lands in the hallway, going off as it lands. 
               They wrestle on the floor.

               Flames still around them, PAUL gets on top of her, grabs 
               some burning pages, stuffs them into her mouth, shouting --

                                     PAUL
                         Here. Here. You want it? You want 
                         it? You can eat it--eat it--eat it 
                         till you fucking CHOKE--you sick, 
                         twisted fuck.

               And as he forces more paper into her mouth--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, and she's hideous--blistered, her hands claw at her 
               throat. She makes horrible sounds, spitting the charred chunks 
               of manuscript out of her mouth. Shards of glass are in her 
               hair. Now a shriek and a tremendous jerk of her body and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, falling away --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, still making the sounds as she gets to her feet, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to crawl away after her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE--heading for the door, she takes a step away from Paul, 
               then another, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, suddenly kicking out with his shattered leg, screaming 
               in pain as it crashes into her ankle and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, trying to keep her balance, not doing well, her arms 
               windmilling as she fights for balance one last moment, fights 
               and loses, and now, as she topples over--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER as she falls and her head slams into it, 
               collides with the sharp metal and a great wound opens in her 
               head. There is one final cry. Blood pours. It's over. All 
               over. We are looking at a dead body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, exhausted, panting, lying there, trying to gather his 
               energy. He starts to crawl for the door. Just as he reaches 
               the doorjamb, an arm grabs his leg, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, shrieking, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, pulling herself up his body and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to buck her off, but he can't and

               ANNIE, the stronger, relentless, moving up on him, and

               PAUL, his grip broken as he turns and

               ANNIE, swelling, and the blood pours down and if she feels 
               his blows she doesn't show it and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, whatever energy he has left he uses now, trying to 
               twist and strike and as his body moves--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               METAL BASED FLOOR LAMP and

               PAUL, grabbing the thing, suddenly bringing it across his 
               body, clobbering Annie in the face and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, startled by the power of the blow and for a moment 
               she is stopped and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as with everything he has left, he crunches her forehead 
               with the sharp heavy metal base, just creams her as the air 
               is forced out of her--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. Her eyes roll up into her head. For a moment all we 
               see are the whites--

               --then she collapses on PAUL, a motionless mountain of slack 
               flesh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, scrambling free, pushing her off him, crawling for the 
               door--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               --outside the door, as PAUL crawls into view, makes it to 
               the corridor, reaches back, closes the door, locks it.

               Safe, he collapses, exhausted against the wall opposite the 
               door.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL. HOURS LATER. It is dawn. He is awakened by a loud 
               smashing at the front door. After a couple of heart-stopping 
               pounds,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FRONT DOOR smashes open, revealing two cops with guns 
               drawn.

               THE POLICEMEN, hurrying to PAUL. The YOUNGER COP kneels beside 
               Paul.

                                     YOUNGER COP
                         It's the writer--the dead one--

                                     PAUL
                              (trying to keep himself 
                              together)
                         --right! I'm the dead one--

                         Where's Sheriff McCain?

                                     PAUL
                         He's in the cellar. She killed him.

                                     OLDER COP
                         Annie Wilkes?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah. She's in there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The OLDER COP, taking the key to the room, unlocks the door, 
               throws it open, and as he steps inside--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE BEDROOM

               The OLDER COP has his gun ready to fire, but even with it 
               tight in his hand, he's edgy as hell.

               He looks around--

               --glass and bloodstains on the floor. The charred remains of 
               a manuscript.

               He kneels quickly, glances under the bed--nothing.

               He looks at the window--wide open.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL and the YOUNGER COP. Pause. The OLDER COP is in the 
               doorway now.

                         Mr. Sheldon? There's no one in there.

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. In shock.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PALM COURT, PLAZA HOTEL

               This legend appears: ONE YEAR LATER

               MARCIA SINDELL is seated at a table. PAUL enters, walking 
               briskly, and he's never looked this good before. He's gained 
               his weight back, his color is normal again. He appears to 
               be, for the first time in the movie, a jaunty, happy figure.

                                     PAUL
                         Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball 
                         game went into overtime. If anybody 
                         ever told me I'd have a daughter 
                         who'd get a triple double, I'd...

                         Did they win?

                         Yeah. They're in the semis.

                         Here it is.
                              (big moment)
                         Very first copy.

               And she hands him a wrapped package. PAUL sits, begins 
               unwrapping it. It's a book. A new one by Paul Sheldon. The 
               Higher Education of J. Phillip Stone. Paul turns it over 
               gently in his hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         The word I'm getting is the Times 
                         review is gonna be a love letter.

                                     PAUL
                         That'd be a first.

                                     SINDELL
                         And my contacts at Time and Newsweek 
                         tell me they're both raves. And don't 
                         laugh--for the first time, I think 
                         you've got a shot at some prizes.

                                     PAUL
                              (flatly)
                         Great.

                                     SINDELL
                         I thought you'd be thrilled. You're 
                         being taken seriously.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm delighted the critics are liking 
                         it, and I hope the people like it, 
                         too. But it's not why I wrote the 
                         book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. There is a genuine sense of peace about him. 
               He has been through the fire and survived.

                                     PAUL
                         I like it. Remember how you once 
                         said I live my whole life as if I'm 
                         in danger of being found out? Well, 
                         I believe I've managed to get that 
                         guy down on paper.
                              (He touches the book. 
                              Beat.)
                         Don't think I'm completely nuts, but 
                         in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole 
                         experience, helped me.

                                     SINDELL
                         Paul, since you brought her up, I 
                         have to ask you this, or I'd be 
                         drummed out of the agents' union--
                         what about a non-fiction book? The 
                         truth about what went on in that 
                         house.

                                     PAUL
                         Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you 
                         better, I'd think you were suggesting 
                         I dredge up the worst horror of my 
                         life just so we could make a few 
                         bucks.

                                     SINDELL
                         Now you've hurt me, Paul.

               As Paul glances around...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking past MARCIA.

               DESSERT TROLLEY, some distance away, being pushed by a 
               waitress. It is ANNIE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I thought you were over it.

                                     PAUL
                         I am. Well, maybe not completely--

               He glances toward the trolley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DESSERT TROLLEY, moving inexorably closer to PAUL. ANNIE 
               reaches down and pulls out a very sharp knife.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND SINDELL

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know if you can ever be 
                         totally over something like that--I 
                         just don't think about it as much 
                         anymore, and when I do, it's not so 
                         terrifying.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, with the knife raised.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring up at ANNIE.

                                     PAUL
                         I mean, once they found her body, my 
                         nightmares stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE--only it isn't Annie, just a WAITRESS. She 
               stands by the trolley, the knife in her hand, ready to slice 
               whatever anyone wants.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Would you care for anything?

                                     PAUL
                              (smiles)
                         Cut me something sinful...

               PAUL. The smile holds. In the background now, soft music: 
               someone might be playing "Liberace."

               HOLD ON PAUL

                                                            FINAL FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
"MISERY"

                                            by

                                     William Goldman

                                  Based on the Novel by

                                       Stephen King

                

               FADE IN ON:

               A SINGLE CIGARETTE. A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a 
               bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of 
               the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. 
               There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND--

               --now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really 
               a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western 
               themed.

               He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous 
               mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered 
               along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows 
               stronger--there could be a storm.

               PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he 
               continues to type.

               He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good 
               face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other 
               words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen 
               years and for half that time, the most recent half, a 
               remarkably successful one.

               He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a 
               hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another 
               burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the 
               table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words:

                                         THE END

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this 
               last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up, 
               folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of 
               pages.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he holds his book to him. He is, just for a brief 
               moment, moved.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SUITCASE across the room. PAUL goes to it, opens it and 
               pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather 
               briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the 
               briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, 
               and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a 
               child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself 
               a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match--
               there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales 
               deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles.

               HOLD BRIEFLY, then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LODGE - DAY

               PAUL--exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws 
               it, hitting a sign.

                                     PAUL
                         Still got it.

               He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and, 
               holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives 
               away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SIGN that reads "Silver Creek Lodge." Behind the sign is 
               the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes 
               out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign. As "Shotgun" 
               by Jr. Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the 
               mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY. Gun-metal grey. The clouds seem pregnant with snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving the Mustang, the battered briefcase on the 
               seat beside him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD AHEAD. Little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly 
               visible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR, going into a curve and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving, and as he comes out of the curve, a stunned 
               look hits his face as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD AHEAD--and here it comes--a mountain storm; it's as 
               if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning 
               whatsoever, we're into a blizzard and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, slowing, driving deeper into the mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, squinting ahead, windshield wipers on now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, rounding another curve, losing traction--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, a skilled driver, bringing the car easily under control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD

               Snow is piling up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL driving confidently, carefully. Now he reaches out, 
               ejects the tape, expertly turns it over, pushes it in and, 
               as the MUSIC continues, he hums along with it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY. Only you can't see it.

               There's nothing to see  but the unending snow, nothing to 
               hear but the wind which keeps getting wilder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD. Inches of snow on the ground now. This is desolate 
               and dangerous.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOW. Worse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD, curving sharply, drop ping. A sign reads: "Curved 
               Road, Next 13 Miles."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, coming into view, hitting the curve--no problem--
               no problem at all--and then suddenly, there is a very serious 
               problem and as the car skids out of control--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, doing his best, fighting the conditions and just as it 
               looks like he's got things going his way--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD, swerving down and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, all traction gone and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, helpless and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, skidding, skidding and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD as it drops more steeply away and the wind whips 
               the snow across and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG starting to spin and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MOUNTAINSIDE as the car skids off the road, careens down, 
               slams into a tree, bounces off, flips, lands upside down, 
               skids, stops finally, dead.

               HOLD ON THE CAR A MOMENT

               There is still the sound of the WIND, and there is still the 
               music coming from the tape, perhaps the only part of the car 
               left undamaged. Nothing moves inside. There is only the WIND 
               and the TAPE. The wind gets louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WRECK looked at from a distance. The MUSIC sounds are 
               only faintly heard.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE AREA WHERE THE WRECK IS--AS SEEN FROM THE ROAD. The car 
               is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WRECK from outside, and we're close to it now, with the 
               snow coming down ever harder--already bits of the car are 
               covered in white.

               CAMERA MOVES IN TO

               PAUL. He's inside and doing his best to fight is, but his 
               consciousness is going. He tries to keep his eyes open but 
               they're slits.

               Slowly, he manages to reach out with his left arm for his 
               briefcase--

               --and he clutches it to his battered body. The MUSIC continues 
               on.

               But PAUL is far from listening. His eyes flutter, flutter 
               again. Now they're starting to close.

               The man is dying.

               Motionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase.

               HOLD ON THE CASE. Then--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The BRIEFCASE in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk.

                                     SINDELL (O.S.)
                         What's that?

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               We are in New York City in the office of Paul's literary 
               agent, MARCIA SINDELL. The walls of the large room are 
               absolutely crammed with book and movie posters, in English 
               and all other kinds of other languages, all of them featuring 
               the character of MISERY CHASTAIN, a perfectly beautiful woman. 
               Misery's Challenge, Misery's Triumph--eight of them. All 
               written by Paul Sheldon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lifting up the battered briefcase--maybe when new it 
               cost two bucks, but he treats it like gold.

                                     PAUL
                         An old friend. I was rummaging through 
                         a closet and it was just sitting 
                         there. Like it was waiting for me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     SINDELL
                              (searching for a 
                              compliment)
                         It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... 
                         character.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TWO OF THEM

                                     PAUL
                         When I wrote my first book, I used 
                         to carry it around in this while I 
                         was looking for a publisher. That 
                         was a good book, Marcia. I was a 
                         writer then.

                                     SINDELL
                         You're still a writer.

                                     PAUL
                         I haven't been a writer since I got
                         into the Misery business--

                                     SINDELL
                              (holding up the cover 
                              art of MISERY'S CHILD)
                         Not a bad business. This thing would 
                         still be growing, too. The first 
                         printing order on Misery's Child was
                         the most ever--over a million.

                                     PAUL
                         Marcia, please.

                                     SINDELL
                         No, no. Misery Chastain put braces 
                         on your daughter's teeth and is 
                         putting her through college, bought 
                         you two houses and floor seats to 
                         the Knick games and what thanks does 
                         she get? You go and kill her.

                                     PAUL
                         Marcia, you know I started "Misery" 
                         on a lark. Do I look like a guy who 
                         writes romance novels? Do I sound 
                         like Danielle Steel? It was a one-
                         time shot and we got lucky. I never 
                         meant it to become my life. And if I 
                         hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd 
                         have ended up writing her forever.
                              (touches his briefcase)
                         For the first time in fifteen years, 
                         I think I'm really onto something 
                         here.

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really 
                         am. But you have to know--when your 
                         fans find out that you killed off 
                         their favorite heroine, they're not 
                         going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon 
                         can finally write what we've always 
                         wanted: An esoteric, semi-
                         autobiographical character study.

                                     PAUL
                              (passionately)
                         Marcia, why are you doing this to 
                         me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? 
                         Don't you think I remember how nobody 
                         gave a shit about my first books? 
                         You think I'm dying to go back to 
                         shouting in the wilderness?
                              (beat)
                         I'm doing this because I have to.
                              (Marcia is stopped)
                         Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try 
                         to finish this and I want your good 
                         thoughts--because if I can make it 
                         work ...
                              (beat)
                         I might just have something that I 
                         want on my tombstone.

               On the word "tombstone"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S TOMBSTONE--the upside down car with the blizzard coming 
               gale-force and his motionless body trapped inside the car.

               The WIND screams. PAUL'S EYES flutter, then close.

               Hold

               Keep holding as--

               Suddenly there's a new sound as a crowbar SCRATCHES at the 
               door--

               -- nd now the door is ripped open as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A BUNDLED-UP FIGURE gently beginning to pull PAUL and the 
               case from the car. For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a 
               man or woman--

               --not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is, 
               very much, a woman. Her name is ANNIE WILKES and she is close 
               to Paul's age. She is in many ways a remarkable creature. 
               Strong, self-sufficient, passionate in her likes and dislikes, 
               loves and hates.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE as she cradles him in her arms. Once he's 
               clear of the car, she lays him carefully in the snow

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE: CLOSE UP. She slowly brings her mouth down 
               close to his. Then their lips touch as she forces air inside 
               him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Their lips touch 
                              again. Then--)
                         You hear me--Breathe! I said 
                         breathe!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he starts to breathe--

               --in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide, but he's in shock, 
               the eyes see nothing--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE--the moment she sees him come to life, she goes into 
               action, lifting PAUL in a fireman's carry, starting the 
               difficult climb back up the steep hill.

               As she moves away, she and Paul are obliterated by the white 
               falling snow.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WHITE OF WHAT SEEMS LIKE A HOSPITAL. Everything is bled 
               of color. It's all vague--

               --we are looking at this from Paul's blurred vision.

               And throughout this next sequence, there are these SOUNDS, 
               words really, but they make no sense.

               "...no... worry...

               ...be... fine...

               ...good care... you...

               ...I'm your number one fan..."

               The first thing we see during this is something all white. 
               It takes a moment before we realize it's a ceiling.

               Now, a white wall.

               An I.V. bottle is next, the medicine dripping down a tube 
               into PAUL'S LEFT ARM. The other arm is bandaged and in a 
               sling.

               ANNIE is standing beside the bed. She wears off-white and 
               seems very much like a nurse. A good nurse. She has pills in 
               her hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Motionless, dead pale. He has a little beard now. Eyes 
               barely open, he's shaking with fever.

                                     PAUL
                              (hardly able to whisper)
                         ...where... am I...?

               ANNIE is quickly by his side.

                                     ANNIE
                              (so gently)
                         Shhh... we're just outside Silver 
                         Creek.

                                     PAUL
                         How long...?

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been here two days. You're 
                         gonna be okay.
                              (relieved)
                         My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--

                                     PAUL
                         --my number one fan.

               And now the gibberish words make sense.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's right. I'm also a nurse. Here.
                              (Now, as she brings 
                              the pills close)
                         Take these.

               She helps him to swallow, as Paul's eyes close.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               AN EXTERIOR OF THE PLACE. It's a farmhouse--we 're in a 
               desolate area with mountains in the background.

               THE HOUSE is set on a knoll so that Paul's room, although on 
               the first floor, is ten feet off the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, in the room. He's not on the I.V. anymore. His fever 
               has broken. Annie enters, pills in her hand.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here.

                                     PAUL
                         What are they...?

                                     ANNIE
                         They're called Novril--they're for 
                         your pain.
                              (helps him take them)

               ANNIE applies a cool rag to his forehead.

                                     PAUL
                         Shouldn't I be in a hospital?

                                     ANNIE
                         The  blizzard was too strong. I 
                         couldn't risk trying to get you there. 
                         I tried calling, but the phone lines 
                         are down.

               PAUL tries to test his left arm.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Gently, her fingers 
                              go to his eyelids, 
                              close them)
                         Now you mustn't tire yourself. You've 
                         got to rest, you almost died.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Sometimes her face shows the most remarkable 
               compassion. It does now.

               HOLD ON IT briefly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE UP ON PILLS IN ANNIE'S HAND

                                     ANNIE (O.S.)
                         Open wide.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               He lies in bed. His fever is gone, but he's terribly weak.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. As she lays the pills on PAUL'S TONGUE, she gives him 
               a glass of water from the nearby bed table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, swallowing eagerly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him, sympathetically.

                                     ANNIE
                         Your legs just sing grand opera when 
                         you move, don't they?
                              (Paul says nothing, 
                              but his pain is clear)
                         It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, 
                         I promise you.

                                     PAUL
                         Will I be able to walk?

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course you will. And your arm 
                         will be fine, too. Your shoulder was 
                         dislocated pretty badly, but I finally 
                         popped it back in there.
                              (proudly)
                         But what I'm most proud of is the 
                         work I did on those legs. Considering 
                         what I had around the house, I don't 
                         think there's a doctor who could 
                         have done any better.

               And now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his 
               body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S LEGS. From the knees down he resembles an Egyptian 
               mummy--she's splinted them with slim steel rods that look 
               like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and there's 
               taping circling around.

               From the kness up they're all swollen and throbbing and 
               horribly bruised and discolored.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lying back, stunned with disbelief.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's not nearly as bad as it looks. 
                         You have a compound fracture of the 
                         tibia in both legs, and the fibula 
                         in the left leg is fractured too. I 
                         could hear the bones moving, so it's 
                         best for your legs to remain immobile. 
                         And as soon as the roads open, I'll 
                         take you to a hospital.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP

                                     ANNIE
                         In the meantime, you've got a lot of 
                         recovering to do, and I consider it 
                         an honor that you'll do it in my 
                         home.

               HOLD on her ecstatic face.

               Then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MISERY'S PERFECT FACE. We're back in SINDELL's office in New 
               York. The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts 
               all over. But she doesn't.

               She holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure.

                                     SINDELL
                         This is Marcia Sindell calling from 
                         New York City. I'd like to speak to 
                         the Silver Creek Chief of Police or 
                         the Sheriff.

                                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Which one do you want?

                                     SINDELL
                         Whichever one's not busy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SMALL OFFICE IN SILVER CREEK

               ...with a view of the mountains.

               A MARVELOUS LOOKING MAN sits at a desk, by himself, holding 
               the phone. In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and 
               sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago. Never mind what his 
               name is, everyone calls him BUSTER.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm pretty sure they 're both not 
                         busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're 
                         both me. I also happen to be President 
                         of the Policeman's Benefit 
                         Association, Chairman of the 
                         Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if 
                         you need a good fishing guide, you 
                         could do a lot worse; call me Buster, 
                         everybody does, what can I do for 
                         you?

               SINDELL in her office. She pushes the speakerphone, gets up, 
               paces; she's very hesitant when she speaks about Paul. Almost 
               embarrassed--

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm a literary agent, and I feel 
                         like a fool calling you, but I think 
                         one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, 
                         might be in some kind of trouble.

                         Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon 
                         the writer?

                                     SINDELL
                         Yes.

                         He's your client, huh?

                                     SINDELL
                         Yes, he is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER'S OFFICE

               He rolls a penny across the back of one hand--he's very good 
               at it, doesn't even look while he does it.

                                     BUSTER
                         People sure like those Misery books.

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm sure you know Paul's been going 
                         to the Silver Creek Lodge for years 
                         to finish his books.

                         Yeah, I understand he's been up here 
                         the last six weeks.

                                     SINDELL
                         Not quite. I just called, and they 
                         said he checked out five days ago. 
                         Isn't that a little strange?

                                     BUSTER
                         I don't know. Does he always phone 
                         you when he checks out of hotels?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL, really embarrassed now.

                                     SINDELL
                         No, no, of course not. It's just 
                         that his daughter hasn't heard from 
                         him, and when he's got a book coming 
                         out, he usually keeps in touch. So 
                         when there was no word from him...

                                     BUSTER
                         You think he might be missing?

                              (shakes her head)
                         I hate that I made this call--tell 
                         me I'm being silly.

                         Just a little over-protective, maybe.

                         morning.

                              (gives her a hug)
                         Virginia? When was that blizzard?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Four or five days ago. Why?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. The penny flies across the back of his hand. He 
               doesn't look at it, stares instead out the window at the 
               mountains.

               PAUL'S ROOM

                                     PAUL'S VOICE
                              (soft)
                         I guess it was kind of a miracle... 
                         you finding me...

               ANNIE's soft, sweet laughter is heard. She stands over him, 
               finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor. She 
               wears what we will come to know as her regular costume--plain 
               wool skirts, grey cardigan sweaters.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in 
                         a way, I was following you.

                                     PAUL
                         Following me?

               ANNIE concentrates on shaving him with great care; she has 
               wonderful, strong hands.

                                     ANNIE
                              (explaining, normally)
                         Well, it wasn't any secret to me 
                         that you were staying at the Silver 
                         Creek, seeing as how I'm your number-
                         one fan and all. Some nights I'd 
                         just tool on down there, sit outside 
                         and look up at the light in your 
                         cabin--
                              (gently moves his 
                              head back, exposing 
                              his neck; this next 
                              is said with total 
                              sincerity, almost 
                              awe)
                         and I'd try to imagine what was going 
                         on in the room of the world's greatest 
                         writer.

                                     PAUL
                         Say that last part again, I didn't 
                         quite hear--

                              (smiles)
                         Don't move now--wouldn't want to 
                         hurt this neck--
                              (shaving away)
                         Well, the other afternoon I was on 
                         my way home, and there you were, 
                         leaving the Lodge, and I wondered 
                         why a literary genius would go for a 
                         drive when there was a big storm 
                         coming.

                                     PAUL
                         I didn't know it was going to be a 
                         big storm.

                                     ANNIE
                         Lucky for you, I did.
                              (pauses)
                         Lucky for me too. Because now you're 
                         alive and you can write more books. 
                         Oh, Paul, I've read everything of 
                         Yours, but the Misery novels...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I know them all by heart, Paul, all 
                         eight of them. I love them so.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking at her. There's something terribly touching 
               about her now.

                         You're very kind...

                         And you're very brilliant, and you 
                         must be a good man, or you could 
                         never have created such a wondrous, 
                         loving creature as Misery Chastain.

                              the last bits of

               ANNIE starts cleaning up.

                                     PAUL
                         When do you think the phone lines'll 
                         be back up? I have to call my 
                         daughter, and I should call New York 
                         and let my agent know I'm breathing.

                                     ANNIE
                         It shouldn't be too much longer.
                              (gently)
                         Once the roads are open, the lines'll 
                         be up in no time. If you give me 
                         their numbers, I'll keep trying them 
                         for you.
                              (suddenly almost 
                              embarrassed)
                         Could I ask you a favor?
                              (Paul nods)
                         I noticed in your case there was a 
                         new Paul Sheldon book and...
                              (hesitant)
                         and I wondered if maybe...
                              (her voice trails off)

                                     PAUL
                         You want to read it?

                                     ANNIE
                              (quietly)

                         I have a hard and fast rule about 
                         who can read my stuff at this early 
                         stage--only my editor, my agent, and 
                         anyone who saves me from freezing to 
                         death in a car wreck.

                         Boy, it's like clockwork, the way 
                         your pain comes--I'll get you your

                         away and making you feel all oogy.

                         I mean I haven't written anything 
                         but "Misery" for so long that--you 
                         read it you can tell me what you 
                         think it's about. Maybe you can come

                         things to be out of the ordinary.

                                     PAUL
                         I can take it, go ahead.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, it's brilliantly written, but 
                         then everything you write is 
                         brilliant.

                                     PAUL
                         Pretty rough so far.

                                     ANNIE
                              (a burst)
                         The swearing, Paul.
                              (beat)
                         There, I said it.

                                     PAUL
                         The profanity bothers you?

                                     ANNIE
                         It has no nobility.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, these are slum kids, I was a 
                         slum kid, everybody talks like that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She holds the soup bowl in one hand, the muddy-colored 
               beef barley soup close to spilling.

                                     ANNIE
                         They do not. What do you think I say 
                         when I go to the feed store in town?
                         "Now, Wally, give me a bag of that 
                         effing pigfeed and ten pounds of 
                         that bitchly cow-corn"--

               PAUL is amused by this.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SOUP, almost spilling as she gets more agitated.

                                     ANNIE
                         --and in the bank do I tell Mrs. 
                         Bollinger, "Here's one big bastard 
                         of a check, give me some of your 
                         Christing money."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, almost laughing as some soup hits the coverlet.

                                     ANNIE
                              (seeing the spill, 
                              suddenly upset)
                         There! Look there! See what you made 
                         me do!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--his smile disappears.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, and she is just totally embarrassed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
                         Sometimes I get so worked up. Can 
                         you ever forgive me? Here...

               She hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the 
               coverlet. Then she makes the sweetest smile.

                                     ANNIE
                         I love you, Paul.
                              (more embarrassed 
                              than ever)
                         Your mind. Your creativity--that's 
                         all I meant.

               Flustered, she turns away as we--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS. Piles of snow all around but it's 
               been ploughed enough so it's driveable.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A CAR coming into view. Up ahead is the sign we've already 
               seen: "Curved Road, Next 13 Miles."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE CAR

               BUSTER AND HIS WIFE VIRGINIA: Virginia is driving while Buster 
               intently studies the terrain. He reaches for a large thermos, 
               pours some coffee, offers it to her. She shakes her head. He 
               begins to sip it.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         This sure is fun.

               She puts her hand on his leg.

                                     BUSTER
                              (removing it)
                         Virginia, when you're in this car, 
                         you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Well, this deputy would rather be 
                         home under the covers with the 
                         Sheriff.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR. Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights 
               it back under control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE CAR

                                     BUSTER
                              (suddenly)
                         Stop--stop right here.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What? What is it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR, skidding, slowing, stopping. BOTH OF THEM get out, 
               go to the edge of the road. Mountains of snow. Nothing much 
               else visible. Then Buster points.

                                     BUSTER
                         Look at that broken branch there...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, seeing it, unconvinced.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Could be the weight of the snow.

                                     BUSTER
                         Could be--or a rotten branch or a 
                         mountain lion could have landed on 
                         it. Could be a lot of things.

               He steps off the road, starts down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, watching him, worried--it's very slippery.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TREE that the car ran into. BUSTER reaches it, studies 
               it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, staring out after him--she can't see him because 
               the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds 
               of snow.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Anything down there?

                                     BUSTER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yeah. An enormous amount of snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where 
               the Mustang is buried.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MOUND OF SNOW with the Mustang inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, making his way closer to it, closer, staring around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE AREA. Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with 
               mountains of snow. You could have a house down there and not 
               be able to see it. Just glaring white.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, angry, frustrated, turning around and around and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER from another angle, from behind the mound with the 
               Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun, 
               a bit of the door protrudes. But, of course, Buster can't 
               see it.

               HOLD ON BUSTER, in a sour mood, staring around as the edge 
               of the door continues to glisten.

               CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still 
               ticked.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (they move to the car)
                         You really think Sheldon's out there?

                                     BUSTER
                         Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's 
                         go to the newspaper office.

               As they get in the car--

               ANOTHER CAR DRIVING BY--it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she 
               nor Buster notice each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               The door opens and ANNIE enters.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake 
                         you.

                                     PAUL
                         It's fine.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               Paul's eyes fluttering awake to see the hardback copy of his 
               novel, Misery's Child, in Annie's hands. She's never been 
               more excited--

                                     ANNIE
                         They had it at the store, Paul, there 
                         was a whole batch of them there. As 
                         soon as I saw it, I slammed my money
                         down. I got the first copy.

                                     PAUL
                         Then the roads are open...

                                     ANNIE
                         The one to town is, but that's about 
                         it. I called the hospital and talked 
                         to the head orthopedic surgeon. I 
                         told him who you were and what had 
                         happened. He said as long as there's 
                         no infection, you're not in any 
                         danger, and as soon as the road to 
                         the hospital is open, they'll send 
                         an ambulance for you.

                                     PAUL
                         The phones are working?

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, mine's still out. But the ones 
                         in town were working just fine. I 
                         called that agent of yours.
                              (soft now)
                         Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very 
                         beginning.
                              (looks at him)
                         What a wonderful first page--just to 
                         read the name Misery Chastain...

                                     PAUL
                         My daughter must be going nuts.

                                     ANNIE
                         ...it's like a visit from my oldest,
                         dearest friend.

                                     PAUL
                         I was supposed to be home for her 
                         birthday three days ago.

                                     ANNIE
                         Your agent said she would tell her 
                         you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll 
                         have to wait until tomorrow if you 
                         want to speak to her yourself.

               She starts to leave, stops at the door.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She looks at him now 
                              with almost a look 
                              of amazement)
                         Oh, Paul, what a poet you are...

               As she leaves--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL, watching as she enters, moves to him, carrying a tray.

                                     ANNIE
                         I made you my speciality--scrambled 
                         eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 
                         75.

                                     PAUL
                         I guess that means it's okay.

                                     ANNIE
                         No. No, it isn't, it's--
                              (halts)
                         --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. 
                         Would "great" be insulting?

                                     PAUL
                         I can live with "great."

               He starts, with effort, to eat.

                                     ANNIE
                              (as she turns, goes)
                         No, it's not just great, it's perfect, 
                         a perfect, perfect thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. MID-AFTERNOON

               ANNIE is clearing Paul's tray. She hands him his Novril; he 
               quickly swallows them.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm up to page 185. I always get sad 
                         when I pass the halfway point. Will 
                         you do me a favor? I'd love it if 
                         you would autograph my copy. I already 
                         have your autograph on a picture, 
                         but it would mean so much to me to 
                         get it in person. I know you're right-
                         handed, so don't worry if it's not 
                         so legible. I'll cherish it anyway.

               As PAUL signs the book:

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't mean to pry, but I've read 
                         in two magazines now where you were 
                         seeing this model who does those 
                         disgusting jeans commercials. And I 
                         said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon 
                         would never waste his time with a 
                         trampy woman like that.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, you can't believe everything 
                         you read in magazines.

                                     ANNIE
                         I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. 
                         Boy, how do they get away with 
                         printing stuff like that?

                                     PAUL
                         You'd be amazed at what some people 
                         will believe.

               He finishes the autograph, hands the book back to her.

                                     ANNIE
                         Thank you so much.

                                     PAUL
                         My pleasure.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WINDOW - LATE - AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR. IT opens and guess what--a sow lumbers in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, kind of stunned as this female pig skitters its way 
               around the room, excited, confused, slipping and sliding.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, all smiles and happiness, laughing in the doorway.

                                     ANNIE
                         I thought it was time you two should 
                         meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite 
                         beast in all the world, my sow, 
                         Misery.

                                     PAUL
                         Misery?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PIG, snorting around the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE, watching it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes. I told you I was your number-
                         one fan.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm getting to believe you.

                                     ANNIE
                         This farm was getting kind of dreary, 
                         what with just the few cows and 
                         chickens and me--
                              (happy)
                         But when I got Misery here, everything 
                         Changed--she just makes me smile so.

                                     PAUL
                         She's a fine... uh... pig is what 
                         she is...

                                     ANNIE
                              (scooping up the pig, 
                              holding it tight as 
                              she stands by Paul)
                         I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, 
                         and it's better than perfect--it's 
                         divine. What's the ceiling that dago 
                         painted?

                                     PAUL
                         The Sistine Chapel?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those 
                         are the only two divine things ever 
                         in this world...

               PAUL watches as the pig skitters out of the room with ANNIE 
               in pursuit, happily imitating the pig.

                                     ANNIE
                         Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL staring after them--what the hell was that?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW. DUSK.

               ANNIE'S VOICE is heard softly.

                                     ANNIE
                         When my husband left me... I wasn't 
                         prepared, it wasn't an easy time...

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               ANNIE, standing at the window, her back to the room.

               In bed, PAUL is dealing with a bedpan, peeing.

                                     ANNIE
                         For a while I thought I might go 
                         crazy.

                                     PAUL
                         I know how that can be.

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't know about you, but what I 
                         did to get through it was I dove 
                         into work--days, nights--night shifts 
                         can be lonely at a hospital. I did a 
                         lot of reading. That was hen I first 
                         discovered Misery. She made me so 
                         happy. She made me forget all my 
                         problems.
                              (She smiles now)
                         'Course, I suppose you had a little 
                         something to do with that too.

               There is a peeing sound.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, well...

               He is embarrassed.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She isn't)
                         I just kept reading them over and 
                         over. I know when I finish this one--
                         and I've only got two chapters to go--
                         I'll just turn right to the front 
                         page and start reading it again.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm...

                                     ANNIE
                              (She turns around, 
                              moves to the bed)
                         Done?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, thanks.

                                     ANNIE
                         No problem.

               As she takes the bedpan...

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't get me wrong. I'm not against 
                         marriage per se. But it would take a 
                         pretty special guy to make me want 
                         to go down the aisle again.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, it's not something you should
                         enter into lightly.

                                     ANNIE
                         It boils down to respect. People 
                         just don't respect the institution 
                         of marriage any more. They have no 
                         sense of real commitment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, attempting to smile. There is not much he can say to 
               this.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'd love to stay here and chat, but 
                         I'm right at the end and I gotta 
                         find out what happens.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I hope you like it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course I'll like it. Misery's 
                         about to have her child. What's it 
                         gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't 
                         tell me.

               With that, she exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He's been dozing but now his eyes flutter awake as we

               THE DOOR. It opens and ANNIE enters, comes to his bedside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Hard to see. He squints up as we

               ANNIE. CLOSE UP: her face is ashen pale.

                                     ANNIE
                         You...you dirty bird. She can't be 
                         dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! 
                         How could you?

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, in 1871, women often died in 
                         childbirth, but her spirit is the 
                         important thing, and Misery's spirit 
                         is still alive--

                                     ANNIE
                              (screaming)
                         I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER!
                         And you MURDERED her!

                                     PAUL
                         I DIDN'T...

                                     ANNIE
                         Then who did?

                                     PAUL
                         No one--she just died--she slipped 
                         away, that's all.

                                     ANNIE
                              (screaming)
                         She slipped away? She slipped away? 
                         She didn't just slip away. You did 
                         it. You did it. You did it. You did 
                         it. You murdered my Misery.

               And now she has lifted a chair--it's heavy but she's very 
               strong--and she raises it and turns on Paul, and it's high 
               above her head, and PAUL realizes that this might be it, she 
               might shatter him with it, crunch his skull--and that's just 
               what she seems she's about to do--and then she swings it, 
               not against him but against the wall, and it shatters and 
               she's panting from the effort as she turns on him again, her 
               voice surprisingly soft.

                                     ANNIE
                         I thought you were good, Paul, but 
                         you're not good, you're just another 
                         lying old dirty birdie and I don't 
                         think I better be around you for 
                         awhile.
                              (she crosses to the 
                              door, then stops)
                         And don't even think about anybody 
                         coming for you, not the doctors, not 
                         your agent, not your family--because 
                         I never called them. Nobody knows 
                         you're here. And you better hope 
                         nothing happens to me because if I 
                         die, you die.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, watching as she closes the door behind her. Then there 
               is a RATTLE OF A KEY and the sound of the door to his room 
               LOCKING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting in her Cherokee and gunning away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM

               PAUL lies still. He looks around the room and listens for 
               sounds. All he hears are the SOUNDS OF A WINTER NIGHT in the 
               mountains. After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and 
               then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body 
               out of bed, to make it move.

               He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the 
               main thing: it's the pain. Any attempt at movement and his 
               legs scream. He sags back, lies there still a moment. Slowly 
               he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. He rolls over 
               onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor 
               by moving down head first. His good arm hits the floor, and 
               he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way 
               to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds 
               himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to 
               the floor.

               The pain is excruciating. After he regains his composure, he 
               slowly crawls toward the door.

               He reaches up and tries the handle. It is, in fact, locked. 
               He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is 
               much too painful and to no avail. He crawls back over to the 
               bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs

               the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes 
               his eyes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BUSTER'S OFFICE. DAY.

               He sits alone at his desk on the telephone, staring at the 
               Rocky Mountain Gazette spread in front of him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE NEWSPAPER'S FRONT PAGE

               In a prominent spot on the top is what is most likely a book-
               jacket photo of Paul. Above the picture is the following: 
               "HAVE YOU SEEN PAUL SHELDON?"

               BUSTER is on the phone with Marcia Sindell.

                                     BUSTER
                         No, Ms. Sindell, there's no point in 
                         coming up here now. Everything that 
                         can be done is... Yes, we're working 
                         closely with the state police, and 
                         the FBI has been informed. Right... 
                         Right... As soon as we know anything 
                         we'll let you know. No, it's no 
                         bother. Call anytime. Bye, Ms. 
                         Sindell.

               VIRGINIA enters, carrying some files.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Here's the list of all Sheldon's 
                         credit charges. Nothing after the 
                         Silver Creek.
                              (With a glance at his 
                              dour face, she 
                              indicates the photo)
                         Any calls?

                                     BUSTER
                         Just from his agent.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. His eyes flick up to her. An almost imperceptible 
               shake of the head.

               HOLD FOR A MOMENT, then--

               FACES. They are distorted, and they come into view but 
               briefly, then change into the next distorted face. All kinds-- 
               there is no order to them

               --young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so 
               pretty, happy, white, old--what we HEAR is this:

               "...You've changed my life..."

               "...I'm your number one fan..."

               "...I'm a really big fan of yours..."

               "...I'm your biggest fan..."

               "...Don't ever stop writing those Misery books..."

               "...I've read all your books, but the Misery's... well..."

               "...I'm your number one fan..."

               "...You've given me such pleasure..."

               "...I feel like you're writing just for me..."

               And now, it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster, 
               many times overlapping.

               "...I love you... I'm your number one fan... I'm your biggest 
               fan... We love you... number one... love you... biggest... 
               love you... number one... number one... you poor dear 
               thing..."

               This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, 
               she stays that way--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM, AS IT SNAPS BACK INTO FOCUS--ANNIE is standing by 
               the bed. It is dusk.

               She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers. 
               Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the 
               prettiest ANNIE WILKES has ever looked.

                                     ANNIE
                         What are you doing on the floor?
                              (crossing to the bed)
                         It's my fault. If I'd had a proper 
                         hospital bed, this never would have 
                         happened. Here, let me help you back 
                         in.
                              (She lifts him back 
                              into the bed, which 
                              causes considerable 
                              pain)
                         I know this hurts, but it'll only 
                         take a few seconds. There you go. 
                         Comfy?

                                     PAUL
                              (in pain)
                         Perfect.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're such a kidder. I have a big 
                         surprise for you. But first there's
                         something you must do.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't suppose I could have a little 
                         snack while I wait for the
                         surprise?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'll get you everything you want, 
                         but you must listen first. Sometimes 
                         my thinking is a little muddy, I 
                         accept that. It's why I couldn't 
                         remember all those things they were 
                         asking me on the witness stand in 
                         Denver.

               Now she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking. She 
               is never out of sight.

                                     ANNIE
                         But this time I thought clearly. I 
                         asked God about you and God said "I 
                         delivered him unto you so that you 
                         may show him the way."

                                     PAUL
                         Show me the way?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes.

               She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed. 
               It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for 
               cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a 
               box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter 
               fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE AND PAUL. He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, 
               puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the 
               charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is 
               close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match.

                                     PAUL
                         When I mentioned a snack, I was 
                         thinking more along the lines of a
                         cheese and crackers kind of thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, looking at him.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, this is no time for jokes. You 
                         must rid the world of this filth.

               She hands him the box of kitchen matches.

                                     PAUL
                         You want me to burn my book?

                                     ANNIE
                              (she nods)
                         Yes.

                                     PAUL
                         You want me to burn my book?

                                     ANNIE
                         I know this may be difficult for 
                         you, but it's for the best.

                                     PAUL
                         This isn't difficult, my agent's 
                         made dozens of copies. There's gonna 
                         be an auction on this, and every 
                         publishing house in New York is 
                         reading it now. So if you want me to 
                         burn it, fine. You're not ridding 
                         the world of anything.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (quietly)
                         Then light the match, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         No big deal.

                                     ANNIE
                         So you've indicated. Do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MATCHES. PAUL'S HANDS are starting to tremble now. He 
               can't do it.

                                     ANNIE
                         I know this is the only copy, Paul. 
                         When you were twenty-four you wrote 
                         your first book and you didn't make 
                         a copy, because you didn't think 
                         anybody would take it seriously. But 
                         they did. And ever since you've never 
                         made any copies because you're 
                         superstitious--it's why you always 
                         come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. 
                         You told that story to Merv Griffin 
                         eleven years ago.

                                     PAUL
                         You know, Annie, this book never 
                         would have survived without you. 
                         When it gets to new York, there will 
                         be a big auction, and whatever it 
                         brings we can split.
                              (pause)
                         God knows you're entitled to it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. 
                         It's about decency and purity. It's 
                         about God's values.

                                     PAUL
                         You're right. You're right. I don't 
                         know what I was thinking. I'll tell 
                         you what. It doesn't have to be 
                         published. Nobody ever has to see 
                         it. I'll just keep it for myself. No 
                         one will ever have to know it exists.

                                     ANNIE
                         As long as it does exist, your mind 
                         won't ever be free. I think you should 
                         light the match, Paul.

               There is a long silence. PAUL doesn't move.

                                     ANNIE
                         Can't you see it's what God wants?

               She's holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she 
               speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on 
               the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're so brilliant. I would think 
                         you'd certainly be able to see that.
                              (More drops fall on 
                              the bed)
                         We're put on this earth to help 
                         people, Paul. Like I'm trying to 
                         help you.

               PAUL watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Please let me help you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. His hands shaking. Almost robot-like, he strikes one. 
               It flames.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're doing the right thing, Paul.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE, as Paul's hand appears, drops the match on the 
               fluid-soaked manuscript. For a moment--nothing--

               --and then, KABOOM, the goddamn thing practically explodes 
               and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring, dazed, and as the flames leap higher,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, suddenly scared and startled at the heat and the size 
               of the flames and the full baking heat and

                                     ANNIE
                              (crying out)
                         Goodness!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE. The sound is LOUDER as the flames leap up and 
               now charred bits of paper begin floating upward and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching, as more bits of paper rise.

                                     ANNIE
                         Goodness--Goodness--Oh, my gracious--

               And she starts trying to catch them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PIECE OF BURNING PAPER in midair, floating against the 
               gauzy curtain, and for a moment it looks like the curtain 
               will catch fire and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, panicked, racing out of the room, going "Goodness, 
               heavens to Betsy"--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE, and what's left of the book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and he cannot take his eyes off the disaster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, hurrying back in, carrying a big bucket, slopping 
               water as she lifts the bucket.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LAST of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed 
               onto it--there's hissing and steam and as the steam clears 
               it all looks now like a log in a brackish pond.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

               As she starts to wheel the barbecue out, suddenly there is a 
               new and different sound as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, head turning toward the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE taking  a step toward the window, stopping for a moment. 
               The sound we're hearing is a motor. A HELICOPTER MOTOR. And 
               it's getting louder. Annie goes to the window now, looks 
               toward the sky as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HELICOPTER flying along.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

               BUSTER and a PILOT are in the machine. Buster has a pair of 
               binoculars looped around his neck, a map rumpled in his lap.

                                     BUSTER
                              (pointing out)
                         That's the Steadman place up there.
                              (The pilot nods. Buster 
                              points again)
                         The only other place up here is the 
                         Wilkes farm.

               Another nod. The PILOT points down. BUSTER stares through 
               the binoculars.

               WHAT HE SEES: ANNIE'S JEEP parked in front of her house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

                                     BUSTER
                         That's no '65 Mustang. There's nothing 
                         else out this way--circle on back.

               As the pilot starts to change direction

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE at the window, watching, as the helicopter turns, starts 
               off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, listening as the MOTOR sound recedes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, staring out the window.

                                     ANNIE
                         I do believe the winters are getting 
                         shorter and shorter every year. People 
                         say it has something to do with the 
                         ozone layer. What do you think?

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's 
                         your Novril.
                              (she wheels the 
                              barbecue to the door; 
                              stops)
                         How does tuna casserole sound for 
                         dinner?

                                     PAUL
                         Great.

               She exits. PAUL takes the two Novril, stares at them, then 
               deliberately tucks them under his mattress.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               As PAUL is finishing the last of his tuna casserole. There 
               are two Novrils on his tray. We hear strains of TV GAME SHOW 
               THEME MUSIC. These sounds are not surprising. Paul has heard 
               them before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               It is much smaller than Paul's and filled with religious 
               bric-a-brac, pictures of Paul Sheldon, and a TV on a portable 
               stand. Annie lies in bed, with an open bag of Cheetos resting 
               on her stomach and a big quart-sized plastic bottle of Coke 
               on the nightstand. As she munches away, she is heavily 
               engrossed in her favorite TV show, "The Love Connection." As 
               Chuck Woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couple's 
               romantic interlude, we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Paul faintly hearing the sounds of the TV. He has now finished 
               eating. He takes the two Novril from under the mattress. He 
               then undoes the sheet, takes his fork and delicately pokes a 
               hole in the mattress, then stuffs all four pills back into 
               the hole.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FARMHOUSE

               Coming up to dawn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S DOOR slowly opening.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at  the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               WHEELS, seen from underneath the bed, being rolled around 
               the foot of the bed. We realize PAUL is in a wheelchair with 
               ANNIE pushing him.

                                     ANNIE
                         See, isn't this nice?

                                     PAUL
                         Great. I've always wanted to visit 
                         the other side of the room.

                                     ANNIE
                         And look what I've got for you. An 
                         electric razor so you can shave 
                         yourself now.

                                     PAUL
                         If I knew this was gonna be the 
                         surprise, you could've gotten me to
                         burn all my books.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She hands him some 
                              Novril)
                         Now don't josh. This is a very big 
                         day for you, Paul. Here. You just 
                         sit tight, and I'll set everything 
                         up.

               ANNIE exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, quickly shoving the Novril into the mattress.

                                     PAUL
                         Set what up?

                                     ANNIE
                         That's the big surprise. Your new 
                         studio--after all, writers do need a 
                         place to work.

                                     PAUL
                         Work? You mean write? What in the 
                         world do you think I'd write?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, but Paul!
                              (flushed)
                         I don't think, I know! Now that you've 
                         gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, 
                         you can go back to doing what you're 
                         great at--
                              (beat)
                         --you're going to write a new novel-- 
                         your greatest achievement ever--
                         Misery's Return.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Stunned.

                                     PAUL
                              (after a beat)
                         Misery's Return?

                                     ANNIE
                         I know you didn't mean it when you 
                         killed her, and now you'll make it 
                         right.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. In an almost religious fervor.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes. It will be a book in my honor. 
                         For saving your life and nursing you 
                         back to health. I'll be the first 
                         one to read it.
                              (beat)
                         Oh, Paul, you're going to make me 
                         the envy of the whole world...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     PAUL
                         You just expect me to whip something 
                         off, that it?

                                     ANNIE
                              (nods)
                         I expect nothing less than your 
                         masterpiece.

                                     PAUL
                         You do understand that this isn't 
                         the ordinary way books get written--
                         I mean, some people might actually 
                         consider this an oddball situation.

               She rolls him over to a table she has set up by the window.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have total confidence in your 
                         brilliance--besides, the view will
                         inspire you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW, as the wheelchair approaches it.

               The sky is innocent of clouds. There's a green forest climbing 
               the flank of the nearest mountain. A plot of open ground 
               between the house and the mountain. A neat red barn where 
               the livestock stay. A Jeep Cherokee, maybe five years old. A 
               Fisher plow. And no neighbors in sight. This is a desolate 
               place.

                                     ANNIE
                         You just inhale that. I'll be right 
                         back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              (calling out)
                         I guess you don't get bothered by
                         neighbors much.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't worry about that. You'll have 
                         total solitude so you can concentrate 
                         on your work.

                                     PAUL
                         Great.

               ANNIE in the doorway, carrying reams of typing paper, pencils, 
               pens and sharpener.

               PAUL, watching her--it's all kind of amazing. She hands him 
               a box of typing paper.

                                     ANNIE
                         I got you this expensive paper to 
                         type on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking at the paper. It's Corrasable Bond. An idea 
               hits him; he masks it as best he can.

                                     ANNIE
                              (putting the rest of

                         And I got a great deal on this fifty-
                         pound clunker--on account of it's 
                         missing an "n." I told the saleslady 
                         "n" was one of the letters in my 
                         favorite writer's name.

                                     PAUL
                         It's two of the letters in my favorite 
                         nurse's name, Annie.

                                     ANNIE
                              (embarrassed, blushing)

                              pencils, paper)
                         Did I do good?

                         You did great, except there's just 
                         one little thing--I can't work with 
                         this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it 
                         smudges. Maybe you could go back 
                         into town and bring me some white, 
                         long-grained mimeo.

                                     ANNIE
                         But mine cost the most so I don't 
                         see how it could smudge.

                                     PAUL

                         C'mere, I'll show you.

               As she approaches, he rubs his thumb over the pencil mark.

                              (looking at it)
                         Well, it does smudge after all--isn't 
                         that fascinating?

                                     PAUL
                         I thought you'd be interested. I'd 
                         like you to be in on everything, 
                         Annie. Not just the finished book, 
                         but how it's written.

                                     ANNIE
                         Thank you for thinking of me.
                              (She can be so charming 
                              when she wants)
                         Anything else I can get while I'm in 
                         town? Any other crucial requirements 
                         that need satisfying? Would you like 
                         a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a 
                         handmade set of writing slippers?

                                     PAUL
                         No, just the paper will be fine.

                              (suddenly very agitated)
                         Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, 
                         I'll bring back the whole store for 
                         you.

                         Annie, what's the matter?

                                     ANNIE
                         What's the matter? I'll tell you 
                         what's the matter. I go out of my 
                         way for you. I do everything to try 
                         and make you happy. I feed you, I 
                         clean you, I dress you. And what 
                         thanks do I get? "You bought the 
                         wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on 
                         this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get 
                         your stupid paper, but you just better 
                         start showing me a little more 
                         appreciation around here, Mister 
                         Man.

               With that, she throws the ream of paper in PAUL'S LAP, causing 
               considerable pain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as she slams it shut, locks it, stomps off and

               THE WINDOW. Annie, in a parka, can be seen storming out in 
               the direction where her Cherokee was parked. She gets in and 
               drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He heaves a sigh, reaches out toward his tortured knees, 
               then drops his head. He sees something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BOBBY PIN on the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he moves toward the bobby pin. Or tries to. It's 
               brutally hard for him. The chair moves half a foot. Stops. 
               Paul strains again. Another half foot. Another.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The BOBBY PIN. The wheelchair is beside it now. PAUL reaches 
               down for it. Can't make it. Tries again. Can't. He takes a 
               deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain. The 
               bobby pin is in his hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to 
               jimmy the lock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LOCK--it makes a SOUND--something has caught.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing 
               great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor 
               again.

                                     PAUL
                              (furious)
                         Shit...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BOBBY PIN. Paul reaches for it. The pain has him. He 
               reaches again, involuntarily cries out. But he grabs it, 
               clutches it tight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYHOLE. Paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time.

               No luck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. In wild frustration.

                                     PAUL
                         You've written how to do this--now 
                         do it!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYHOLE. There is a loud CLICKING sound.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as Paul turns the knob. The door opens a crack.

                                     PAUL
                              (amazed)
                         What do you know, it actually works.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because 
               in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up 
               to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it 
               out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's 
               wheels is an effort for him. He works at it and works at it, 
               but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally 
               he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone. 
               Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door, 
               tries it. It's locked from the outside.

                                     PAUL
                         What a surprise.

               He looks off into the living room, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TELEPHONE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, wheeling into the living room. Dark red predominates. 
               It's a musty room. Over the mantel, a photograph of a six-
               year-old ANNIE, with her mother and father in front of the 
               family car--a new 1952 Buick. These were happier times.

               The windows have bars on them.

               As PAUL begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PHONE as PAUL at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the 
               "operator" button--

                                     PAUL
                         Operator...
                              (nothing)
                         ...OPERATOR...
                              (wildly frustrated)
                         ...Shit!

               He shakes the phone. It's terribly light. He picks it up, 
               turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone. He 
               stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the 
               disappointment plain.

                                     PAUL
                         You crazy bitch...

               He puts the phone back on the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE GENERAL STORE. DAY.

               Annie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her 
               Cherokee and drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STUDY, as PAUL enters. He looks around.

               It's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots 
               of coffee tables covered with knickknacks. As he, with effort, 
               wheels across it--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A shelf of BOOKS. PAUL SHELDON books. EVERY Paul Sheldon 
               book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, pausing, looking at her collection. The only book on 
               the shelf that isn't his is a large scrapbook. The title on 
               the back reads "My Life."

               He glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair 
               across the study, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SMALL TABLE with little ceramic doodads on top. The 
               wheelchair his it, one of the doodads topples--it's a penguin, 
               fragile looking, and as it's about to fall to the floor and 
               shatter--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing for it, catching it, putting it back where it 
               was. He continues his slow way across the room and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HALLWAY.

               Out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, PAUL 
               notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly 
               it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the  
               house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but 
               canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke 
               containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he 
               notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees 
               all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of 
               strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and 
               stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry 
               door and heads to the kitchen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               As PAUL approaches it. He starts to wheel his way in, but he 
               has trouble.

               He backs up slightly, wheels forward again--

               --but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through. 
               He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BACK DOOR. It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to 
               the outside. It seems somehow less formidable than the front 
               door did. The windows around the kitchen are barred.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at the kitchen door--

               --then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower 
               himself out of the chair

               gently to the floor--

               --only it doesn't work that way. It's too awkward, he doesn't 
               have the strength to maneuver properly--

               --and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard 
               against the hard floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a 
               moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He 
               is hurting.

               He closes his eyes, gathering strength--

               --and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his 
               body across the floor toward the kitchen door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. It's still a long way away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body 
               move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Closer now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is 
               just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and 
               up and grabs the doorknob--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Locked solid.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his 
               face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting 
               from his effort. Then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his 
               wild excitement, as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               Sitting on the counter: A SET OF CARVING KNIVES sticking out 
               of a slotted wooden block.

               They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him. He 
               starts to crawl over to the counter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD

               ANNIE is driving along in her Cherokee. She is heading home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               Now at the counter, PAUL tries to pull himself up with his 
               one good arm, but even though he is able to chin himself up 
               to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the 
               knives. He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing 
               to the floor.

               As he starts to force his way up again--from outside there 
               comes a sound--the motor of a car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, driving up to the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               PAUL, throwing himself back to the floor, starting a wild 
               crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, getting out of her Jeep and

               KITCHEN

               PAUL, crawling, crawling and

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, walking around to the back of the Jeep and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KITCHEN

               PAUL, scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair, starting to 
               get it turned and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, opening the back of the Jeep and lifting out several 
               rectangular boxes of paper and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, straightened out now, forcing the wheelchair to move, 
               and now we're into a race, a crazed life-and-death race and 
               the cuts go fast--

               --and ANNIE closes the door of the car--

               --and PAUL is suddenly stuck, there's no traction on the rug--

               -- ow ANNIE, purchases in hand, starts away from the car for 
               the house--

               --and now PAUL is finally moving toward the bedroom.

               --and ANNIE is moving swiftly toward the front door.

               -- he drops one of the packages of paper.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still biting down, churning his arms with all the 
               strength he has left. PAUL'S ARMS, aching, start to turn to 
               rubber.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S FEET, walking quickly across the snow-covered area 
               in front of the house and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BEDROOM DOOR as Paul gets through it, shuts it, and 
               attacks the bedroom lock with the bobby pin and

               ANNIE, unlocking the front door of the house and

               THE BEDROOM DOOR, as it locks and

               THE FRONT DOOR, unlocking and

               ANNIE balancing the bundles under her chin as she jiggles 
               the key out of the front door lock and

               PAUL, soaked.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                              (her voice from the 
                              hallway, close and 
                              growing closer)
                         Paul, I've got your paper.

               PAUL. He wheels to exactly where he was when she left him. 
               He at last allows himself a sigh of relief.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as the sound of a lock CLICKING is heard.

                         Just the kind you asked for.

               And as the door opens--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--looking down. Paul's waistband--a half a dozen strips 
               of Novril ominously stick out.

               As the door swings open, he quickly covers the Novril with 
               this hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, in the doorway, a strange look on her face.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, you're dripping with 
                         perspiration, your color is very 
                         hectic--what have you been doing?

                                     PAUL
                         You know goddamn well what I've been 
                         doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE 
                         SUFFERING. I need my pills.

                                     ANNIE
                              (tenderly, as she 
                              starts toward him)
                         Poor dear... Let's get you back in 
                         bed and I'll get them for you.

                                     PAUL
                              (exploding--a real 
                              child's tantrum)
                         I want my pills NOW!

                                     ANNIE
                         It'll only take a second.

                                     PAUL
                         I want my pain to go 'way, Annie--
                         make it go 'way, please Annie--
                              (She looks at him--

               ANNIE. She stares a moment more, then turns, starts for the 
               door.

                              (upset)
                         It just breaks my heart to see you
                         like this...

               CUT TO:

               PAUL watching, and the instant she is out the door in the 
               hallway, he stuffs the Novril into his pants.

                                     ANNIE (O.S.)
                              (coming closer)
                         I've done a lot of thinking on the 
                         drive...

               ANNIE, entering the room, the Novril in her hand. She is 
               genuinely contrite.

                         ...and I'm absolutely convinced that 
                         the main reason I've never been more 
                         popular is because of my temper. You
                         must be so mad at me. The truth now.

               She hands him the pills. And rolls him over to the bed.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I don't  hold grudges. After 
                         all, who doesn't let off a little 
                         steam once in a while.

               PAUL putting the pills in his mouth, as she picks him up 
               from the chair and puts him gently down in bed.

                         writes.

               She hands him a pad and pencil.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here, in case you think of any ideas.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too 
                         much.

                         Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. 
                         Think of me as your inspiration.

                         ...my darling...

               On that she turns--for the first time, a coquettish look 
               comes to her face.

                                     ANNIE

                              kiss--it's grotesque)

               PAUL, summoning up all his courage, as he mimes catching it 
               and forces a smile on. She waves, closes the door.

               HOLD ON PAUL. The smile dies. He reaches in and pulls the 
               two Novril capsules out of his mouth. Now--

               Paul's Mustang that was revealed by the snow when Buster 
               almost found the car.

                         Walter, we could be skipping lunch 
                         today.

               Paul's car being hoisted by chains from the ground and, as

               THE AREA BY THE CAR--BUSTER is there and a bunch of STATE 
               POLICEMEN and various MEDIA PEOPLE are there--Buster stands 
               with the STATE POLICE CHIEF watching as the car is hoisted 
               via derrick; the sound of the powerful MOTOR lifting the car 
               is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher 
               and PEOPLE take pictures and stare and

               THE STATE POLICE CHIEF is addressing maybe a dozen REPORTERS. 
               It's very cold. BUSTER stands slightly away from the group.

                         The presumption must now be that 
                         Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he 
                         somehow crawled out of his car. But 
                         we have been unable to locate his 
                         body in the vicinity of the crash. 
                         We also know if anyone had found 
                         him, they would have taken him to an 
                         area hospital. His body is undoubtedly 
                         out there buried somewhere in the 
                         snow. We'll find him after the first 
                         thaw--unless the animals have gotten 
                         to him first.
                              (beat)
                         I'll take questions.

               After the first sentence, a very cold and very unhappy BUSTER 
               leaves the gathering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               crowbar.

               VIRGINIA moves to him now. They exchange a glance, start 
               walking together toward their car.

               THE CHIEF, surrounded--people are asking questions, raising 
               hands for attention, and as he answers them--

                         You don't think he's dead, do you?

                         He might well be. But not the way 
                         they say. He didn't crawl out of 
                         that car by himself. You saw those 
                         dents on the door--someone pulled 
                         him out.

                         It was an old car--those dents could 
                         have been there forever.

                                     BUSTER
                         There's two kinds of people that 
                         drive around in old cars: the ones 
                         that can't afford new ones, and the 
                         ones who wouldn't give 'em up for 
                         anything in the world. That second
                         bunch don't drive around with twenty-
                         five-year-old dents.

               As they drive off...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               PAUL lies in bed listening to the strains of "The Love 
               Connection," coming from upstairs. As Chuck Woolery drones 
               on, Paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper 
               from his pad. He is making a container of some sort. He 
               finishes, then reaches down and grabs the Novril capsules 
               that he has been stashing in the mattress.

               Carefully, he opens one and pours it into the palm of his 
               hand. First he smells it--no odor--then he takes a tiny bit 
               on a finger and tastes it--no taste. Then, he takes his paper 
               container and empties the contents of all the pills into it, 
               then places it under the mattress.

               Now, what to do with the empty capsules. He thinks for a 
               second, then--what the hell--he swallows them. He then places 
               the packet back in the mattress.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER. DAY.

               The window is visible behind it. From this angle, it almost 
               seems to be staring at PAUL, broken "n" and all. PAUL tests 
               his wounded arm. He's able to raise it a few inches, but 
               that's it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE is visible heading for the barn, followed by MISERY, 
               the pig. For a moment, she stops, turns to look back.

               Now, as she turns again, moves quickly away--

               PAUL, staring at the blank page. He takes a deep breath, 
               glances outside, then back to the paper.

               PAUL. He closes his eyes briefly, mutters something, kind of

               it in and starts mechanically to type.

                         I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, 
                         you'll have to do it over again.

                         What? What happened to "I'll treasure

                         it all out except for the part of 
                         naming that gravedigger after me. 
                         You can leave that in.

                         I really value your criticism, but 
                         maybe you're being a little hasty 
                         here.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, what you've written just isn't 
                         fair.

                                     PAUL
                         --not fair?

                                     ANNIE
                         That's right--when I was growing up 
                         in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in 
                         all the world was to go to the movies 
                         on Saturday afternoons for the chapter 
                         plays...

                                     PAUL
                              (it just comes out)
                         --cliff-hangers--

                                     ANNIE
                              (suddenly angry)
                         I know that, Mister Man--they also 
                         call them serials. I'm not stupid, 
                         you know.
                              (and she's a child 
                              again)
                         Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, 
                         and once it was a no-brakes chapter, 
                         the bad guys stuck him in a car on a 
                         mountain road and knocked him out 
                         and welded the doors shut and tore 
                         out the brakes and started him to 
                         his death and he woke up and tried 
                         to steer and tried to get out, but 
                         the car went off a cliff before he 
                         could escape and it crashed and burned 
                         and--I was so upset and excited and 
                         the next week you better believe I 
                         was first in line and they always 
                         start with the end of the last week 
                         and there was Rocket Man trying to 
                         get out, and here came the cliff and 
                         JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped 
                         free and all the kids cheered--
                              (standing up now)
                         --but I didn't cheer, I stood right 
                         up and started shouting, "This isn't 
                         what happened last week--have you 
                         all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED 
                         US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Still in her childhood reverie. Shouting:

                                     ANNIE
                         "HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE 
                         CAR!"

                                     PAUL
                         They always cheated like that in 
                         cliff--
                              (stops himself)
                         --chapter plays.

                                     ANNIE
                         But not you. Not with my Misery. 
                         Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary 
                         at the end of the last book, but his 
                         horse fell jumping that fence and 
                         Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs 
                         and lay there all night in the ditch 
                         so he never reached the doctor, so 
                         there couldn't have been any 
                         "experimental blood transfusion" 
                         that saved her life. Misery was buried 
                         in the ground at the end, Paul, so 
                         you'll have to start there.

               As she goes--

                                     PAUL
                         Look at this, I've got Lizzie Borden 
                         for an editor, here.

               PAUL slumps, staring barefully at the typewriter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NEXT MORNING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

               PAUL is at the table. He takes the Novril off his breakfast 
               tray, wheels over to the bed, and stuffs them into the 
               mattress. He hears FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. He smoothly 
               wheels back to the table. A pause.

               ANNIE enters to remove the tray.

                                     ANNIE
                         What's the matter, Paul? You haven't 
                         written a word.

                                     PAUL
                         I can't write this anymore.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't be silly. Of course you can.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm telling you, I can't.

                                     ANNIE
                         You can--you have the "gotta"--

                                     PAUL
                         The what?

                                     ANNIE
                         The "gotta." Remember, you talked 
                         about it in Playboy magazine. You 
                         said there's a million things you 
                         can't do in this world; you can't 
                         hit a curve ball, you can't fix a 
                         leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- 
                         but there's one thing you always 
                         have, and that's the power of the 
                         "gotta."

                                     PAUL
                         I said that?

                                     ANNIE
                         You said you can make it so they 
                         gotta turn the page. You know, "I 
                         'gotta' know will she live," "I
                         'gotta' know will he catch the 
                         killer." "I gotta see how this chapter 
                         ends." You said it. I don't usually 
                         buy that magazine. I only got it, 
                         'cause they were interviewing you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. Blinking.

                                     PAUL
                              (quietly)
                         What about a bee...?

                                     ANNIE
                         What?

                                     PAUL
                         Nothing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYBOARD as the piece of paper slides in and the keys  
               start to move. Annie stands there for a moment, then quietly 
               backs out of the room.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WINDOW. It's late afternoon.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               PAUL in the wheelchair watching as ANNIE finishes reading.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?

                                     ANNIE
                         You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian 
                         realized that the reason they'd buried 
                         Misery alive was because the bee 
                         sting had put her in that temporary 
                         coma--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, in a fervor.

                                     ANNIE
                         --and when Gravedigger Wilkes 
                         remembered how thirty years earlier, 
                         the same thing had happened to Lady 
                         Evelyn-Hyde--
                              (hands clasped)
                         --and then old Dr. Cleary deduced 
                         that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's 
                         long-lost daughter because of the 
                         rarity of deadly bee-stings--my heart 
                         just leapt.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, watching her. It's as if he had nothing to do with 
               anything she's read as she goes on.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've known from the very first book 
                         that Misery had to be born of nobility 
                         and I was right!

                                     PAUL
                              (mumbling  to himself)
                         Yeah, yeah...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TWO OF THEM; she touches the pages as if they were gold, 
               rubbing gently with the tips of her fingers.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter 
                         when you finish? I can fill in the 
                         "n"s.
                              (Paul nods, and she's 
                              off again)
                         Will she be her old self, now that 
                         Ian has dug her out, or will she 
                         have amnesia...?

                                     PAUL
                         ...have to wait.

                                     ANNIE
                         Will she still love him with that 
                         special perfect love?

                                     PAUL
                         Have to wait.

                                     ANNIE
                              (plead ing)
                         Not even a hint?

               Paul shakes his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, spinning around the room like a happy child.

                                     ANNIE
                         Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, 
                         it's so romantic--this whole house 
                         is going to be filled with romance. 
                         I'm going to put on my Liberace 
                         records--
                              (Stops, looks at Paul)
                         --you do like Liberace, don't you?

                                     PAUL
                              (quickly)
                         Whenever he played Radio City, who 
                         do you think was right there in the
                         front row?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm going to play my records all day

                                     LONG
                         --to inspire you--he's my all-time 
                         favorite.

               And with that, she starts to leave.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie?

               She stops at the door.

                                     PAUL
                         Would you have dinner with me tonight?

               She can't speak.

                                     PAUL
                         To celebrate Misery's return. I 
                         couldn't have done it without you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.

               ANNIE dashes excitedly out of the room. PAUL wheels over to 
               the bed, pulls the packet of Novril powder out from the 
               mattress and stuffs it in his pants. The sound of Liberace 
               playing "Tammy" with orchestra and chorus booms in from beyond 
               the door.

               BUSTER'S OFFICE. DUSK.

               VIRGINIA is on the phone.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (into phone)
                         No, he's not here. I don't know where 
                         he went. He never tells me anything 
                         anymore. He's probably out having an 
                         affair somewhere. Wait a minute. I 
                         think I hear him coming.

               BUSTER enters carrying a bagful of books.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (to Buster)
                         It's Jim Taylor. He wants to know 
                         who you've been having an affair 
                         with.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He puts the bag down, shoots Virginia a look and 
               grabs the phone. VIRGINIA looks in the bag.

                                     BUSTER
                         Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh-
                         huh... Jim, we've been over this. If 
                         you're gonna have benches in front 
                         of your store, people are gonna sit 
                         on them. I don't like him either, 
                         but I'm not going to come over there 
                         and tell him to move. Give my best 
                         to Denise. Bye.

                         Well, whoever she is, she sure likes 
                         to read a lot.

                                     BUSTER
                         Virginia, I'm flattered you think I 
                         got that much energy. I just figured 
                         if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at 
                         least I can find out what he wrote 
                         about.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What do you expect to find? A story 
                         about a guy who drove his car off a 
                         cliff in a snowstorm?

                         Now, you see, it's that kind of 
                         sarcasm that's given our marriage
                         real spice.

               STUDY. NIGHT.

               PAUL is sitting at a table that Annie has set up with her 
               best china and silverware. It is as romantic as Annie Wilkes 
               gets. ANNIE enters, carrying a basket of rolls. She sits and 
               serves Paul.

                                     ANNIE
                         I hope you like it.

                                     PAUL
                         It looks wonderful. And so do you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh...

               They eat in awkward silence. Finally:

                                     PAUL
                         I've never had meatloaf this good,
                         what do you do to it?

                                     ANNIE
                         My secret is I only use fresh 
                         tomatoes, never canned. And to give 
                         it that little extra zip, I mix in
                         some Spam with the ground beef.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh.
                              (pause)
                         You can't get this in a restaurant 
                         in New York.

               After another pause:

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, I think we should have a toast.

                                     ANNIE
                         A toast?

                                     PAUL
                         Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some
                         more wine.

               Paul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass.

                                     ANNIE
                         To Misery.

                                     PAUL
                         Wait, let's do this right. Do you 
                         have any candles?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll 
                         go look.

               She exits into the kitchen. PAUL quickly pulls the packet 
               filled with Novril powder from his pants. He empties it into 
               her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his 
               pants, talking the whole time:

                                     PAUL
                         Did you study decorating, or do you 
                         just have a flair?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, you. I just picked things up 
                         over the years.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, it certainly says you.

                                     ANNIE
                         You really think so?

                                     PAUL
                         Absolutely. Listen, if you can't 
                         find any, it's okay. I just thought
                         it might be nice.

               ANNIE re-enters with a candle.

                                     ANNIE
                         Are you kidding? If anyone ever told 
                         me that one day I'd be having a 
                         candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon 
                         in my own house, I woulda checked 
                         both legs to see which one was being 
                         pulled. Will this do?

                                     PAUL
                         It's perfect.

               She places the candle on the table. With a slight tremor in 
               her hand, she lights the candle. PAUL raises his glass.

                                     PAUL
                         To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who 
                         brought her back to life.

               ANNIE raises her glass.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, every time I think about 
                         it, I get goosebumps.

               They clink glasses.

               And with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, 
               she knocks over the candle. In trying to right the situation, 
               she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the 
               candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine.

                                     ANNIE
                              (wiping up the spilled 
                              wine with her napkin)
                         Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so 
                         sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful 
                         toast. Will you ever forgive me? 
                         Here, let me pour another one.
                              (she does)
                         Can we pretend this never happened? 
                         To Misery?

                                     PAUL
                         To Misery.

               So they drink their wine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The snow, although still present, has melted somewhat. And 
               starting now and continuing throughout is this: the sound of 
               typing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, the sling off, moving his injured arm. It's more mobile 
               than before. Testing his strength, he uses his arm to remove 
               the page and place it on the pile. He puts in another page 
               and continues to type.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Misery you've ever written.

                                     PAUL
                         I think you're right.

               once, sets it back down, puts the sling back on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I think it's so wonderful that Misery 
                         would sacrifice her title to take up 
                         the cause of her people. That's true 
                         nobility.

               Paul hands her some new pages. As she exits,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               His lips move silently. He's not even aware of it as he nods 
               and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAPER IN THE TYPEWRITER, line after line being written.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               Paul's face at DAY, NIGHT, and DUSK in rapid succession, 
               ending with

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

               Lightning! Giant deep rolls of THUNDER as RAIN begins...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TYPEWRITER being lifted out of frame, then back in, then out 
               again.

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               The pile of manuscript has doubled. Maybe two hundred pages.

               PAUL, with some effort, is pumping the typewriter up and 
               down. Finally, he places it back down and puts his arm back 
               in the sling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking outside breifly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE RAIN. Worse. The SOUND hit s the roof of the house, hits 
               the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, lumbering in--she's never looked like this: She's 
               wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat. Her 
               eyes are without life. Her hair, loose and straggly, hangs 
               around her face. Slowly, like a  robot, she goes to PAUL, 
               who looks silently up at her.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here's your pills.

               She drops them on the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as the pills hit his chest and bounce into his lap.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, what is it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE

                                     ANNIE
                              (half turns away, 
                              turns back, gestures 
                              outside)
                         The rain... sometimes it gives me 
                         the blues.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. And suddenly it's as if she's been turned 
               off, gone lifeless.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at her. No sound but the rain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, seen straight on. No light in her eyes.

                                     ANNIE
                         When you first came here, I only 
                         loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. 
                         But now I know I love the rest of 
                         him too. As much as Misery loves 
                         Ian.
                              (beat)
                         I know you don't love me--don't say 
                         you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, 
                         famous man of the world; and I'm...not 
                         a movie star type. You'll never know 
                         the fear of losing someone like you 
                         if you're someone like me.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would you lose me?

                                     ANNIE
                         The book is almost finished. Your 
                         legs are getting better. Soon you'll 
                         be able to walk. You'll be wanting
                         to leave.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would I want to leave? I like it
                         here.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's very kind of you, but I'll 
                         bet it's not altogether true.

                                     PAUL
                         It is.

               She slowly reaches into the pocket of her bathrobe and pulls 
               out a .38 Special.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have this gun, and sometimes I 
                         think about using it.

               She is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun.

                                     ANNIE
                         I better go now. I might put bullets 
                         in it.

               Robot-like, she crosses to the door and leaves. As she closes 
               and locks the door--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stunned, listening, waiting--

               --here is the sound of the front door closing--

               --then footsteps on the outside walk--

               --the sound of a car door opening and slamming shut.

               Now comes the GUNNING of the motor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW as ANNIE drives by, hunched over the wheel. The 
               MOTOR sound grows fainter, faint...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER AND VIRGINIA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

               BUSTER AND VIRGINIA are lying in bed. Buster is reading yet 
               another Misery novel, Misery's Trial. Virginia is also 
               reading.

                                     BUSTER
                         "There is a justice higher than that 
                         of man. I will be judged by Him."

                         What?

                         They're hauling Misery into court.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         That's nice.

                                     BUSTER
                              (mutters under his 
                              breath)
                         "There is a justice higher than that

               ANNIE'S KITCHEN.

               The kitchen KNIVES on the counter.

               PAUL, now using both arms, forcing his body up toward them.

               This isn't easy, it was a bitch the first time he tried it, 
               but nothing's going to stop him now. He's leaning against 
               the cupboard, using it for balance--

               --his balance starts to go but he won't let it as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KNIVES, AS HIS HAND grabs the largest one, a fat-handled 
               sharp beauty and

               PAUL, and you can sense the relief as he begins to lower 
               himself to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STUDY

               PAUL, back in his wheelchair, knife in his lap, carefully 
               opening drawers of little tables, looking inside. He closes 
               them, moves on, unmindful of the rain. Now--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SHELF OF PAUL SHELDON BOOKS. As before--

               --except the "My Life" scrapbook is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, glancing around--

               --and there it is, on a coffee table in the living room. 
               Also on the table are a roll of Scotch tape, a pair of 
               scissors, and a copy of Newsweek. Paul wheels toward the 
               table and the book, which is as big as a folio Shakespeare 
               play and as thick as a family Bible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LIVING ROOM

               PAUL, opening the book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK, as Paul opens it. It's a newspaper 
               clipping as is almost all of what follows. A small article: 
               simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes.

               PAUL turns the page. This headline reads: "Investment Banker 
               Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall."

               "USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall." That's the headline 
               on the next page.

               Now: "Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate."

               Paul turns the page.

               Manchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: "Ernest Gonyar, 79, 
               Dies After Long Illness."

               Now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--"after 
               long illness" is from the next article. "Long illness" from 
               the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation: 
               "Short Illness."

               Now we're in Pennsylvania: "New Hospital Staff Announced."

               And here come those phrases again on page after page--"After 
               Long Illness." "After Long Illness."

               "After Long Illness."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states 
               keep changing, moving west. Pennsylvania to Minnesota, 
               Minnesota to North Dakota. And always the clippings reporting 
               deaths and deaths and--

               --and now we're in Colorado. "NEW HEAD MATERNITY NURSE NAMED." 
               And now the dead are young and helpless; babies. More and 
               more of them.

                                     PAUL
                              (stunned)
                         Holy shit.

               Then a headline which reads:

               "HEAD MATERNITY NURSE QUESTIONED ON INFANT DEATHS"

               Next page: "MISS WILKES RELEASED."

               Next page: "THREE MORE INFANTS DIE."

               Next page, at last: "DRAGON LADY ARRESTED."

               Then a photo: the front page of the Rocky Mountain Gazette. 
               Annie on the courthouse steps. "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE," 
               under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes.

               Paul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline:

               "DRAGON LADY FOUND NOT GUILTY"

               PAUL just sits there, shaking his head in bewilderment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BOOK, as Paul turns the LAST page.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stunned and now we find out why, as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAGE IN THE BOOK. It's an article from Newsweek magazine, 
               a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow. 
               Above it this caption: "Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Slamming the book shut, putting it back on the coffee 
               table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, steering his wheelchair toward the front door. He tries 
               to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he 
               can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too 
               cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his 
               room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles 
               into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his 
               chest and stares up at the ceiling.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL'S WINDOW, hours later. The rain has stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--trying to stay awake. After a few beats, he hears 
               something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP.

               HEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL 
               grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of 
               a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS.

               As the FRONT DOOR OPENS, PAUL girds himself for attack. THE 
               FRONT DOOR CLOSES, then a couple of FOOTSTEPS. Then silence. 
               Then the FOOTSTEPS continue down the hall and up the stairs.

               After a beat, we hear the TELEVISION. Someone is explaining 
               how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate 
               with no money down.

               PAUL, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the 
               mattress. As the TV DRONES ON, Paul lies staring up at the 
               ceiling.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

               We hear a clap of THUNDER and once again the rain pours down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE UP: PAUL--eyes closed. There is another loud THUNDERCLAP 
               which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes.

               He turns his head and another CLAP OF THUNDER is heard, 
               LIGHTNING flashes and reveals ANNIE standing over his bed.

               Before he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls 
               it out and starts out of the room.

               PAUL tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes 
               him to collapse, unconscious.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM. EARLY MORNING.

               It's stopped raining, PAUL lies asleep. Now, surprisingly, 
               we hear a VOICE we've never heard in the movie before--loud--
               for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: 
               It's LIBERACE talking to his audience on a record going, 
               "Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me 
               to be back with you in Paris..." PAUL stirs and awakens to 
               discover that he is strapped to his bed. He can move his 
               arms, but that's it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, standing in the room, and she looks very together; 
               her eyes are bright. Too bright. Way too bright.

               She comes to the foot of his bed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, groggy from being drugged, tries to clear the cobwebs.

                                     ANNIE
                              (in a soft voice)
                         Paul, I know you've been out.

                                     PAUL
                         What?

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been out of your room.

                                     PAUL
                         No, I haven't.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, my little ceramic penguin in 
                         the study always faces due south.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

               PAUL looks up at her--he is totally honest and sincere. As 
               he talks, his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the 
               mattress edge.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, as she brings the fat-hand led knife out of her skirt 
               pocket.

                                     ANNIE
                         Is this what you're looking for? I 
                         know you've been out twice, Paul. At 
                         first, I couldn't figure out how you 
                         did it, but last night I found your 
                         key.
                              (She holds up the 
                              bobby pin)
                         I know I left  my scrapbook out, and 
                         I can imagine what you might be 
                         thinking of me. But you see, Paul, 
                         it's all okay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed.

               And now a THUMP comes from the foot of the bed. Something is 
               out of sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at her; waiting.

                                     ANNIE
                         Last night it came so clear. I realize 
                         you just need more time. Eventually, 
                         you'll come to accept the idea of 
                         being here. Paul, do you know about 
                         the early days at the Kimberly Diamond 
                         Mine? Do you know what they did to 
                         the native workers who stole diamonds? 
                         Don't worry, they didn't kill them. 
                         That would be like junking a Mercedes 
                         just because it had a broken spring--
                         no, if they caught them they had to 
                         make sure they could go on working, 
                         but they also had to make sure they 
                         could never run away. The operation 
                         was called hobbling.

               And with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up 
               holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, whatever you're thinking about, 
                         don't do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just 
               above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't fuss, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would I run away? I'm a writer, 
                         Annie--it's all I am--and I've never 
                         written this well--even you said 
                         that this is my best, didn't you?

               ANNIE picks up a sledgehammer.

                                     PAUL
                         Didn't you? Why would I leave a place 
                         where I'm doing my best work? It 
                         doesn't make any sense.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, positioning herself to the side of his right ankle.

                                     ANNIE
                         Shh, darling, trust me--
                              (taking aim at his 
                              ankle)
                         It's for the best.

               She takes the sledgehammer back.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, for God's sake, please.

               As ANNIE swings, the sledgehammer makes contact with the 
               ankle. It breaks with a sharp CRACK.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP, shrieking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, moving to the other side of the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Almost done, just one more.

               And as she breaks the other ankle, PAUL shrieks even louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP.

                                     ANNIE
                         God, I love you...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S FACE. He is beyond agony.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               For a long moment, nothing.

               Then... a FAINT SOUND. After a moment, it begins to become 
               more intrusive and we can tell what it is: a car horn HONKING.

               FADE IN ON:

               SILVER CREEK and ANNIE in her Cherokee, HONKING for another 
               car to get a move on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HAND AND A COIN MOVING ACROSS IT, from finger to finger.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               BUSTER, sitting by the front window of his office, reading 
               The Rocky Mountain Gazette.

               He watches idly as ANNIE yells out the window to the car in 
               front of her. THE DRIVER of the car yells back. Annie yells 
               louder. The Driver guns off, and Annie pulls into the parking 
               space next to the General Store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting out, shaking a fist at the other car, calling 
               out, "You poop!" She enters the store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, staring straight ahead. Something is gnawing at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, in his office, tidying the desk. BUSTER enters, 
               looks angry.

                                     BUSTER
                         Just leave it, all right?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Oh, I like that tone.

                                     BUSTER
                         How many times do I have to tell you--
                         I have a system here.
                              (rooting through a 
                              pile of papers)
                         Where the hell is that thing?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What thing?

                                     BUSTER
                         That thing.
                              (finding what he's 
                              looking for, a 3 x 5 
                              card)
                         Here it is. Right where it's supposed 
                         to be.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What is it?

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         It's good you found it.

                                     BUSTER
                         There's that spice again.

               As BUSTER leaves, VIRGINIA goes back to tidying the desk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, wearing bifocals, sits poring over bound volumes of

               A SERIES OF HEADLINES pertaining to Annie Wilkes' murder 
               trial.

               A HEADLINE which reads, "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE."

               Under a PICTURE OF ANNIE on the courthouse steps, we see a 
               CAPTION: "Wilkes told reporters on the courthouse steps, 
               'There is a higher justice than that of man; I will be judged 
               by Him.'"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, carrying a bag of feed, followed by MISERY, the sow,

                         Hi, Punkin.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring out at her.

                         Give us a smile?
                              (Paul gives her the 
                              finger. She laughs)
                         Such a kidder.

               As she exits our view--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lifting the typewriter and repeatedly raising it over 
               his head, this time without any difficulty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE GENERAL STORE IN SILVER CREEK. EARLY AFTERNOON.

               BUSTER enters. The place is empty. It's one of those wonderful 
               spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like 
               complete disarray. Buster goes to the coffee urn behind the 
               counter, helps himself. He speaks to the guy who sits behind 
               the counter nearby; these two have known each other forever.

                                     BUSTER
                         Hey, Pete.

                         Answer me a couple things?

                                     PETE
                         If I can.

                                     BUSTER
                         Do you have any of those new Paul 
                         Sheldon books?

                                     PETE
                         We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three 
                         days.

                                     BUSTER
                         You wouldn't happen to remember if 
                         Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?

                         Are you kidding? Every time that 
                         fella writes a book, she makes me 
                         set aside the first copy.

               BUSTER opens the cash register, drops his coffee money inside, 
               closes the register.

                                     BUSTER
                         Has she been buying any odd things 
                         lately?

                                     PETE
                         Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.

                         No, the typing kind.

                         Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about 
                         that.

               He cannot hide his excitement now as we--

               ANNIE, entering Paul's room. He lies back in the wheelchair, 
               eyes closed. Liberace music playing in the background. From 
               the start, PAUL'S TONE is different--strong, he's in control.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, don't you think it's time for 
                         you to start writing again? It's 
                         been over a week.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know, it's weird, but a couple 
                         of broken bones hasn't done a lot 
                         for my creative juices. Get the fuck 
                         out of here.

                         Don't talk to me like that.

                                     PAUL
                              (staring at her now)
                         Why, what are you going to do?
                              (spreading his arms 
                              wide)
                         Kill me? Take your best shot.

                         Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, 
                         you make me burn my book, you drive 
                         a sledgehammer into my ankles...

                         I'll drive a sledgehammer into your

               ANNIE, busily making cocoa.

               BUSTER IN HIS CAR. He stops at a mailbox. The name on the 
               box is WILKES. Buster turns his car slowly into the driveway 
               by the mailbox.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He yawns, opens his eyes briefly. Closes them. In the 
               distance now, growing more and more visible is Buster's car--

               --and now PAUL'S EYES go open wide, and he's staring out the 
               window at the car as it keeps on coming, closer, closer and

               BUSTER, looking around. He's driving very slowly, carefully.

               PAUL. Fixating on the window and now it's all going to be 
               all right, everything's going to be all right--

               --and then ANNIE is on him, hypodermic needle in hand, jabbing 
               it into his arm. He desperately tries to fight her off, but 
               the drug starts to take hold. He tries to grab her by the 
               neck, but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the 
               room, down the hall and towards the cellar door.

                         I don't think I'll ever understand 
                         you. I cook your meals, I tend to 
                         you practically twenty-four hours a 
                         day, and you continue to fight me. 
                         When are we going to develop a sense 
                         of trust?

               ANNIE opens the cellar door. PAUL is all but limp by now. As 
               she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE placing Paul on the cellar floor and heading up the 
               stairs. PAUL is out.

               BUSTER heading up the steps to the front door.

               ANNIE stashing the wheelchair in the hall closet. She crosses 
               to the front door, opens it, revealing BUSTER.

                         You didn't give me a chance to knock.

                         I was just wondering if you happen 
                         to know anything about Paul Sheldon.

                         Well, he was born in Worcester, 
                         Massachusetts, forty-two years ago, 
                         the only child of Franklin and Helene 
                         Sheldon, mediocre student, majored 
                         in history...

                              (cutting in)
                         Excuse me, that's not exactly the 
                         kind of information I was after. You

                         some time now, and...

                         I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his 
                         number-one fan...I've got all his 
                         books, every sentence he ever put 
                         down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon 
                         collection...

                              embarrassed)
                         ...here I am, prattling on and my 
                         manners have just flown away. I 
                         haven't invited you in. Please.

                                     BUSTER
                         Thank you.

               ANNIE lets BUSTER in, closes the door. They linger in front 
               of Paul's door. Buster idly checks out the hallway.

                                     ANNIE
                         'Course you must know about that 
                         horrible accident.

               BUSTER nods and wanders into the living room. ANNIE follows. 
               He crosses into the study and checks out a bookcase that 
               contains the complete works of Paul Sheldon. One shelf below 
               contains Annie's infamous scrapbook.

                                     ANNIE
                         Almost killed me, too. I prayed when 
                         I heard the news. I got down on my 
                         knees and begged for it not to be 
                         true.

               CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She's so moved. Buster wanders into the kitchen.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're going to laugh at what I'm 
                         about to say, but go ahead, I don't 
                         care...
                              (beat)
                         ...when I was praying, God told me 
                         to get ready.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, watching her. This isn't at all what he expected.

                                     BUSTER
                         Get ready for what?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to fight the drug; just his eyes flutter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE and BUSTER heading back down the hallway toward Paul's 
               room.

                                     ANNIE
                         To try and be his replacement--he 
                         gave so much pleasure to so many 
                         people and there's a shortage of 
                         pleasure on this planet these days, 
                         in case you hadn't noticed.

               BUSTER enters Paul's room. ANNIE follows.

                                     ANNIE
                         God told me, since I was his number-
                         one fan, that I should make up new 
                         stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. 
                         So, went to town. And I bought a 
                         typewriter. And paper to type on. 
                         The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And 
                         I turned the guest bedroom into a 
                         writing studio. Would you like to 
                         see it?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sure.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's right this way.

               BUSTER takes a look in the bathroom. ANNIE waits for him.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's right here. I knew how he wrote, 
                         the kinds of words he used, the 
                         wonderful stories he told--
                              (moved)
                         --I've spent the last four weeks 
                         trying to write like Paul Sheldon.
                              (sad shake of the 
                              head)
                         But I can't do it right. I try and I 
                         try and I know all the words--
                              (eyes closed in despair)
                         --but it's just not the same.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He just stands there, watches her.

                                     BUSTER
                         Well...
                              (long pause)
                         ...maybe it takes time to get the 
                         hang of it.

                                     ANNIE
                              (holding up pages 
                              from the manuscript)
                         I could give you a couple of hundred 
                         pages of mine, and you could tell me 
                         what you think.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm not much of a critic.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, I just thought--oh, look at 
                         me. You'd think I'd never had a house 
                         guest before. Would you like something 
                         to drink?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sure.

                                     ANNIE
                         How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sounds good.

               As she exits into the kitchen.

                                     ANNIE
                         There's some already made.

               BUSTER lingers in Paul's room for a beat, then goes into the 
               hallway.

                                     BUSTER
                         Must get lonely, living out here all 
                         by yourself.

                                     ANNIE
                         I always say if you can't enjoy your 
                         own company, you're not fit company 
                         for anyone else.

                                     BUSTER
                         You got a point there...

               As Buster moves up the stairs--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still fighting the drug. His arm twitches almost 
               involuntarily, grazing the barbecue.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER opening the door to Annie's room. He looks around and 
               just as he is about to turn to leave--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, standing right in front of him.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here you are.

               BUSTER heads down the stairs, ANNIE follows.

                                     BUSTER
                         Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want 
                         to take up any more of your time. I 
                         best be going.

                                     ANNIE
                         But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

               They cross to the front door.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm sure it's wonderful, but really 
                         should be getting back.

               BUSTER opens the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL stirring.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER and ANNIE at the door.

                                     BUSTER
                         If you don't mind, perhaps I could 
                         pay you another visit sometime.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'd be delighted. Now that you know 
                         the way...

               With that, she closes the door. We stay with BUSTER. He stands 
               on the front porch for a beat, thinking, then starts heading 
               down the porch steps. Just as he reaches about halfway down, 
               we HEAR A LOUD CRASH coming from inside the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--he has managed to partially fight his way through the 
               drug, and in waking has accidentally knocked over the 
               barbecue. He fights to clear the cobwebs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     BUSTER
                         Miz Wilkes, are you all right?

               There is no answer. He quietly moves into the house.

                                     BUSTER
                         Miz Wilkes?

               Again, no answer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still fighting to gain complete consciousness.

                                     PAUL
                              (weakly)
                         Here. I'm down here. Down here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the 
               sound to the cellar door. As PAUL continues to call out, 
               Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door. 
               The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul, 
               who is still lying on the floor.

                                     BUSTER
                         Mr. Sheldon?

               But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a LOUD 
               EXPLOSION. Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through 
               Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, 
               smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar 
               steps.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't feel bad, Paul. It had to 
                         happen. I've been waiting for this 
                         sign.

               ANNIE walks toward BUSTER'S BODY and very casually takes his 
               gun out of its holster.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've known for some time why I was 
                         chosen to save you. You and I were 
                         meant to be together forever. But 
                         now our time in this world must end. 
                         But don't worry, Paul. I've already 
                         prepared for what must be done. I 
                         put two bullets in my gun, one for 
                         you and one for me. Oh, darling, it 
                         will be so beautiful.

               With that, ANNIE turns and exits the cellar.

               Paul's mind races desperately. He looks at the barbecue again. 
               Next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on 
               it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TABLE. One of the cans is LIGHTER FLUID.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He stares at it for a moment. An idea hits him--

               --now, PAUL struggles and crawls over to the table. He grabs 
               the lighter fluid in his hands, jams it into the rear of his 
               pants and scrambles back to where ANNIE left him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE returning with her .38 Special and a hypodermic needle. 
               She stops at the top of the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't be afraid. I love you.

               She starts toward him.

                                     PAUL
                         I know you do. I love you too, Annie.
                              (this stops her)
                         And you're right. We are meant to be 
                         together. And I know we must die. 
                         But it must be so that Misery can 
                         live. We have the power to give Misery 
                         eternal life. We must finish the 
                         book.

                                     ANNIE
                         But the time is now. Soon others 
                         will come.

                                     PAUL
                         It's almost done. By dawn we'll be 
                         able to give Misery back to the world.

               ANNIE stares at Paul. She could go either way on this. Then, 
               without a word, she turns and goes back up the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here, Paul. I'll fix you something 
                         to eat.

               She exits. PAUL hesitates for a moment, then realizes he has 
               no choice. He starts dragging himself over BUSTER and up the 
               stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               PAUL working. Typing like a madman, totally concentrated on 
               the white paper. His lips move but he's not even aware of 
               it.

               ANNIE enters quietly, holding a few pages.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.

                                     PAUL
                         Three more chapters to go.

               She looks at him now, enthralled.

                                     ANNIE
                         The stranger staying at the Inn, is 
                         he someone from Misery's past?

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe.

                                     ANNIE
                         This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, 
                         her first love, right?

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe. Are you ready for the next 
                         chapter?

               He taunts her with it.

                                     ANNIE
                              (brimming with 
                              enthusiasm)
                         Oh you!

               She takes the pages and goes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. LATER.

               PAUL types a moment then rips out the page and starts over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, putting the coffee down for him, putting the pages 
               back on the main pile.

                                     ANNIE
                              (more excited now 
                              than the last time)
                         It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what 
                         does that do to her love for Ian?--
                              (thinks)
                         --of course, if she hadn't thought 
                         Windthorne was murdered she never 
                         would have fallen in love with Ian 
                         in the first place.
                              (Paul glares at her, 
                              she turns to the 
                              door)
                         Sorry, it's just that this is so 
                         wonderful.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm glad you like it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, this will be our legacy.

                                     PAUL
                         It will.

               He hands her a few more pages, she starts reading as she 
               exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. MUCH LATER.

               PAUL rubs his eyes. For a moment, he sags, but he fights it. 
               He puts a clean page into the typewriter.

               ANNIE bursts in.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind 
                         up with Ian or Windthorne? You have 
                         to tell me.

                                     PAUL
                         You'll know very soon. I'm starting 
                         the last chapter. And when I finish, 
                         I want everything to be perfect. 
                         I'll require three things.

                                     ANNIE
                         What things?

                                     PAUL
                         You don't know?

                                     ANNIE
                              (smiling)
                         I was fooling, silly.
                              (ticking them off)
                         You need a cigarette, because you 
                         used to smoke but you quit except 
                         when you finish a book, and you just 
                         have one, and the match is to light 
                         it. And you need one glass of 
                         champagne.
                              (thinks)
                         Dome Pear-igg-non.

                                     PAUL
                         Dome Pear-igg-non it is.

               AS ANNIE exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW

               The first light of morning is starting to break through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stretching. He makes sure everything is set.

                                     PAUL
                              (calling out)
                         Annie! Annie!

               With that, she enters.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm almost done.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian 
                         and Windthorne dueling for the right 
                         to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, 
                         don't me. It's Windthorne, right?

                                     PAUL
                         You'll know everything in a minute. 
                         Get the champagne.

                                     ANNIE
                              (dying from the 
                              suspense)
                         Ahh!!!

               She exits; PAUL adjusts the manuscript on the table and then 
               types the last line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE IN THE KITCHEN. She takes the bottle of Dom Perignon 
               out of the icebox, places it on a tray with two glasses--
               opens a drawer--takes out the gun--places it in her pocket--
               then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the 
               tray.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               ANNIE enters with the tray. She sets it down on the table.

                                     ANNIE
                         Did I do good?

                                     PAUL
                         You did perfect. Except for one thing. 
                         This time we need two glasses.

               He takes the last page out of the typewriter.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul.

               As soon as she exits, PAUL drops the manuscript to the floor, 
               pulls the lighter fluid from his pants, and starts dousing 
               the manuscript with lighter fluid. He grabs the last chapter 
               and twists the last few pages together torch style. He douses 
               it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight.

               He smiles as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE entering with the second glass...

                                     PAUL
                         It's all right here, Annie. Remember 
                         how for all those years no one ever 
                         knew who Misery's real father was, 
                         or if they'd ever be reunited? It's 
                         all right here. Will Misery finally 
                         lead her countrymen to freedom? Does 
                         she finally marry Ian or will it be 
                         Windthorne? It's all right here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MATCH, as he strikes it and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE screaming--

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, you can't.

               And as her hands fly out beseechingly--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE--it falls to the floor, explodes like a 
               torpedo, shards of glass all over, curds of foam everywhere--

                                     PAUL
                         Why not? I learned it from you...

               And on that--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LAST CHAPTER as Paul brings the match close to it and it 
               bursts into flame. And Paul, holding it like the torch it 
               is. Annie starts moving forward now.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no, NOT MISERY--NOT MY MISERY...!

               He drops the last chapter into the soaked manuscript and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MANUSCRIPT, as KABOOM!, it bursts into flame and--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, transfixed by the sight for a moment,

               --and then she charges.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FIRE as ANNIE rushes to the book, stoops down, grabs it 
               with both hands, brings the burning mass up to her body, 
               both arms across it, trying to smother the flames--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing the typewriter, raising it high above his 
               head, then throwing it down on her with all his power and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER, crashing into the back of her head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, screaming, driven to the floor by the blow, the book 
               beneath her, and the flames fly up, her sweater is starting 
               to burn and she's covered with shards of glass from the 
               shattered bottle of champagne and some of the manuscript is 
               hissing from the liquid, but she is able to struggle to her 
               knees--

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm going to kill you, you lying 
                         cocksucker...

               As she struggles to her feet, she pulls out the gun and shoots 
               at Paul, hitting him in the shoulder. Just as she's about to 
               shoot again, Paul quickly wheels the chair up to her, throws 
               himself out of the chair, and tackles her. The gun flies out 
               of her hand and lands in the hallway, going off as it lands. 
               They wrestle on the floor.

               Flames still around them, PAUL gets on top of her, grabs 
               some burning pages, stuffs them into her mouth, shouting --

                                     PAUL
                         Here. Here. You want it? You want 
                         it? You can eat it--eat it--eat it 
                         till you fucking CHOKE--you sick, 
                         twisted fuck.

               And as he forces more paper into her mouth--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, and she's hideous--blistered, her hands claw at her 
               throat. She makes horrible sounds, spitting the charred chunks 
               of manuscript out of her mouth. Shards of glass are in her 
               hair. Now a shriek and a tremendous jerk of her body and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, falling away --

               ANNIE, still making the sounds as she gets to her feet, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to crawl away after her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE--heading for the door, she takes a step away from Paul, 
               then another, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, suddenly kicking out with his shattered leg, screaming 
               in pain as it crashes into her ankle and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, trying to keep her balance, not doing well, her arms 
               windmilling as she fights for balance one last moment, fights 
               and loses, and now, as she topples over--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER as she falls and her head slams into it, 
               collides with the sharp metal and a great wound opens in her 
               head. There is one final cry. Blood pours. It's over. All 
               over. We are looking at a dead body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, exhausted, panting, lying there, trying to gather his 
               energy. He starts to crawl for the door. Just as he reaches 
               the doorjamb, an arm grabs his leg, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, shrieking, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, pulling herself up his body and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to buck her off, but he can't and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, the stronger, relentless, moving up on him, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, his grip broken as he turns and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, all-powerful, looming over him and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, hitting up at her and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, swelling, and the blood pours down and if she feels 
               his blows she doesn't show it and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, whatever energy he has left he uses now, trying to 
               twist and strike and as his body moves--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               METAL BASED FLOOR LAMP and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing the thing, suddenly bringing it across his 
               body, clobbering Annie in the face and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, startled by the power of the blow and for a moment 
               she is stopped and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as with everything he has left, he crunches her forehead 
               with the sharp heavy metal base, just creams her as the air 
               is forced out of her--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. Her eyes roll up into her head. For a moment all we 
               see are the whites--

               --then she collapses on PAUL, a motionless mountain of slack 
               flesh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, scrambling free, pushing her off him, crawling for the 
               door--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               --outside the door, as PAUL crawls into view, makes it to 
               the corridor, reaches back, closes the door, locks it.

               Safe, he collapses, exhausted against the wall opposite the 
               door.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL. HOURS LATER. It is dawn. He is awakened by a loud 
               smashing at the front door. After a couple of heart-stopping 
               pounds,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FRONT DOOR smashes open, revealing two cops with guns 
               drawn.

               THE POLICEMEN, hurrying to PAUL. The YOUNGER COP kneels beside 
               Paul.

                                     YOUNGER COP
                         It's the writer--the dead one--

                                     PAUL
                              (trying to keep himself 
                              together)
                         --right! I'm the dead one--

                                     OLDER COP
                         Where's Sheriff McCain?

                                     PAUL
                         He's in the cellar. She killed him.

                                     OLDER COP
                         Annie Wilkes?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah. She's in there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The OLDER COP, taking the key to the room, unlocks the door, 
               throws it open, and as he steps inside--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE BEDROOM

               The OLDER COP has his gun ready to fire, but even with it 
               tight in his hand, he's edgy as hell.

               He looks around--

               --glass and bloodstains on the floor. The charred remains of 
               a manuscript.

               He kneels quickly, glances under the bed--nothing.

               He looks at the window--wide open.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL and the YOUNGER COP. Pause. The OLDER COP is in the 
               doorway now.

                                     OLDER COP
                         Mr. Sheldon? There's no one in there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. In shock.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PALM COURT, PLAZA HOTEL

               This legend appears: ONE YEAR LATER

               MARCIA SINDELL is seated at a table. PAUL enters, walking 
               briskly, and he's never looked this good before. He's gained 
               his weight back, his color is normal again. He appears to 
               be, for the first time in the movie, a jaunty, happy figure.

                                     PAUL
                         Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball 
                         game went into overtime. If anybody 
                         ever told me I'd have a daughter 
                         who'd get a triple double, I'd...

                                     SINDELL
                         Did they win?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah. They're in the semis.

                                     SINDELL
                         Here it is.
                              (big moment)
                         Very first copy.

               And she hands him a wrapped package. PAUL sits, begins 
               unwrapping it. It's a book. A new one by Paul Sheldon. The 
               Higher Education of J. Phillip Stone. Paul turns it over 
               gently in his hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL

                                     SINDELL
                         The word I'm getting is the Times 
                         review is gonna be a love letter.

                                     PAUL
                         That'd be a first.

                                     SINDELL
                         And my contacts at Time and Newsweek 
                         tell me they're both raves. And don't 
                         laugh--for the first time, I think 
                         you've got a shot at some prizes.

                                     PAUL
                              (flatly)
                         Great.

                                     SINDELL
                         I thought you'd be thrilled. You're 
                         being taken seriously.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm delighted the critics are liking 
                         it, and I hope the people like it, 
                         too. But it's not why I wrote the 
                         book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. There is a genuine sense of peace about him. 
               He has been through the fire and survived.

                                     PAUL
                         I like it. Remember how you once 
                         said I live my whole life as if I'm 
                         in danger of being found out? Well, 
                         I believe I've managed to get that 
                         guy down on paper.
                              (He touches the book. 
                              Beat.)
                         Don't think I'm completely nuts, but 
                         in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole 
                         experience, helped me.

                                     SINDELL
                         Paul, since you brought her up, I 
                         have to ask you this, or I'd be 
                         drummed out of the agents' union--
                         what about a non-fiction book? The 
                         truth about what went on in that 
                         house.

                                     PAUL
                         Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you 
                         better, I'd think you were suggesting 
                         I dredge up the worst horror of my 
                         life just so we could make a few 
                         bucks.

                                     SINDELL
                         Now you've hurt me, Paul.

               As Paul glances around...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking past MARCIA.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DESSERT TROLLEY, some distance away, being pushed by a 
               waitress. It is ANNIE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND SINDELL

                                     SINDELL
                         I thought you were over it.

                                     PAUL
                         I am. Well, maybe not completely--

               He glances toward the trolley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DESSERT TROLLEY, moving inexorably closer to PAUL. ANNIE 
               reaches down and pulls out a very sharp knife.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND SINDELL

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know if you can ever be 
                         totally over something like that--I 
                         just don't think about it as much 
                         anymore, and when I do, it's not so 
                         terrifying.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, with the knife raised.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring up at ANNIE.

                                     PAUL
                         I mean, once they found her body, my 
                         nightmares stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE--only it isn't Annie, just a WAITRESS. She 
               stands by the trolley, the knife in her hand, ready to slice 
               whatever anyone wants.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Would you care for anything?

                                     PAUL
                              (smiles)
                         Cut me something sinful...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. The smile holds. In the background now, soft music: 
               someone might be playing "Liberace."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. LATE AFTERNOON SKY

               Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of 
               sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day.

               SUPER TITLE: "HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020."

               As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE.

                                     PHIL
                         T minus ten, nine, eight, start 
                         ignition sequence, five, four, three, 
                         two, one, ignition... Liftoff!

               A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, 
               ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER, 
               excited SHOUTS.

               EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON

               DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a 
               gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has 
               got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using 
               an empty longneck as his launching tube.

                                     CHILDREN
                              (all at once)
                         My turn! My turn! No, I was next! 
                         No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can 
                         I do one? I want to do one!

                                     PHIL
                         Guys, guys, please! This is risky 
                         stuff here. And I'm a highly trained 
                         professional.

               Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. 
               There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting 
               poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for 
               silence.

                                     PHIL
                         Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch 
                         another booster...

               Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, 
               is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and 
               Phil catches it.

                                     PHIL
                         ...just as soon as he completes his 
                         fuel intake.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE

               Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin 
               to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in 
               the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. 
               DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their 
               families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out 
               blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of 
               balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, 
               from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed 
               about. A banner, strung between trees, reads "BON VOYAGE, 
               MARS ONE!!!"

                                     WILLIS
                         It'll take us six months just to get 
                         to Mars. Another year on the surface, 
                         then six months back. That's two 
                         years...

               Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, 
               NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm 
               around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, 
               ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, 
               early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all 
               too well.

                                     WILLIS
                         I guess what I'm trying to say is, 
                         since this is my last night on Earth, 
                         it's gonna be a very precious memory 
                         to me. Y'know?

                                     PRETTY GIRL
                         Nice try, Nick.

               As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and 
               walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his 
               beer, swigs it.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-
               pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has 
               paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI 
               KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as 
               they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily 
               at the chef.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't 
                         be heading back to Earth till ten 
                         days after you guys land at our base 
                         camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty 
                         good long rendezvous.

               WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat 
               over a Hawaiian shirt and a "KISS THE CHEF" apron. An entire 
               pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting 
               this as he smiles at Malik.

                                     WOODY
                         What are you suggesting, Sergei?

                                     KIROV
                         Maybe you should bring a baseball 
                         bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two 
                         crews could have ourselves a little 
                         Solar System Series.

                                     WOODY
                         Please. Half you guys are foreigners. 
                         We'd crush you.

                                     KIROV
                         No, no, we have equal crews. Three 
                         men, one woman. Same handicap.

               He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.

                                     WOODY
                         Easy now, you're talking about my 
                         wife.
                              (seeing her approach)
                         And Terri just happens to be one 
                         helluva shortstop.

               DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of 
               corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive 
               by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss 
               Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. 
               Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.

                                     TERRI
                         Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls 
                         his own strikes. Thousand bucks make 
                         it interesting?

               He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who 
               smiles, nods her cool agreement.

                                     COTE
                         Eh bien. Winner take all.

                                     TERRI
                         Good.
                              (smiles sweetly at 
                              Kirov)
                         Bring some balls.

               The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as 
               Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt 
               grin.

                                     WOODY
                         You wanna know the sad part? 
                         Technically I outrank her. But if we 
                         want any peace at all on Mars Two, 
                         I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes, 
                         dears."

               The others laugh.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run 
               by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a 
               picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers 
               of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         ...just not sure how I feel about 
                         NASA allowing couples to go on this 
                         type of mission together.

               One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st 
               Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter.

                                     1ST WIFE
                              (embarrassed)
                         Nothing personal, Terri. It's just 
                         that, well, it's kind of a funny 
                         feeling for those of us staying 
                         behind.

                                     TERRI
                              (carefully neutral)
                         All the research shows that marriage 
                         will provide stability on these long 
                         duration trips.

                                     2ND WIFE
                         Then they haven't studied some of 
                         the couples I've known.

               Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really 
               have much in common with these women -- before moving on. 
               ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight 
               tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around.

                                     3RD WIFE
                         Anybody seen Jim McConnell?

                                     4TH WIFE
                         I don't think he's coming.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         God, that poor man. How's he doing?

                                     2ND WIFE
                         Totally losing it, from what I hear. 
                         Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her 
                         grave almost every day.
                              (lowers her voice)
                         They say he could lose mission status.

                                     3RD WIFE
                         Oh, that's so sad. That is just so 
                         tragic. You go to a routine physical 
                         one day, and wham.

                                     4TH WIFE
                         After all those years of training, 
                         too. It was their whole dream.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         Must be a pretty funny feeling for 
                         Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna 
                         be in the history books. First man 
                         on Mars...

               She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in 
               agreement, following her glance...

               In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, 
               his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs 
               which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another 
               figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him.

               CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early 
               30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE 
               GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the 
               restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her 
               approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her 
               with an apologetic smile.

                                     DEBRA
                         He's not coming, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim deserves this, too. All his 
                         friends are here. And it's my last 
                         night.

                                     DEBRA
                              (gently)
                         Your last night with us, too.

               He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his 
               arms around her waist, kisses her forehead.

                                     LUKE
                         I love you, Deb.

                                     DEBRA
                         I love you too, baby. But maybe you 
                         should spend some time with Bobby.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah. I will. Where is he?

                                     DEBRA
                         Up in his fort.

               He kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him, 
               with a mixture of pride and sadness.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into

               EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON

               Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still 
               shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.

               In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes 
               Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to 
               PRETTY GIRL #2.

                                     WILLIS
                         Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. 
                         But I guess I'll have my memories to 
                         keep me warm...

               Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he 
               reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.

               A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around 
               his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby 
               on a tripod. He looks lonely.

               Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. 
               BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at 
               the sky.

                                     BOBBY
                         Who's gonna read to me now, at 
                         bedtime?

               Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.

                                     LUKE
                         Mommy will.

                                     BOBBY
                         I like when you do it. Now we're 
                         never gonna finish our book.

               His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. 
               Luke is moved. Another brief silence.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I'll tell you what. I've been 
                         thinking about that. And what I 
                         thought was -- how 'bout if I bring 
                         along my own copy?
                              (Bobby looks at him)
                         Then every night, wherever I am, 
                         I'll read a little bit more of it. 
                         And I'll know that you and Mommy, 
                         wherever you are, you're reading it 
                         too. That way, it'll feel like we're 
                         still reading it together. 'Cause I 
                         don't know about you, but I'm pretty 
                         anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn 
                         got marooned on that island. What 
                         d'you say?

               Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. 
               Luke is proud of his son's courage.

                                     LUKE
                         Good deal. Can I have a hug?

               Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke 
               fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin 
               young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. 
               Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. 
               They both turn.

               An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.

               Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.

               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON

               The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver 
               climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes 
               out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. 
               The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a 
               moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards 
               the party, then pauses again.

               Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She 
               smiles tentatively.

               JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has 
               dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.

               Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet 
               competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural 
               leader.

               Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They 
               separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining.

                                     DEBRA
                         We were afraid you wouldn't come.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I caught a whiff of your barbecue. 
                         After that I was helpless.

                                     DEBRA
                         All the way out in Galveston?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Something like that.
                              (she smiles)
                         It's his night, Deb. I didn't want 
                         to spoil it.

                                     DEBRA
                         Spoil it? He's been going crazy 
                         looking for you.

               Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around 
               Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them 
               so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are 
                         gonna be mighty glad to see you.

               McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and 
               together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards 
               the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

               All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: 
               McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of 
               the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched 
               behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They 
               zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.

               EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT

               The yard is nearly deserted. The "Bon Voyage" banner has 
               torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a 
               napkin blows across the ground.

               In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the 
               waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.

               CLOSER ON THIS TRIO

               As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a 
               moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the 
               sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots 
               mingling with the silver ones.

                                     WOODY
                              (abruptly)
                         I wish we were all going. Together.

               The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even 
               Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat.

                                     LUKE
                         Then you've got a short memory. Think 
                         back to how we were by the second 
                         week of lunar training.

                                     WOODY
                         Oh, you're not gonna bring that up 
                         again --

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         I'm trying to remember, let's see, 
                         which one of us scored the lowest 
                         ranking up there?

                                     WOODY
                         You just can't let that go --

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, man, three commanders, on the 
                         same ship? If they sent us off to 
                         Mars together, there wouldn't be 
                         enough fuel to lift all those egos.

                                     WOODY
                              (laughs)
                         Bullshit, we would've made a great 
                         crew.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That was never gonna happen. I was 
                         always teamed with Maggie, and we 
                         were mostly chalkboard jockies. You 
                         know? Systems. Payloads...

                                     LUKE
                         Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time 
                         Magazine!

                                     WOODY
                         Yeah, who landed the crippled Block 
                         II Shuttle?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, and who scored highest on the 
                         lunar rankings?

                                     WOODY
                         Let it go, Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (smiles)
                         Sure, I made a little noise. But 
                         putting the first footprints on Mars? 
                         Nah. That's for guys who...
                              (looks at Luke)
                         ...wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how 
                         to colonize the place. And guys who...
                              (looks at Woody)
                         ...read too much science fiction as 
                         a kid and still wear little Flash 
                         Gordon rocketships around their necks.

               He grabs playfully at Woody's neck. Woody smacks his hand 
               away, laughing.

                                     WOODY
                         You read the same damn science fiction 
                         books that I did! You're just not 
                         man enough to wear jewelry!

               He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship 
               emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at 
               McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh.

                                     WOODY
                         You want Flash. You know you want 
                         him. Well you'll have to come through 
                         me!

               Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at 
               the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. 
               McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         God, she would've loved to see you 
                         two clowns. Just one more time.

               He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once 
               his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. 
               Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell 
               shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them, 
               walking away a few steps.

               Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.

               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT

               McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette. 
               McConnell has regained his composure.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time 
                         you donated this thing to a museum?

               Woody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily. He grins.

                                     WOODY
                         Internal combustion, boys. Accept no 
                         substitutes.

               Luke laughs. Woody looks at McConnell.

                                     WOODY
                         Jim, if there's ever... if there's 
                         anything Terri and I can do --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm okay. Really. Thanks.

               Woody reaches out to shake Luke's hand.

                                     WOODY
                         See you when I get to Mars, Luke. 
                         Don't solve all the mysteries of the 
                         universe, okay? Leave a little 
                         something for the next guys.

                                     LUKE
                         I'll see what I can do. Just make 
                         sure you bring some fresh beer.

                                     WOODY
                         You got it.

               With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into 
               gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence. 
               Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We 
               sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this.

                                     LUKE
                         Should've been your mission, Jim. 
                         Yours and Maggie's.

               McConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still.

                                     LUKE
                         None of us ever wanted Mars the way 
                         you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve 
                         years of hoping for this assignment, 
                         training for it --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's all over now.

                                     LUKE
                         If Maggie hadn't gotten sick -- if 
                         you hadn't pulled yourself out of 
                         the rotation to take care of her --

               McConnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger. He will 
               not tolerate pity. Luke sees this but presses on.

                                     LUKE
                         No, I'm gonna say this. I have to 
                         say it...
                              (pause)
                         I wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled 
                         you for it every step of the way. 
                         Never wanted to beat anybody so bad 
                         in my life. But not like this... 
                         Jim, I'd give this all up in a second, 
                         if it would bring Maggie back to us.

               McConnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn't trust 
               his own voice.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I know that, Luke. You don't have to 
                         say it... Mars is yours now. Go get 
                         it.

                                     LUKE
                              (pause)
                         Take care of yourself.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah. You too.

               Luke nods. They grab hands for a second, then let go. Luke 
               walks back towards his house. McConnell watches him for a 
               moment, then turns, walks over to his Jeep. He opens his 
               door, then pauses. He turns. Looks up at --

               EXT. NIGHT SKY

               A tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily. Mars 
               itself, a tantalizing prize. But for him now, more distant 
               than ever. For him, perhaps, never to be attained.

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE

               As we see these thoughts going through him. After a moment 
               he looks down at

               HIS SHOES

               And the sandy verge of the front yard.

               MCCONNELL'S EYES

               Are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite 
               yearning. Gently, a bit self-consciously, HE LIFTS ONE SHOE

               And sets it down again, making a careful, deliberate footprint 
               in the sandy soil...

               EXT. MARS. CHRYSE PLANITIA. DAY

               Instantly we're hurled into an immense, stunning LANDSCAPE, 
               mysterious and vivid as a fever dream. Dazzling sunlight. A 
               vast plain of rust-orange soil. Countless craters. Boulders 
               the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods. Twin 
               moons hanging in a salmon-pink sky. On the horizon, towering, 
               craggy peaks. And, at center -- the only sign of life -- a 
               small, mysterious, moving puff of dust.

               EXT. MARS. DAY

               CLOSER ANGLE as a small, Sojourner-like, multi-wheeled robotic 
               vehicle ambles INTO FRAME, jouncing along the orange Martian 
               soil, pausing to snuffle its sensors towards the occasionally 
               interesting rock. Lettering on its side reads "ARES-8."

               SUPER TITLE: "MARS. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. EIGHT MONTHS LATER."

               Suddenly Ares-8 pauses. Its video lens WHIRRS out, fine-tuning 
               focus, as it becomes intrigued by something OFFSCREEN -- a 
               higher, more distant target. The little fellow almost quivers 
               with excitement.

               EXT. MARS. TIU VALLIS. DAY

               A one-man ATV ROVER waits in the background, in a dry 
               streambed, as Luke, in an EVA spacesuit, swings a clawed 
               rock hammer against a multi-layered, sedimentary rock face. 
               Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit. Despite that bulk, 
               he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth's). 
               A hunk of rock breaks off, and Luke examines it more closely, 
               holding it up to his clear faceplate. He's very happy, 
               absorbed in this work, when his RADIO CRACKLES.

                                     COTE
                         Luke, you read me?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, Renee.

                                     COTE
                         Luke, I just got ARES-8 on line and... 
                         Well, we think you're gonna wanna 
                         see this for yourself.

               Luke, though reluctant to break off work, is intrigued.

                                     LUKE
                         Copy that.

               As Luke turns away, headed for the rover

               To REVEAL a STAGGERING PROSPECT, seen for the first time: 
               Valles Marineris, that planet-creasing slash. So wide, so 
               deep, it boggles the mind: on earth it would reach from New 
               York to L.A.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               The crew of Mars One - Kirov, Willis, and Cote -- have joined 
               Luke, gathered around some display monitors. They're in NASA 
               jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced 
               gravity, and heat. All are captivated by what they see. ON A 
               VIDEO SCREEN

               We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt-
               covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge. 
               What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely 
               protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along 
               the mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast 
               to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's 
               more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth, 
               multi-planed symmetry.

                                     LUKE
                         What the hell is that?

                                     COTE
                         No idea, boss.

                                     LUKE
                         Where is it?

               Cote glances at the others. They're all smirking, as if they 
               share some secret joke Luke's not yet in on.

                                     WILLIS
                         You don't wanna know.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon, what's so funny? Gimme the 
                         coordinates.

               He leans over to read a digital gauge, but Cote covers it 
               with her hand, enjoying the tease.

                                     COTE
                         Latitude 41 degrees north, longitude 
                         9 degrees west.

                                     LUKE
                         The Plains of Cydonia. So?
                              (pause)
                         Oh no. You're not telling me --

               They all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke's expression is 
               incredulous, exasperated.

                                     COTE
                         Oui. Exactement! It's Kirov's fault, 
                         he picked today's sector.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, c'mon! We've got a scientific 
                         duty to check that thing out.

               Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote. 
               They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without 
               success to coax more resolution.

                                     LUKE
                         Great. That's great. The first anomaly 
                         we hit, and it's gotta be in the one 
                         place guaranteed to make NASA look 
                         ridiculous... You know how many books 
                         have been written about that damned 
                         mountain?

                         impact craters happen to look like 
                         eye sockets. If this gets out, we'll

                         off on the six o'clock news... C'mon, 
                         people, gimme a read here. Is that a 
                         cinder cone?

                         Nah, too smooth. Too angular. Volcanic 
                         upwelling?

                         It's an upwelling, for sure. But 
                         maybe not volcanic...

               The others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, with 
               growing excitement. He points to the screen.

                                     LUKE
                         Look at the color. And see how shiny 
                         it is? I could swear that's ice...

                         Impossible. You can't have ice at 
                         this latitude. Not unless...

               They look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping from 
               one to another of them. They're almost trembling.

                                     WILLIS
                         Oh my God.

                         Sixteen kilometers northeast. Take 
                         us twenty minutes to get there.

                         Let's send a packet to Micker. Then 
                         we'll go check it out.

               Slide back, REVEALING the crew in EVA suits, carrying gear. 
               They walk over to...

               THE FOUR-MAN ROVER

               The astronauts climb in through the hatch. The last one in 
               pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. We see Cote 
               and Luke check their screens and press some buttons. Luke 
               puts the rover in drive.

               WIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY

               As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking 
               up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the 
               Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna 
               can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate, 
               inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's also an OXYGEN STILL, 
               PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred 
               meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which 
               arrived as a separate, unmanned flight.

               Rows of SOLAR PANELS, arrayed on the ground, and an AMERICAN 
               FLAG on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISP). EARTH ORBIT. DAY

               A vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT is drifting 
               majestically above Earth. The main hull displays both NASA 
               and U.N. flag decals.

               SUPER TITLE: "INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION 
               CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG."

               We MOVE IN towards another of the station's segments, which 
               is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and 
               insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and 
               Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where 
               Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight. We 
               hear LUKE'S EXCITED VOICE, over speakers.

                         This is a truly anomalous formation. 
                         Looks like nothing we've seen so 
                         far. The structure appears to be 
                         crystalline, at least from the angle 
                         displayed by ARES-8 ...

               On a large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, we see Luke and the Mars 
               One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab, 
               finishing lunch while taping this VIDEO MESSAGE.

                         up here, but -- we think there's a 
                         good chance this could be an extrusion 
                         from some subsurface, geothermal 
                         column of water. And if we're right...

               He looks at his crew. They beam like cats who ate canaries.

                                     LUKE
                         ...then we've found the key to 
                         permanent human colonization.

               IN THE MMCR

               There's an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS, 
               FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS. This would be a fantastic, 
               epochal discovery.

               MCCONNELL

               Sits at the center console, wearing a headset. He's now the 
               Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is 
               brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for 
               instructions.

                         to scramble on this. Full-court press.

               The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the 
               intense excitement of those around him, stares up at

               THE SCREEN

               Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the 
               excitement their bombshell will create.

                                     LUKE
                         Anyway, we'are going out to take a 
                         closer look at it, try to get an 
                         idea of its composition.
                              (checks his watch)
                         By the time you receive this, we 
                         should be just about on-site.

               The rover is a hundred meters away and moving fast TOWARDS 
               CAMERA. We BOOM DOWN to REVEAL Ares-8, still faithfully 
               holding its point, like an Irish Setter, with its video snout 
               WHIRRING OUT.

               The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby. The hatch 
               door cracks open and some dust vents out. The door opens all 
               the way and the astronauts climb out. They all look up in 
               awe. We hear their voices ON RADIOS.

                                     KIROV
                         Jesus Christ...

               THE MYSTERIOUS PEAK

               Gleams in the sun, dazzling white, its facets as planed and 
               smooth as if an architect had drawn them. It pierces through 
               the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an 
               isolated, butte-like giant, stretching two miles from left 
               to right in front of them.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Walk towards the mountain. There's a very deep, very low, 
               staccato tone intruding over their headsets.

                                     LUKE
                         Anyone else hear that?

                                     COTE
                         Yeah. What is it?

                                     WILLIS
                         Sounds like our antenna's out of 
                         phase.

                                     LUKE
                         Can you fix it?

                                     WILLIS
                         Hey, skip, I can fix anything.

                                     LUKE
                         Big talker. Renee, Sergei, let's 
                         break out the radar, see what this 
                         thing's made of.

               As they go to their jobs, the deep, barely audible rumbling 
               tone continues.

               INT. SPACE STATION. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MMCR. DAY

               MULTINATIONAL CREWMEMBERS walk by, in the artificial gravity 
               of the busy station, as RAY BECK, mid-50s, approaches from 
               the opposite direction. Beck is the tough, crewcut, PR-savvy 
               head of the NASA Mars Program (ID'd by his name tag), and 
               just now he's leading a covey of U.N. AMBASSADORS on a tour. 
               The ambassadors, of both sexes, many nations, and all races, 
               look as excited as schoolkids.

                                     BECK
                         ...and this is the Mars Mission 
                         Control Room, nicknamed "Micker." I 
                         understand a comm packet is incoming 
                         from Mars One Base Camp, so you may 
                         find this interesting.

               He opens the doors, ushering his flock inside.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               The ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive 
               array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big 
               screen. Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. The 
               NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns to Beck, whispering curiously.

                                     AMBASSADOR
                         That man over there. He's in charge?

               BECK FOLLOWS HIS GLANCE TO

               MCCONNELL

               Who is surrounded by a KNOT OF TECHNICIANS, to whom he is 
               giving quiet, precise instructions. They hover, then depart, 
               like so many eager bees.

               BECK

               Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding.

                                     BECK
                         No, actually, that's Jim McConnell, 
                         the CAPCOM. Our voice link to the 
                         astronauts? Jim's been with the manned 
                         Mars program since its inception. 
                         One of our real pioneers.

                                     AMBASSADOR
                         Will he be going to Mars, too?

                                     BECK
                         Ah, no. This is as close as he gets.

               ON THE SCREEN

               Luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing 
               away their dishes and leftovers.

                                     LUKE
                         ...anyway, that's about it. We'll 
                         send another packet when we get back.

               Cote clears her throat, gives Luke a look. The others can 
               barely conceal their grins.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, right. One more thing. Today is 
                         a very special day for a good friend 
                         of ours, and I know he's there right 
                         now.

               McConnell looks at the screen, worried. What's Luke up to?

                                     LUKE
                         Now, he hates it when any fuss is 
                         made, so I won't mention his name...

               A look of relief comes over McConnell.

                                     LUKE
                         ...because the last thing in the 
                         world I'd ever want to do is embarrass 
                         someone like Jim McConnell.

               McConnell winces -- Dear God, no -- as, on the screen, Kirov 
               appears from OFF CAMERA holding a cupcake with a burning 
               candle stuck in it, and the Mars One crew starts SINGING 
               "Happy Birthday" to him. Loudly. And very off-key.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon, you Micker weasels, sing!

               Soon most everyone in MMCR is singing along -- even some of 
               the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception of 
               Beck, who stiffens unhappily. McConnell is mortified.

                                     LUKE
                              (sings a line, then, 
                              to CAMERA:)
                         Hey, Ray! Take a look at him! Is he 
                         all red with one of those fake "I'm-
                         a-good-sport" grins?

               Beck looks over at McConnell, who indeed is red in the face 
               with a fake "I'm-a-good-sport" grin.

                                     LUKE
                         And hey, you guys, check out Ray! 
                         Does he have on one of his "This-
                         wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" faces?

               Indeed, Beck's smile is thin, sour, disapproving.

                                     LUKE
                         Nothing you can do about it, Ray! 
                         We're a hundred million miles away!

               Luke and the crew finish singing the song. Luke raises the 
               cupcake in a toast.

                                     LUKE
                         Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make a wish!

               He and his crew lean in, blow out the candle. They laugh and 
               applaud, then wave goodbye.

                                     LUKE
                         Catch you again soon. Take care, 
                         buddy. End of transmission.

               Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display screen 
               GOES BLACK.

               Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoyed, 
               as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's 
               fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Cote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover. Kirov 
               has a big radar gun on a tripod, pointing at the mountain. 
               Luke turns to Cote.

                                     LUKE
                         Well? What's under there?

                                     COTE
                              (puzzled)
                         Je ne sais pas. I... I think there's 
                         something wrong with the equipment.

                                     LUKE
                         What?

                                     COTE
                         I mean, it can't be right. It says... 
                         it says there's metal under there.

               Luke doesn't understand. He walks up to look at the display 
               screen.

                                     COTE
                              (points)
                         There's ten, twelve meters of rubble 
                         and sand, and then... solid metal.

                                     LUKE
                         That doesn't make any sense. You're 
                         reading a vein of ore.

                                     COTE
                              (shakes her head)
                         No. It's under the whole mountain.

               The deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns.

                                     LUKE
                         Nick, could the problem with the 
                         antenna be interfering?

                                     WILLIS
                         Could be.

                                     LUKE
                              (to Cote and Kirov)
                         Try it closer and up the power. I'll 
                         watch the screen.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell is taping an audio message to be sent to Mars as 
               the rest of MMCR looks on. Beck is gone. So are the U. N. 
               ambassadors.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Ah, we're all pretty stoked about 
                         that formation you spotted, Mars 
                         One. The folks in the geology and 
                         hydrology back rooms are going over 
                         your images and comparing them to 
                         every photomap they've got.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Cote and Kirov are close to the foot of the mountain, 
               resetting the radar gun on its tripod. The deep vibrating 
               tone continues.

               Luke is some distance away, by the rover. He looks at Willis, 
               who's still working on the rover's antenna.

                                     LUKE
                         Nick, how we coming on that antenna?

                                     WILLIS
                         Goin' as fast as I can, boss.

               Cote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches on 
               the radar gun. They turn towards Luke and Willis.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, Nick. Come show me how stupid I 
                         am. I can't get this to work.

               Willis looks at Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis starts 
               towards the radar gun.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell is handed a slip of paper, glances at it.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Medical wants me to remind you that 
                         you're three days late on your blood 
                         tests. I know they're a bore, but 
                         you've got to get them done, or 
                         else... or else I don't know what. 
                         Just do them, okay?

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Willis, Cote, and Kirov get the radar gun up and running.

                                     KIROV
                         All set here, chief.

               Luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Crank up the juice and let's 
                         see what's in this sucker.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell checks over his clipboard list of updates.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I think that's about it for business. 
                         But on a personal note, be advised 
                         that, ah, none of you can sing worth 
                         a damn.

               LAUGHTER in the MMCR.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke watches the screen on the rover, as, by the mound...

               KIROV

               Flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle 
               slowly across the near slope of the mountain. We hear and 
               feel the radar signal. The immediate result is that the 
               pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops.

               LUKE

               Looks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression.

                                     LUKE
                         Why did that stop?

               A split-second later, he gets his answer. We hear a WHOOSH, 
               a mighty rushing of wind, as

               A GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER

               Starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the 
               mountain, at its center. As it swirls, the cylinder picks up 
               debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface 
               of the slopes.

               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

               Stare up at this spectacle, awed. A cyclone? Some kind of 
               energy wave? They have no idea. At the moment they're too 
               fascinated to even be scared.

               TILTING UP - FROM THEIR POV

               We see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher, 
               perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a 
               skyscraper. As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing 
               at its top into a conical vortex. It's sucking up so much 
               dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the 
               accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent 
               outer "skin".

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Exchange amazed glances. Can't believe their eyes...

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell still hovers by the microphone.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Honestly, Luke, if you guys don't 
                         have anything better to do with your 
                         time, I can make some suggestions to 
                         mission medical. There are worse 
                         things than blood tests.

               LAUGHTER and GROANS from the staff in MMCR.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke, still staring in fascination, becomes aware of sand 
               and pebbles flashing past his helmet. From behind. He turns.

               SAND PATTERS AGAINST HIS FACEPLATE

               As the nearby landscape BLURS. The vacuuming effect is 
               becoming more general across the area. More violent.

               LUKE IS ALARMED

               And the spell is broken. He keys his throat mike, his lips 
               moving, but no sound can be heard over the ROARING WIND. He 
               waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards 
               the rover. Wind whips at their EVA suits as they obey him, 
               retreating.

               Luke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off 
               the cylinder.

               Then he sees that one man -- Willis -- hasn't moved. In fact 
               he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder. Luke hurries 
               over to him, tugs his sleeve.

               WILLIS LOWERS HIS CAMERA

               But still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face 
               with a cobra. Luke follows the young astronaut's frightened 
               gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees

               THE TOP OF THE VORTEX

               Beginning to tilt down, then coil sideways. Suddenly they're 
               looking into the huge open "mouth" of it, as sand and rocks 
               fly into the swirling darkness...

               The monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the 
               mountain, turning this way, then that. Seeking them. And 
               then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little 
               group of astronauts. And lunges towards them...

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke and Willis turn, running as hard as they can towards 
               the rover. But the suction is so great, it's as if they're 
               held back by wires.

               The ground itself is SHAKING, RUMBLING, as earthquakes begin 
               to open fissures across the plain. The ROAR of the vortex, 
               the GROANING of the earth, are like an onrushing freight 
               train...

               AHEAD OF THEM

               In the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out 
               Cote and Kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their 
               strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast.

               Suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes 
               into Cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her 
               instantly. Blood sprays into the wind, immediately 
               crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets...

               LUKE, HORRIFIED, FLINGS HIS ARM UP

               As bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. An 
               instant later he sees

               KIROV

               Snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying 
               blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream 
               as he vanishes...

               THE GROUND AT LUKE'S FEET

               Abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. Scrabbling 
               frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily 
               arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with 
               his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. The air is 
               almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound 
               over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him 
               alive...

               CLOSE ON LUKE

               Barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final 
               instant, as...

               HIS LAST CREWMAN, WILLIS

               Is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning 
               and tumbling like a rag doll...

               CLOSE ON WILLIS'S FACE

               His features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at 
               him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood, 
               and...

               DISTANT ANGLE - LUKE'S POV

               Willis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating 
               into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the 
               hellish maelstrom. And then that maelstrom itself, just as 
               abruptly...

               STOPS. Vanishes.

               There is an instant, ringing SILENCE, as awesome in its own 
               way as the roaring storm itself had been...

               WIDE ANGLE

               On the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, 
               pitter down, bouncing. Swirls of dust and sand drift away, 
               settling gently. The harsh orange landscape is once again 
               calm, peaceful.

               And then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear 
               another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               As McConnell finishes his message to Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Oh, and I talked to Debra. She and 
                         Bobby are doing fine. Said to tell 
                         you, they're, ah, they're on their 
                         "third time through the book, page --
                              (glances at a note)
                         -- page 125." They send their love 
                         and say take care of yourself. Same 
                         from us here, buddy. Till next time, 
                         then. End of transmission.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               MOVING ANGLE, the CAMERA EXPLORING ground zero, as the bass, 
               pulsing rumble continues...

               WE PASS the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater, 
               with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously 
               still with all four wheels...

               WE PASS faithful little ARES-8, lying on its side, partially 
               crushed under a boulder. It gives a final, pitiful WHINE, 
               its video snout slowly extending, then dies. And finally we 
               come to the area where the fissure had been, and see

               THE FISSURE HAS BEEN FILLED IN

               Leaving only a slender crease of umber sand. No sign of Luke. 
               The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see

               EXT. AERIAL VIEW. DAY

               An extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking 
               back down. Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow 
               crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and 
               rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face.

               The surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic. The 
               features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes, 
               slopes, ramps. The "eyes" -- hatches of some kind? -- are 
               closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but 
               terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask.

               We see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick, 
               scudding clouds OBSCURE it, but the deep, pulsing rumble 
               continues, low and insistent...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MARS TWO (DOCKED). COCKPIT. DAY

               We're inside the Mars Two spacecraft, which is still in its 
               docked position alongside the Space Station.

               Woody Blake, wearing a NASA jumpsuit, floats up into the 
               cockpit in Zero-G, studying a thick manual.

                                     WOODY
                              (reads)
                         "Problem: Hatch door malfunction, 
                         backup power fail, manual override 
                         fail. Solution: Replace circuit 
                         breaker 907B."

               He straps into the pilot's seat, staring at an electrical 
               junction box at one end of the console.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay... Piece of cake.

               He swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle 
               of fuses and wires. He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up 
               beside him, also in a jumpsuit, and straps into the co-pilot's 
               seat.

                                     WOODY
                         God, who dreams up these nightmares?

                                     TERRI
                         Don't try to change the subject.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm not! We're talking about your 
                         sister's wedding, right?

                                     TERRI
                         Very funny. We're talking about 
                         dancing lessons. Before my sister's 
                         wedding.

                                     WOODY
                         Honey, do you mind? I've got a 
                         catastrophic power failure here.

               He peers into the housing with exaggerated concern. But 
               Terri's not so easily sidetracked.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, we're a married couple. Would 
                         it kill you to invite me out on the 
                         floor once in awhile?

                                     WOODY
                         I danced with you at our wedding.

                                     TERRI
                         I'm not talking about shuffling your 
                         feet around while you grab my butt. 
                         I mean real dancing. Cha-cha, rhumba, 
                         jitterbug --

                                     WOODY
                         Face it, honey, some couples dance, 
                         some go to Mars. That's life.

                                     TERRI
                         I'm serious. We've got two more months 
                         in this training rotation, but just 
                         as soon as we get home, we're starting 
                         lessons. If we never dance, people 
                         will think there's something wrong.

                                     WOODY
                         If they see me dance, they'll know 
                         there's something wrong.

               Reaching past him, she pulls out the required breaker. As he 
               reacts, surprised, she smiles, despite her exasperation.

                                     TERRI
                         You are such a lug.

               Overhead, an intercom CRACKLES. We hear PHIL.

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         Cockpit, this is Control.

                                     TERRI
                         Control, this is Cockpit.

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         Uh, Terri, they want us all back in 
                         the Station. Report to Micker.

                                     TERRI
                         Who says report to Micker?

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         The little men who live in my head.

                                     WOODY
                         Phil, c'mon! We just started this 
                         drill.

                                     PHIL
                         Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told me 
                         to round up the team. Now.

               Woody and Terri exchange a worried look. What's wrong?

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               A crisis atmosphere prevails. The big room is more crowded 
               than we've ever seen it, with ENGINEERS and MANAGERS hurrying 
               by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering 
               feverishly into microphones.

               On the center screen, a giant image of Mars. A frantic flow 
               of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site 
               of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red.

               WOODY AND HIS CREW

               Are staring up at this screen, appalled. McConnell and Beck 
               stand nearby, briefing them.

                                     BECK
                         Then, at 1417, the X-band continuous 
                         data stream from Mars went silent. 
                         All data -- med, environmental, 
                         everything -- suddenly stopped. While 
                         we were trying to figure out what 
                         the hell went wrong, we got a signal 
                         from the folks at the Large Array at 
                         Soccoro.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At the same moment we lost the data 
                         stream, they picked up an intense 
                         burst of energy from Mars.

                                     WOODY
                         What do you mean, "intense"?

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (hesitates)
                         Catastrophic.

               Looks are exchanged among the Mars Two crew.

                                     TERRI
                         What about the crew?

                                     BECK
                         The level of energy in the pulse... 
                         didn't seem survivable.

                                     WOODY
                         What about the REMO? It went into 
                         Mars orbit last week. Maybe that 
                         could give us some clue.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Good thinking, Woody. That's just 
                         what we tried next.

               He leans over, punches buttons on a keyboard.

               ON THE CENTER SCREEN

               An orange dot can be seen in its orbital ellipse around Mars, 
               leaving a glowing electronic trail. This dot gets isolated 
               in a viewing box, then enlarged and rotated into the computer-

                         No instrument failures, no change in 
                         status. Orbit holding steady. But 
                         there was something else. The REMO'S 
                         computer contained an uplink message -- 
                         a very faint, highly distorted 
                         transmission from Mars One Base Camp.

               Black for a moment, then static. Out of this static comes a 
               faint image of Luke, sitting alone at the Hab kitchen table. 
               He looks awful -- dried blood on his face, bloodshot eyes. 
               The image is blurry, heavily streaked, and most of what he 
               says is lost in waves of static.

               a corridor, Phil pauses, seeing...

               At her desk. TWO CO-WORKERS are trying to comfort her. One 
               of these women looks up, and her reddened eyes meet...

               He looks back at her, haunted.

                         Luke must be in pretty bad shape if 
                         he hasn't blasted out of there in 
                         the Earth Return Vehicle. That thing's 
                         designed so even one crew member 
                         could fly it back to Earth.

                         couldn't get home. That energy pulse 
                         would've fried the ERV'S computers.

                         Other than the computers, how do we 
                         think the ERV fared?

                                     BECK
                         Well, so far our modelling says it 
                         should be in pretty good shape.

                         software to Mars. As fast as we can.

               McConnell looks at him, nods. They're on the same wavelength. 
               But Beck is more cautious.

                         weeks just to analyze this data.

                         Right, but meanwhile, we've gotta be 
                         working up a mission plan.

                         Luke may already be dead. And even 
                         if he's not, it's doubtful he's going 
                         to be able to transmit again. So we 
                         wouldn't know whether it's safe to 
                         land until you were almost there.

                         through the solar system. It could 
                         be retasked to take pictures, read

                         Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us 
                         Luke hasn't survived and it's not 
                         safe to land, we swing around Mars 
                         and come right back home.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yes. We can design the mission to 
                         have a free return capability. It's 
                         a long trip, but if you don't land 
                         it's the best option.

                         We're getting ahead of ourselves. 
                         You're forgetting the bigger problem.

                         The orbits are all wrong. Our first 
                         decent launch window is almost eight 
                         months from now.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         But we can go earlier and get there 
                         faster if we reconfigure the payload 
                         for extra fuel. We've modelled that, 
                         Ray. I've modelled it.

                         On paper, yeah. But those stresses 
                         have never been tested in space.

               A tense beat. Again we sense the test of wills between these 
               two tough-minded men, once good friends.

                         I know the protocols for a Mars 
                         Recovery Mission better than anybody, 
                         because I helped design them. And 
                         I'm saying these guys can do it.

                         0800 tomorrow. Then I'll put it in 
                         the works.

               He looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager.

                         Let's get to work.

               McConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck starts 
               out, too, Woody stops him.

                         What was his crime? That he was upset? 
                         That he cried...?

                                     BECK
                         I couldn't trust him!

               Beck and Woody stare at each other. A long tense beat.

                                     BECK
                              (his voice softer)
                         Not in a crisis... I'm sorry Woody, 
                         but Jim lost his edge. Are you gonna 
                         stand there and tell me Jim McConnell 
                         is the same man he was two years 
                         ago? You want me to bet four more 
                         lives on that?

               This stops Woody, just for a beat. Then makes him press on 
               harder, with even greater intensity.

                                     WOODY
                         When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked 
                         the shit out of him. It knocked the 
                         hell out of all of us. But you know 
                         and I know that he's still the best 
                         we've got. He and Maggie wrote the 
                         book on Mars. He's got more hours in 
                         the sims than the rest of us put 
                         together. Ray, we can do this. Give 
                         me McConnell as co-pilot, and we 
                         will bring Luke home. And that's a 
                         promise.

               Beck looks back at him, his features taunt.

               INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               Woody, Terri, and Phil stand at the edge of the big control 
               room, waiting and watching, in a tense silence, as

               IN THE DISTANCE, FROM THEIR POV

               Beck and McConnell are huddled together at the CAPCOM's 
               console. Other personnel have moved away, giving them room. 
               Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening 
               intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly. 
               After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise. His eyes search 
               the room till they find

               WOODY'S FACE

               Woody looks back at him, nods: C'mon, man. Take it.

               MCCONNELL'S OWN FACE

               Is a study in conflicting emotions. But after a moment he 
               masters his feelings, turns back toward Beck. A few more 
               quiet words are exchanged, then Beck offers his hand. 
               McConnell hesitates, then shakes it. Both men rise, and 
               McConnell turns again to look towards

               WOODY, TERRI, AND PHIL

               Who react with relief, glad that he's now a part of their 
               crew. Woody grins, giving him a thumb's up.

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE

               As he smiles. Then he starts towards them, with a new energy 
               in his step, a new sense of confidence and purpose. And as 
               he WALKS TOWARDS US, PASSING OUT OF FRAME...

               EXT. DEEP SPACE. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

               An infinite canopy of stars. After a moment, some of them 
               begin to be BLOTTED OUT as

               A SPACESHIP

               Glides INTO VIEW. "MARS RECOVERY" (formerly Mars Two) looks 
               much like its sister craft on Mars: a conical cockpit mounted 
               above a "tuna can" crew Hab module.

               SUPER TITLE: "MARS RECOVERY. MISSION DAY 172."

               The entire lower deck forms a segmented section of the hull 
               that rotates on bearings to provide artificial gravity; we 
               see window ports spinning past, then an American flag emblem.

               Behind this lower deck, in an extending network of struts, 
               like the abdomen of a dragonfly, are the three huge round 
               PROPELLANT TANKS. Then vast, delicate-looking rectangular 
               SOLAR PANELS, which sweep out to either side of the ship; 
               these also bear the dish of the earth-pointing HI-GAIN 
               ANTENNA. And finally comes the great mass of the ENGINE BELLS, 
               housed within a curving AEROSHELL; three hatches in the 
               aeroshell can open to allow the main thrusters to fire through 
               for a mid-course burn.

               CAMERA DRIFTS CLOSER

               To the forward section of the ship, APPROACHING a viewport 
               in the EVA airlock chamber. Inside, we can see Phil leaning 
               forward, concentrating on some task...

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY. A BUNCH OF M&MS

               Are floating in mid-air, forming an intricate 3D pattern. In 
               the EVA airlock, it's zero G.

               Phil, strapped into a chair by a galley counter, is just 
               completing this weightless puzzle by placing a final blue 
               M&M. He looks bored, sluggish. In the b.g., Terri is hunched 
               over a microscope.

               McConnell emerges from the core tunnel, behind them, coming 
               up from the lower Hab, then pushes off from the ladder, 
               floating towards Phil. He grins, admiring Phil's obsessive 
               handiwork.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What's that?

                                     PHIL
                         That... is the exact chemical 
                         composition of my ideal woman.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Used to be.

               He plucks out a couple of the M&Ms as he drifts by.

                                     PHIL
                         Hey!

               McConnell grins, snacking on the M&Ms.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Now what is it?

               Phil looks sadly at his floating model.

                                     PHIL
                         A frog.

               McConnell and Terri laugh as Phil starts scarfing down the 
               rest of the M&Ms. Swooping at them with both hands.

                                     TERRI
                         I guess now we have our answer to 
                         the effects of long-term 
                         interplanetary travel on the human 
                         mind. The answer is Phil.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (smiles)
                         I'm gonna get an update on SIMA. It 
                         should be just about close enough to 
                         start capturing some surface images.

               He's drifted to another short ladder, and now grabs it, starts 
               up to the cockpit, atop the Hab.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY

               As McConnell appears in the cockpit, he sees Woody by the 
               forward instrumentation panel, looking at a monitor. The 
               cockpit is also zero G.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Hey, Skip.

                                     WOODY
                         Take a look.

               McConnell pulls himself forward.

               ANGLE ON MONITOR

               MARS completely fills the screen. Surface details are clearly 
               visible. Something is moving down there, an amorphous brown 
               swirl.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY

                                     WOODY
                         What do you make of that?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Dust storm. Southern hemisphere, 
                         coming from the east... Big fella, 
                         too.

                                     WOODY
                         Headed for Chryse Planitia.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yup. Could get a little hairy just 
                         about landing time...

               McConnell pulls back from the screen, looks at Woody.

                                     WOODY
                         We'll have to be ready to move fast. 
                         Maybe even advance our ETA. Those 
                         things can cover the whole planet, 
                         and last up to a year.

               A beat. They both hope he's wrong.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         When does SIMA do her fly-by?

                                     WOODY
                         Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That's 
                         when we find out whether we came all 
                         this way for nothing.

               They exchange a glance. Woody's right, but the thought is 
               too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (softly)
                         My money's on Luke.

               INT. MARS RECOVERY. EVA AIRLOCK. NEXT MORNING

               CLOSE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK

               Just turning over to read "0545."

               TERRI

               Pulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her 
               redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night. Restlessly, 
               looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of 
               blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby 
               is her electron microscope.

               MCCONNELL (LOWER HAB)

               Lies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed. 
               The lower hab has artificial gravity (AG) and McConnell can 
               move normally. Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau.

               PHOTO OF A WOMAN

               Rests there, in its leather travel frame. Beautiful, smiling, 
               dark-haired: MAGGIE MCCONNELL. Her face glows with 
               intelligence and energy.

               MCCONNELL

               Shifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads "0546."

               PHIL (LOWER HAB)

               Stands in the communal bathroom, still in his pajamas, a 
               towel around his shoulders, brushing his teeth. He glances 
               at another digital clock, which reads "0547." Shakes his 
               head impatiently. He looks back into the mirror, then is 
               surprised to hear MUSIC lilting incongruously over the 
               loudspeakers: Elvis Presley's "Blue Moon."

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY

               Phil floats in through the connecting tunnel, then stops 
               himself at a handhold. He grins, charmed by the sight of

               WOODY AND TERRI DANCING

               Like a weightless Fred and Ginger. Woody is surprisingly 
               good at this. Enthusiastic, unselfconscious.

               He sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing 
               off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some 
               passable twirls and dips. She laughs, shaking her head.

                                     PHIL
                         What brought this on?

                         Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful. 
                         Once we're in Mars gravity, it's 
                         back to shuffling my feet and grabbing 
                         her butt.

                                     TERRI
                         I'll take what I can get.

               She grins, kisses his ear, as Phil turns, sees

               MCCONNELL

               Who has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple. A 
               twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes 
               meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile: 
               Aren't they something?

               Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER, 
               then an announcement.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Attention. Incoming packet.

               They all look at each other. This is it! Woody spins over to 
               a console, shuts off the music.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's SIMA.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY. MINUTES LATER

               The crew is gathered around a display screen. The lights are 
               dim, reflecting up off their faces. By their expressions, we 
               can tell the news is not good.

               CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

               It's a color, high-resolution satellite image of the Mars 
               One Base Camp. Ghostly, dust-covered. No signs of life.

                         Looks deserted.

                         It's still standing, though. So is 
                         the ERV. And look, there's the 
                         greenhouse.

                         We know Luke survived for at least a 
                         few hours. Question is, are there 
                         any signs of recent activity?

               They all scan the screen. Phil spots something.

                                     PHIL
                         There.

               He grabs a stylus and touches the screen. They all look. 
               CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

               Using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point, 
               the image enlarges. THREE LONGISH DIRT PILES appear, some 
               fifty meters from the hab.

                         What the hell are those?

               McConnell gets it first.

                         Graves.

               They all realize he's right. They sit back, stunned. But 
               then Phil has another thought.

                                     PHIL
                         Hold on. There's only three. That

                         No. It just means there was nobody 
                         left to bury him.

               This quiets everyone for a long moment.

               Phil keys in some commands and data pops up onscreen.

                         Go to the disaster site.

               Phil uses the stylus to bring MORE IMAGES into view. The 
               frame moves over the terrain in the direction of the Face, 
               first in SWIFT BLURS, then slowing. Scattered rock debris 
               come into view. The IMAGE ARRIVES where the mountain was, 
               and they see...

               Debris in every direction, NEAT SPIRALS of it now, dropped 
               uncannily into place, like some massive earth sculpture. As 
               if - but this makes no sense -- it had been swirled towards 
               a LARGE CRATER. The crater itself is a perfect circle. They 
               FOCUS on the CENTER OF THE CRATER, but the image gets 
               distorted by STATIC.

                         What's wrong?

                         I don't know. Magnetic interference?

               Phil tweaks the stylus, but the image won't clear up.

                         Must be a problem with SIMA. I don't 
                         see how an earthquake, six months 
                         ago, could give us this kind of 
                         distortion.

                         That was no quake.

               He leans closer, staring intently.

                         Then what the hell was it?

               McConnell shakes his head. But his every sense is engaged; 
               he's like a predator just sighting his prey for the first 
               time. We see in his eyes an utter determination to unlock 
               this secret.

               Mars Recovery is speeding ever closer to Mars, which now 
               looms large, a dusty red mysterious sphere.

               McConnell and crew are eating dinner while they watch a taped

               As Ray Beck addresses them. Other NASA STAFFERS, twenty or 
               more, have crowded in behind him, and we sense their great 
               hopefulness and high spirits; the whole team's triumph is 
               tantalizingly close now.

                         We're going to continue analyzing 
                         this data and try to determine what 
                         the problem is with those images. 
                         Frankly, we're just as stumped as 
                         you guys, but we'll keep on it.
                              (glancing around)
                         We agree that the evidence of the 
                         graves is inconclusive and that a 
                         ground search is advisable. Be aware 
                         there are little sand storms kicking 
                         up near Mars One Base, but the big 
                         one you spotted is turning south. It 
                         shouldn't be a factor.

               Beck takes a breath, smiles.

                                     BECK

                         we're sure you must be feeling the

               Terri and Phil are playing computer Monopoly under a single

               weeding out of the red ones. She shakes her head.

                         What if you opened up your meal packs 
                         and found that, instead of putting 
                         in everything but red ones, they'd 
                         made a mistake and put in only red

                         if in your meal packs, instead of 
                         brown rice, there were spring-loaded

               McConnell, in his cubicle, looks away from the photo of 
               Maggie. Haunted by memories. He rises, flips through the CDs 
               in a storage case, pulls one out. He holds this carefully, 
               hesitating, then feeds it into his computer. Immediately his

               HOME VIDEO OF A PARTY

               An impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a 
               semi-darkened living room. The footage is HANDHELD, a bit 
               jerky. People have paper plates of food, beers in hand, 
               everyone is a little tipsy. Debra is there, Terri, Phil, 
               Cote, Kirov, others. They're watching a STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE, 
               shown on a large screen TV, with commentary by Luke and Woody.

               THE FIRST PHOTO

               Is of a small boy (YOUNG MCCONNELL) in his pajamas, kneeling 
               in front of a Christmas tree. He's grinning ecstatically as 
               he holds up a brand new model rocket.

                         Jim's first ship was seriously 
                         underpowered...

               LAUGHTER at this. Some AD LIB CRACKS about the painfully bad 
               haircut and the pajamas.

               THE SECOND PHOTO

               Is of a gawky-looking teenage girl (YOUNG MAGGIE), standing 
               on a porch at night, posing a bit self-consciously by a 
               telescope on its tripod.

                         Maggie was always starstruck...

               More LAUGHTER, plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and 
               braces. VIDEOCAMERA swings around the room, REVEALING the 
               adult JIM and MAGGIE. They sit side by side on the hearth, 
               leaning into each other, looking very happy.

                                     MAGGIE
                         I'll get you guys for this.

               More LAUGHTER. Everyone's having a great time. The VIDEOCAMERA 
               swings back towards the TV screen as

               THIRD PHOTO APPEARS

               Jim and Maggie, young adults, standing on the wing of a 
               fighter jet. Both in Air Force flight suits, helmets in hand. 
               Suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles.

                         When they met at the Air Force 
                         Academy, it was "love at first 
                         flight."

               GROANS and LAUGHTER from the offscreen watchers.

                                     WOODY
                         After that, NASA training was tough. 
                         All Jim could think about was 
                         exploring a heavenly body. More ribald 
                         LAUGHTER, as

               FOURTH PHOTO APPEARS

               Maggie and Jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in 
               space suits.

                         But Maggie, as you can see, kept him 
                         on a short leash. Until...

               A FIFTH PHOTO

               Shows McConnell, in a dress uniform, leaning in to kiss 
               Maggie, who wears a white bridal gown.

                         Mission accomplished!

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, IN THE PRESENT

               As he smiles at this, hearing the renewed LAUGHTER and CHEERS, 
               the AD-LIBBED DIGS from the video. He becomes aware he's not 
               alone. He looks up.

               WOODY

               Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They 
               both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering.

               IN THE VIDEO

               Luke and Woody have stepped forward, INTO SHOT, standing at 
               the sides of the TV, where the last photo lingers. Luke waves 
               his hands, hushing everybody.

                                     LUKE
                         Today we celebrate a new chapter in 
                         their story. And guys, it's a pretty 
                         historic one.

               Both men raise champagne flutes.

                                     WOODY
                         Let's hear it for the newly-announced 
                         Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One. 
                         To Jim and Maggie!

               CHEERS at this, repeats of "Jim and Maggie!" Luke grins, 
               giving a little signal, and we see

               A FINAL PHOTO

               Of Maggie in Jim's arms, both of them in goofy tropical 
               vacation wear, smiling. Evidently a photo taken in the surf 
               somewhere, but here it's been crudely superimposed onto a 
               Martian landscape. Laughter greets this unlikely image.

                                     LUKE
                         When you guys land, it'll prove once 
                         and for all there's no intelligent 
                         life on Mars.

               More hoots of LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, but Maggie jumps in to 
               protest, as the VIDEOCAMERA SWINGS TO HER AND JIM. Terri 
               sits nearby.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Hey, c'mon, what if I'm right?

                         started! Somebody put on some music!

                                     MAGGIE
                         It's our sister planet!

                                     PHIL
                         Oh brother!

               LAUGHTER at this, and Maggie joins in. She's a good sport.

                                     TERRI
                         Maggie, why does this have to be 
                         about us? Mars is a great opportunity 
                         for pure science.

                                     MAGGIE
                         We'll do the science. And we'll do 
                         it very well. That's what we've 
                         trained for. But what if there's 
                         more...? In all our myths, in every 
                         human culture, Mars has always held 
                         a special attraction. What if that 
                         means something? Only we don't 
                         understand it yet...

               The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up 
               in Maggie's spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO 
               CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too.

                                     MAGGIE
                         The universe is not chaos. It's 
                         connection. Life reaches out for 
                         life...

               She looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand.

                                     MAGGIE
                         This is what we were born for, isn't 
                         it? To stand on a new world, and 
                         look beyond it to the next one. It's 
                         who we are.

               A silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her 
               passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn't 
               meant to get so carried away.

               He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat.

               Woody glances at him. It's true. Rather than being saddened, 
               McConnell seems to have taken on new strength. A renewed 
               sense of wonder.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         After all these years... Can you 
                         believe it? Tomorrow we'll be standing 
                         on Mars.

               Woody nods, smiles.

                                     WOODY
                         You know what? She may have been 
                         right.

               McConnell looks at him.

                                     WOODY
                         If that wasn't a quake down there, 
                         then something else caused it. Or 
                         planned it... You're thinking the 
                         same thing.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's never been out of my mind.

                                     WOODY
                         Jesus. You realize what this means?

               McConnell nods. Looks again at Maggie's face on the screen.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         She knew, Woody. She was the only 
                         one of us that ever thought there 
                         might be something down there.

                                     WOODY
                         Yeah, and we're not leaving until we 
                         find out... Deal?

               McConnell nods. They clasp hands briefly. Deal. Then Woody 
               turns. Before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning 
               back. One last thought, and he doesn't know he's going to 
               say it until it comes out.

                                     WOODY
                         Maggie was the best of us.

               McConnell looks at him, silent but grateful. Woody goes. 
               McConnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen on 
               the screen.

               INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

               MARS LOOMS AHEAD OF US.

               As seen through the cockpit windows. Huge, beautiful, MUCH 
               CLOSER now. We can make out swirling pink clouds, large 
               surface features. It's just before Martian dawn, the next

                         confirmation.

               There's a sudden LOUD, BRITTLE POP from somewhere overhead, 
               and Phil's gloved hand, hovering over a computer screen, is 
               punctured through and through. The screen itself is holed 
               and spiderwebbed with a loud CRACK!

                                     PHIL
                         Uhhh!

               PHIL HOLDS UP HIS HAND

               As he and Terri stare at it, dumbfounded. Thick droplets of 
               blood leak out and begin to swirl away, sucked up towards 
               the venting puncture in the hull over head. The astronauts' 
               helmets dangle up there, awaiting use.

                         What in God's --

               Suddenly we hear HIGH PITCHED ALARMS SOUNDING, then the 
               PINGING OF MORE TINY MISSILES, slashing across the ship's 
               outer skin.

               WOODY AND MCCONNELL

               Are staring back from the cockpit, reacting in astonishment 
               to Phil's drifting blood and to the alarms. Then Woody 
               suddenly understands.

               ANGLES ON TERRI AND PHIL

               As she seizes his wounded hand, tries to stop the bleeding. 
               He's staring at a gauge.

                                     PHIL

                         Woody, seal the breech!

               ANGLE ON WOODY

               As he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the 
               EVA, and floats quickly over to a storage hatch. He yanks 
               this open pulling out a

               PATCH GUN

               Then spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track

               THE RISING DROPLETS OF BLOOD

               Which give a telltale hint of the puncture's location, 
               somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the "ceiling."

               WOODY PUSHES OFF

               Rising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a 
               shattered faceplate -- its label reads "MCCONNELL" -- to 
               REVEAL A BREECH IN THE HULL. Jagged metal edges, dangling 
               insulation. The blood droplets are whirling out through here, 
               going into the vacuum of space.

               Quickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the 
               puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. We hear MORE PINGS, 
               ECHOING LOUDLY, but after a few seconds they DIMINISH, then 
               abruptly STOP. The KLAXONS continue to wail.

                                     WOODY
                         Kill those alarms!

               McConnell punches buttons, MUTING THE ALARMS, and they all 
               strain to listen, faces tense and sweating. A long beat. But 
               the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared. 
               The astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon.

               PHIL'S BLOOD DROPLETS

               Have stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in 
               the zero-G. Then suddenly they start moving again, faster 
               and faster, in a new direction. Down through the open core 
               tunnel that leads to the lower Hab.

               MCCONNELL

               Stares at a gauge that confirms what's happening.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Still outgassing in the lower Hab! 
                         There must be another hole down there, 
                         even bigger.

                                     PHIL

                         Positive! A vacuum inside the ship 
                         would cause a total electrical 
                         failure. The nav computers will fry!

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (to Woody)
                         We'll lose all control. We won't be 
                         able to fire the engines to capture 
                         Mars orbit.

               Just then a computer screen flickers, freezes. Phil punches 
               keys with his good hand. What he sees shocks him.

                                     PHIL
                         It's already starting. The primary L-
                         1 hub has been smashed. The systems 
                         are crashing.

               Woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more 
               calm than he really feels.

                         I'm going EVA.

               They stare at him, stunned by their immense task.

                                     WOODY

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. MOMENTS LATER

               Terri, now helmeted, is putting Woody's helmet on him, but 
               something's in the way, chafing his neck. He reaches into 
               his suit, pulls out...

               THE CHAIN

               From around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship 
               dangling.

               WOODY HANDS THIS TO TERRI

               As they share a brief, loving glance, but there's no time 
               for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his 
               gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards 
               the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock 
               switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look.

               At the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential 
               power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on 
               line. His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful.

                                     PHIL
                         Jesus, it's still bleeding.

               The outer airlock door is now open, revealing stars, as Woody 
               drifts through it into space. He's now wearing the MMU, an 
               oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle 
               astronauts.

               INT. EVA ROOM. NIGHT

               With its shattered faceplate -- now useless -- drifts past 
               Terri as she is wrapping med tape around gauze pads on Phil's 
               glove.

               MCCONNELL

               Floats up to them, checking on Phil's work at the computer.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim, you've gotta get your spare 
                         helmet from storage.

               McConnell looks at her, knows she's right. But he starts off 
               anyway. Phil reaches out his good hand.

                         Jim, I've got an idea. If you guys 
                         can save enough atmosphere, I'll 
                         disconnect the power in the main 
                         computer bay, then jump start the 
                         systems. I'll do a hard boot.

               This is a radical, incredibly risky notion. McConnell stares 
               hard at Phil. So does Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Has that ever been tested?

                         Are you kidding? These machines are 
                         much too valuable.

               McConnell looks from Terri to Phil. It's life and death.

                         Do it.

               Then he turns, and the CAMERA FOLLOWS MCCONNELL as he pushes 
               away from the console and dives down into the core tunnel, 
               heading towards the

               ...where he emerges from the core into the rotating Hab deck, 
               and pushes himself down a ladder toward the floor. He 
               accelerates as he gets closer to the floor, then rights 
               himself with a twist and lands on his feet -- now in gravity.

               Woody, in the MMU, is hovering over the lower segment of the 
               Hab hull, and right away we see his problem. He can't reach 
               the damaged spot because it's spinning past him, spewing 
               vapor.

               McConnell hears a sound up at the core tunnel. He turns, 
               it's Terri. She holds an small 0-2 cannister, marked with a 
               red cross.

               Attitude control thrusters on the hull begin firing in pulses. 
               The rotation of the lower Hab deck immediately starts to 
               slow down. The great red ball of Mars drifts by.

               Is also jarred by the firing of the thrusters. The rotation 
               slows until the Hab is still. Zero-G. McConnell floats. He 
               and Terri can hear the terrifying sound of air whistling out 
               into space through the breach hole.

               hand works a battery-powered screwdriver.

               He's removing the panel of the main computer bay. Over the

               The lower Hab deck is no longer revolving. Woody pops his

               McConnell locates a can of Dr. Pepper, shakes this violently, 
               then tosses it up to Terri, who's still in the tunnel mouth. 
               She catches the drifting can, confused. When McConnell speaks 
               again, he's gasping for air.

               Terri shakes out soda from the open can. She and McConnell 
               watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air, caught 
               by escaping oxygen. It rises towards the "ceiling" of the

               THE SODA STREAM

               Swirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that's now 
               being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull. She 
               can now see the ugly puncture for the first time.

               Terri turns, excited by McConnell's triumph; she's just in 
               time to see him collapse to the floor below her, as he starts 
               to lose consciousness. He's deathly pale.

               Woody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting 
               out of the hull of the lower Hab. It's some distance away

               Terri pushes off from the ladder, drifting weightlessly down 
               to McConnell. She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister, 
               pushing the plastic mask over McConnell's face. He sucks in 
               air, color returning to his skin as he revives.

               As he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer 
               bay. Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges 
               are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart, 
               streaking into electronic snow. He shoots a tense glance at

               closer to its critical MOI point, indicated by a flashing

               All of a sudden Woody's thrusters cut out. The ship is moving 
               by, a meter beneath him. Woody punches his arm controls. 
               Nothing.

               Then just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him, 
               the thrusters kick back in. Woody grabs the edge, starts to 
               move to the hole. Woody lets out a breath.

               to her, and together they push off from the floor, leaping 
               weightlessly up to the other side of the Hab, the "ceiling." 
               They reach the gaping puncture, which they now see has been

               Woody floats above the repaired hole, scanning the nearby 
               surface of the hull.

                                     WOODY
                         Jim, there's a lot of scarring... 
                         I'd better check for other punctures 
                         while I'm out here.

                                     MCCONNELL (V.O.)
                         Negative, negative. Woody, get back 
                         inside. We've gotta start the 
                         checklist for orbital insertion.

                                     WOODY
                              (a beat; reluctantly)
                         Copy, I'm heading there now.

               Woody jets back towards the open EVA hatch. But as he reaches 
               this, about to re-enter the ship, he's captured momentarily 
               by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him.

               SUNRISE OVER MARS

               As the huge planet is REVEALED in all its red, unearthly 
               glory. It's so close now that individual features can be 
               seen with the naked eye -- the vast chasm of Valles Marineris, 
               and then Olympus Mons, poking all the way up through the 
               Martian atmosphere. A stunning, alluring spectacle.

               WOODY

               Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side 
               of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a very 
               long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath.

                                     WOODY
                         Hey, Beautiful...

               Then he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through 
               the EVA hatch.

               CAMERA DRIFTS QUICKLY BACK and down along the hull as stark 
               sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks, three in a 
               row, and the thick silver tubes that join them. There's a 
               good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower. 
               Then, as the ship begins to MOVE OUT OF FRAME...

               WE MOVE IN CLOSER

               On one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we 
               see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of 
               the eraser at the end of a pencil. So small, so apparently 
               harmless...

               As Woody enters, stripped from the MMU, dripping with sweat, 
               McConnell is waiting for him. For a moment the two men just 
               look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce 
               hug.

                                     WOODY

                         Know what? You've got enough left.

               McConnell looks at him, understands.

               Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up 
               Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat 
               and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.

                                     TERRI

                         Well. Easier than the cha-cha.

               He scoops her into his arms; they kiss passionately.

               Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own 
               eyes. His voice catches for a moment.

                                     PHIL
                         I don't know what you're getting so 
                         cocky about. We scored better times 
                         in the sim at least twice.

                                     MCCONNELL

               Terri separates from Woody, looks down at Phil.

                         Seems OK. Couple of the tendons are 
                         going to be a little tight for awhile. 
                         Try to close your fingers, Phil, 
                         nice and slowly.

               Phil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit remains 
               extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this 
               for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully.

                                     PHIL
                         Well, at least I'll still be able to 
                         drive.

               After a split-second they get it, and the whole crew roars 
               with LAUGHTER, which builds and builds; they're almost giddy 
               with the relief of the tension...

               great ship maneuvers into position for its orbital-capture 
               burn. Mars looks very large, blood-red. The entire spectacle 
               is majestic, awe-inspiring.

               He flips three switches, in rapid sequence, and...

               EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

               As we MOVE IN on the damaged fuel line, we see a tiny but 
               steady spray of fuel venting from the hole caused by the 
               meterorite. This freezes into eerie streamers and chunks, 
               which slowly drift away from the ship. They're quite 
               beautiful.

               Woody looks at the others for moment -- everyone is set, 
               looking good -- then reaches for a last switch.

                                     PHIL

               Woody hesitates, then glances at McConnell.

                         Jim?

               McConnell, moved by this honor, nods. He reaches out to throw 
               the switch himself.

                         Let's go to Mars.

               As the countdown indicator reaches "0000.00.00", a final 
               signal PINGS, and he flips the switch.

               EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

               In total silence, the engines ignite. The second they do, 
               the streamers of frozen fuel explode in a white flash.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY

               With alarms sounding, the four astronauts are slammed 
               violently forward, against their restraints.

               He and Woody both reach out, straining against the incredible 
               G-forces, and manage to grab a red emergency lever, yanking 
               it down hard.

               EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

               Too late! IN SLOW MOTION, we see a terrifyingly violent chain 
               reaction. The fuel tanks themselves explode, one after 
               another. The supporting metal struts are vaporized. The solar 
               panels are snapped off. Two of the huge engine bells are 
               smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing 
               pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off, PAST CAMERA, like 
               a flaming cannon ball. The entire aft section of the ship, 
               including much of the lower Hab, instantly becomes a shredded, 
               charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes 
               what's left of the ship -- mainly the EVA chamber and cockpit -- 
               to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards Mars.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY

               In the windows, Mars goes crazily in and out of view. The 
               astronauts, flung this way, then that, are all fighting 
               against unconsciousness.

               From further away, the charred remainder of the ship can be 
               seen spinning down towards Mars, which now fills the screen, 
               looming as large as Earth, when seen from the space shuttle. 
               The ship's motion is mercifully slowing as it hits the outer 
               atmosphere, but just as clearly this steep, unplanned angle 
               of entry dooms it.

               All four astronauts fire a brief, simultaneous burst from 
               the tiny attitude control thrusters in their suits. This 
               stops their rotation, bringing their travel under control.

               The only home they've known for six months. He exchanges a 
               silent glance with the others. They all expect to be dead in

               from the ship. The cord between Woody and the others pulls 
               taut and they start to follow.

               WIDE SHOT

               Of Woody leading them away from the crippled spaceship, 
               against the magnificent backdrop of the blood-red planet 
               below. Four tiny figures, all alone in space.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS

               As Phil looks back, his eyes searching the stars.

                                     TERRI
                         What're you looking for?

                                     PHIL
                              (softly, sadly)
                         Earth.

                                     TERRI
                              (beat)
                         Hey. When we get back? We really 
                         will have to try this in the sim.

               He tries to smile. So does she.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How we doin' on fuel, Woody?

               Woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm at fifty percent.
                              (looking down)
                         But I don't see the REMO.

               THEIR POV

               Everyone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black 
               space, expecting to see the REMO coming up behind them.

               TERRI

               Happens to glance directly below.

                                     TERRI
                         There she is!

               THEIR POV

               The black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against 
               the red of Mars.

                                     WOODY
                         Jesus. She's not where I thought 
                         she'd be.

                                     PHIL
                         We're going to miss her.

               WOODY

               Looks again at his display screen, frustrated.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What do you think?

                                     WOODY
                         We can't catch it. Not like this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (thinking quickly)
                         Use the tether.

               From a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls out...

               THE TETHER GUN

               About the size of a large flare gun. There's a carabiner-
               like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We'll only have one, maybe two shots 
                         before she's out of reach.

                                     WOODY
                         It'll be better if I leave you the 
                         gun while I run out to the REMO. 
                         I've got enough fuel left for that.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You'll be going too fast.

                                     WOODY
                         I'll aim to overshoot, then brake 
                         like hell; arc it in.

               McConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is, 
               and they also know it's their only chance. Woody flips a 
               switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes, 
               trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hands 
               McConnell the gun.

                                     WOODY
                         Seeya in a few.

               McConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender, 
               loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets at 
               full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the 
               tether gun.

               WOODY AND THE REMO

               Woody is chasing the REMO from above. It's as if he were in 
               an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway. 
               Woody is picking up speed quickly. Maybe too quickly. He 
               checks his armpad display screen.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay. I'm on path to overshoot. I'm 
                         gonna take the edge off.

               Woody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he 
               can.

               CLOSE ON THE THRUSTERS

               Glowing with orange flame. They suddenly cut off.

               WOODY'S EYES

               Show alarm. He checks his display.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm out. Coming in hot. Still long.
                              (beat)
                         Abandoning the unit. I'll brake with 
                         suit jets.

               Woody hits some buttons and the MMU's latches snap open. He 
               grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes 
               himself free of the MMU, starts firing his small suit jets.

               WOODY'S POV

               He's still going very quickly.

               WITH MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               Floating close together. The tether line is still unspooling 
               from the gun. They watch Woody, below and ahead of them, as 
               he races towards the REMO. Terri's heart is in her throat.

                                     TERRI
                         Oh Jesus. Jesus...

               McConnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm.

               BACK ON WOODY

               Still speeding towards the REMO. His suit jets cut out.

                                     WOODY
                         Suit jets gone. But I'm gonna make 
                         contact...

               MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               Stare at Woody's distant figure.

               INTERCUT --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At what velocity?

                                     WOODY
                         Impact's gonna be a little rough.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At what velocity?

                                     WOODY
                              (beat)
                         Thirty-two.

               A look between McConnell and Terri; her face is stricken.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm gonna use the gun to slow you.

                                     WOODY
                         No! You slow me and I'll fall short.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's too fast, Woody.

                                     WOODY
                         No choice. I'll be okay. Here we 
                         go...

               WOODY AND THE REMO

               Woody's coming down on the module at over thirty kilometers 
               an hour. He holds the hook out in front of him with one hand 
               while grabbing the tether line with the other, and WHAM! -- 
               he crashes into the REMO.

               WOODY'S HAND

               Slams the hook against a receiver on the hull of the REMO.

               IT CONNECTS --

               WOODY

               Tries to hold onto the tether line but his momentum is too 
               much.

               HIS GLOVED HANDS

               Are ripped from the line.

               WOODY

               Slides over the hull of the REMO.

               HIS HANDS

               Grasp in vain for something to grab onto. They drag and bump 
               and then finally his fingers close on... empty space.

               WOODY

               Is past the REMO, freefalling toward Mars.

               BACK ON MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               As Terri screams.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody!!

               McConnell hits a button on the tether gun and starts to reel 
               them quickly in towards the REMO.

               WOODY

               Tries his suit jets again -- they're empty.

               HIS POV

               Falling away from the REMO.

               MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS

               Are being reeled towards the REMO by the tether line. Another 
               couple hundred meters to go.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Woody, what's your status?

               INTERCUTTING --

                                     WOODY
                              (after a beat)
                         Uh, well, no suit jets and I'm still 
                         carrying a good deal of velocity.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         As soon as we get hooked up, I'll 
                         come get you.

                                     WOODY
                              (after a beat)
                         Uh, I'd have to say negative on that, 
                         Jim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Negative on the transmission?

                                     WOODY
                         No, I heard you. Negative on the 
                         maneuver. I am not retrievable.

               McConnell and Terri share a quick, anguished look.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, that's not possible. You're 
                         not going that fast.

                                     WOODY
                         It comes down to the amount of fuel, 
                         honey. The suit jets were designed 
                         for attitude control, not travel. 
                         Retrieval just won't work.

                                     PHIL
                         It has to work!

                                     WOODY
                         Hey, believe me, I don't like it any 
                         more than you do.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody --

                                     WOODY
                         Run the numbers, Jim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I am.

               McConnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display 
               pad. Terri is staring at him. When McConnell's eyes meet 
               hers, they are red-rimmed. Haunted.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Woody, you hang tight. We'll get 
                         into the REMO, fire her up, drop her 
                         into a lower orbit and come scoop 
                         you up.

                                     WOODY
                         Sounds good, Jim.

                                     TERRI
                         It's gonna take half an hour to get 
                         the REMO reoriented! Woody'll be... 
                         He'll be in the atmosphere by then!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Then we'll have to get her moving 
                         faster.

                                     TERRI
                         We don't have time!

                                     WOODY
                         You listen to Jim, honey. It's a 
                         good plan.

                                     TERRI
                         No! We are going to --

                                     PHIL
                         Oh Jesus, look! The ship!

               Phil points. McConnell and Terri look.

               THE MARS RECOVERY COCKPIT

               Is now several kilometers below and behind them. It's glowing 
               red... then orange... then white. Then it erupts into a giant 
               fireball, devoured by friction with Mars' atmosphere.

               MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL IN DEEP SPACE

               Are all staring at this, awed, when McConnell happens to 
               look up again. He sees something alarming.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Look out!

               THEIR POV

               They are drifting quickly into the REMO.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Brakes!

               ALL THREE

               Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang 
               into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They 
               find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the 
               tether gun.

               THE HOOK

               Releases from the REMO's hull. McConnell hits another button 
               and it is reeled all the way into the gun. Phil is already 
               scrabbling at a latch on the REMO's outer airlock door.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Okay, let's get inside! Phil, start 
                         dumping the cargo, or there won't be 
                         room for us.

                                     PHIL
                         But we need those supplies for --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody!

               WOODY

               Is looking back at the REMO. Smiles with relief to see that 
               Terri has reached it safely.

                                     WOODY
                         Will do, Jim.

               He turns to look at...

               MARS

               Right below him, filling his field of view. A long beat.

                                     WOODY
                              (softly)
                         Hey, Beautiful...

               BACK AT THE REMO

               Terri makes a snap decision. She grabs the tether gun from 
               McConnell's surprised hands, then pushes off from the REMO. 
               McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, no!

               But it's too late. She's already out of reach, and now fires 
               her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the REMO.

               MCCONNELL

               Is reaching to activate his own jets, when

               PHIL'S HAND

               Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They 
               stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half-
               maddened, agonized, staring after Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Goddammit, Terri, it won't work!

               But Terri keeps on going.

               WOODY

               Looks back at the REMO, as he continues to fall towards Mars. 
               Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri, what are you doing?

               INTERCUT --

                                     TERRI
                         I'll tell you what I'm not doing, 
                         Woody. I'm not going to watch you 
                         die.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri --

                                     TERRI
                         You'd do the same for me.

               AT THE REMO

               Phil is watching as Terri drops towards the distant twinkle 
               of Woody's suit lights. The airlock door hangs open. Phil 
               looks at McConnell, anguished.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Get inside. Dump the cargo, then 
                         start the systems.
                              (Phil hesitates)
                         Now.

               INTERCUTTING BETWEEN WOODY AND TERRI

               As Woody keys his mike. Tries to steady his voice.

                                     WOODY
                         No. I wouldn't come for you. Not if 
                         it just wasn't possible.

                                     TERRI
                         I can do it!

                                     WOODY
                         No, Terri, you can't! You don't have 
                         enough fuel to get me, stop us both, 
                         and get us back. Hell, you come any 
                         farther and you won't have enough to 
                         get back yourself.

               No response from Terri.

                                     WOODY
                         Listen to me, goddammit! You have to 
                         stop! You have to stop now!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He's right, Terri... It's no use.

               Terri looks at her armpad display.

               CLOSE ON DISPLAY SCREEN

               As her fuel indicator drops from 50 percent to 49 to...

               TERRI

               Releases her thumb from the toggle control.

               HER SUIT JETS

               Stop firing.

               TERRI

               Drifts, staring towards Woody.

               TERRI AND WOODY

               Are on the same trajectory, going the same speed, and only 
               about a hundred meters apart. But it might as well be 
               infinity.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay, honey...? You gotta go back 
                         now.

                                     TERRI
                         The hell I do.

               Terri raises up the tether gun and pulls the trigger.

               THE HOOK

               Comes shooting out of the gun, wire spooling out behind it.

               WOODY

               Watches as it comes shooting down toward him.

               PLATE POV -- MOVING -- AS

               Woody gets larger and larger, the hook gets closer and closer, 
               and then SNAP! -- the hook stops. ANGLE ON THE TETHER GUN

               The wire has run all the way out.

               WOODY

               Looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away from 
               him. His only life preserver.

               TERRI

               Hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into 
               the gun.

                                     WOODY
                         What are you doing?

                                     TERRI
                         I'm gonna jet a little closer and 
                         try again.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri, you spend any fuel getting 
                         closer, you won't get back, and if 
                         anyone tries to get you, they'll die 
                         too.

               No response from Terri.

               THE HOOK

               Is whipping back toward Terri and the gun. Woody's voice 
               cracks; he's very close to tears. Pleading now.

                                     WOODY
                         Honey, please go back. Go back and 
                         help everyone get down to the surface.

               The hook slams back against the muzzle of the gun. Terri 
               resets the gun quickly, in an anguished fury.

                                     TERRI
                         I am not losing you.

                                     WOODY
                         I can't let you do it. I can't. I'm 
                         sorry.

               TERRI

               Looks at Woody, two hundred meters away, sensing something 
               different in his voice now, a terrible resolve...

                                     TERRI
                         Woody...?

               WOODY

               Raises his hands to his helmet ring. His eyes shining.

                                     WOODY
                         I love you, Terri. God how I love 
                         you.

               He unscrews the ring, pops the seal. The outrush of air pushes 
               his helmet all the way off. Woody shuts his eyes and opens 
               his mouth.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, nooooooo...!!!

               Ice crystals bloom with Woody's last breath. There's nothing 
               to suck in. He doesn't fight it. He lets death come.

               ANGLE ON TERRI

               Tears streaming, chest heaving, frantic.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, oh Woody, please God, no!

               HER THUMB

               Hovers over her suit jet toggle control. McConnell's voice, 
               from the distance, sounds very tired. Like he's aged fifty 
               years in the blink of an eye.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Come back, Terri.

               Terri's thumb is still poised. Death would be better.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL

               Outside the REMO. The hatch is still open. We see Phil inside, 
               staring out anxiously towards Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (quietly, simply)
                         He's gone.

               He sees no movement from the distant, small figure of Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Please, Terri...
                              (long beat)
                         We need you.

               TERRI'S THUMB

               Pushes the toggle control... to one side, not forward.

               TERRI'S FACE

               Inside her helmet, is streaming with tears. She turns herself 
               around, reluctantly. Heads slowly back towards the REMO.

               INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               On the big screen at MMCR, a glowing green icon labelled 
               "MARS RECOVERY" is shown in orbit, as a stream of computer 
               figures crawls beside it.

               SUPER TITLE: "SPACE STATION. MMCR. 20 MINUTE TIME LAG"

               Beck stands by the NEW CAPCOM, as the latter repeats headset 
               data.

                                     NEW CAPCOM
                         Okay, they're Go for the burn and 
                         MOI. Should be initiating the burn 
                         just about... now.

               Suddenly the data stream goes crazy. It shivers, streaks, 
               breaks up... then stops. The blinking green icon representing 
               Mars Recovery glows brighter... then vanishes.

               A moment of stunned silence in the big room. Then a rising 
               babble of scared, confused voices.

               RAY BECK

               Takes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen. His 
               face goes pale, stricken. His worst nightmare is taking place, 
               right before his eyes -- and for the second mission in a 
               row...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

               The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes, 
               packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. 
               The hatch is sealed.

               INT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

               McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by 
               the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome 
               his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate 
               on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has 
               been opened; he's facing

               SMALL UTILITY MONITOR

               Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator 
               lights, com ports.

               MCCONNELL

               Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a 
               palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins 
               tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He 
               turns, looking back at

               TERRI AND PHIL

               Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land. 
               They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this 
               tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned 
               operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold.

               PHIL'S FACE

               Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and 
               fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer 
               supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.

               TERRI

               Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock.

               MCCONNELL

               Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil?
                              (no response)
                         Hey, Phil...?

               Phil looks up at him dully.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're going in blind. We'll deploy 
                         the chutes by laptop. I need to get 
                         on the data bus, put in a software 
                         patch, and try to soften this tin 
                         can's landing. I could use your help 
                         with the patch.

               After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards 
               McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, 
               then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to 
               tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's great. Good job.
                              (turning to Terri)
                         Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think 
                         maybe we could rig some kind of 
                         seatbelts out of those cargo straps?

               Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her 
               hand, as if she's never seen it before. Dully she reaches 
               for another one, begins looping them together.

               MCCONNELL

               Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't 
               push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots, 
               but at least they're moving.

               EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT. (MINUTES LATER)

               Small thrusters are firing, getting the REMO into position 
               for entry into the atmosphere.

               Then all the jets fire in unison, braking the REMO, as it 
               falls away from us, towards Mars at night.

               INT. REMO. HIGH ATMOSPHERE. NIGHT

               The astronauts, restrained on the floor by Terri's jury-rigged 
               strap system, hold on for dear life. The buffeting through 
               the atmosphere is shaking them violently.

               BEHIND THEIR FACEPLATES

               We see the effect of the incredible g-forces: faces distorted, 
               unable to focus their eyes. Each of them thinking, once again: 
               Now I'm going to die...

               The Mars One Base Camp looms in the foreground, like some 
               desolate, otherwordly ghost town. And then, in the night sky 
               beyond it, we see an eerie and beautiful sight: a bright 
               streak of red as the REMO slashes down into the Martian 
               atmosphere, like a shooting star, finally disappearing behind 
               distant mountains. Then all is stillness again, deathly 
               stillness and silence...

               INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. VIEWPORT. DAY

               Beck stands by a viewport, staring out into space. He's just 
               lost four good friends, and also knows he is seeing, in this 
               disaster, the probable end of the Mars Program, and the 
               certain end of his own career. He doesn't, at first, even 
               hear the nearby VOICE.

                                     NEW CAPCOM
                         Ray...? We've got some new data, 
                         just coming in.

               Beck looks up, his eyes red-rimmed. The CapCom shifts 
               uneasily. He's holding a computer printout.

                                     NEW CAPCOM
                         We just -- it doesn't make any sense. 
                         We're not sure how to read this.

                                     BECK
                         Data?

                         Yes sir. Telemetry reports the REMO 
                         has left its orbit and reached the 
                         Martian surface.

                                     BECK
                              (pause)
                         Crashed?

                         No sir. Under power.

               Beck snatches the paper, staring at it. For the first time 
               we see some life coming back into him.

                                     BECK
                         When?

                                     NEW CAPCOM
                         Sixty-three minutes after Mars 
                         Recovery went off-line. Sir, the 
                         graph reads like a controlled descent. 
                         But that doesn't make any --

               Beck suddenly understands. And it's a joy to see his face, 
               the tears of happiness that spring into his eyes.

                                     BECK
                         They used the REMO as a lander.

               The CapCom stares back at him, feeling the same surge of 
               hope.

                                     BECK
                         It's McConnell, it's got to be! Nobody 
                         else could have pulled this off. Son 
                         of a bitch! They're alive.

               EXT. MARTIAN SURFACE. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

               POV ANGLE - WIDE

               As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still. In the 
               distance, the massive ERV still looms, perched for takeoff, 
               the bottom rungs of its ladder buried.

               PANNING

               We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well 
               as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse, 
               and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant 
               are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by 
               micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze. 
               And finally,

               CLOSER TO CAMERA

               We see the camp's American flag, still on its toppled pole, 
               but nearly obliterated by sand.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, TERRI, AND PHIL

               Who are spooked by this desolation. They've paused at the 
               edge of the camp.

               They have dragged along with them from their landing site a 
               crude sledge, improvised from the REMO's hatch cover and 
               some cargo straps. On this, their meager supplies.

               McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he's got to keep 
               their spirits up. He kneels, digs out the flag pole. Brushing 
               off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the 
               ground, packing the sand down with his boot. He stands for a 
               moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist. Despite the cost, 
               they have made it to Mars.

               When he turns, Terri and Phil are looking at him, moved.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Better?

                                     PHIL
                              (pause)
                         Damn right.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, let's see if that oxygen still 
                         is operational. Phil, you better 
                         check out the ERV. I'll take the 
                         Hab. If you find Luke's --

               He catches himself. Phil and Terri look at him.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Just keep in touch.

               EXT. ERV. DAY

               Phil steps from the umber sand onto the ERV's ladder, begins 
               to climb. The four-man rover is nearby, sand drifted high 
               against its tires.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri kneels by the oxygen still, begins to scoop away sand 
               with her gloved hands. She still looks numb.

               EXT. HAB. DAY

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (on radio)
                         I'm at the main airlock door.

               He unlatches a panel, grips the emergency lever inside, tugs 
               it. After a seeming eternity, the door groans and creaks 
               open. Little puffs of dust and sand swirl about, settle.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Entering Hab.

               EXT. ERV. DAY

               Perched atop the ERV's ladder, Phil, using a battery-powered 
               drill, is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover. 
               He lifts off the heavy cover, lets it tumble to the sand.

                                     PHIL
                         I've got ERV access. I'm going in. 
                         Terri, you okay?

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri is still scooping sand. She's just cleared the first 
               row of gauges.

                                     TERRI
                         Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to 
                         get back to 100% capacity.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell walks through the kitchen, which we recognize. He 
               pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew 
               taped their final, fateful message.

               HIS BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE

               Still sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle. 
               Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the 
               corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins, 
               startled, and sees

               HIS OWN REFLECTION.

               In his white pressure suit, staring back at him from the 
               screen of a video monitor. Above this is perched the camera 
               the Mars One astronauts used for their comm packets.

               MCCONNELL SHIVERS

               This place is filled with ghosts.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil, in the pilot's seat of the ERV, pushes a computer's 
               power button. The screen flickers weakly to life, startling 
               him a bit, but all he sees on it are white streaks, crazy 
               static.

                                     PHIL
                         ERV appears structurally intact. 
                         Computers are fried, just as we 
                         thought.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri has cleared more gauges, valves. She sits back on her 
               heels, studying the tangle of pipes.

                                     TERRI
                         Copy that. I've got busted filters 
                         here, clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup 
                         job, but so far no major damage.

               INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

               AN INNER AIRLOCK DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, AND MCCONNELL ENTERS. 
               THEN STOPS, ASTONISHED. HIS POV

               On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants 
               have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are 
               even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on 
               the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through 
               pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever 
               assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.

               MCCONNELL

               Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up 
               before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication, 
               he looks down at his forearm instrument pad.

               Blinking red letters read "25 deg. C." And something else -- 
               the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly 
               deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in 
               here!

               MCCONNELL

               Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout:

               "Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%."

               MCCONNELL

               Slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He 
               hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful 
               of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment 
               he doesn't trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards 
               his helmet.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm in the greenhouse. You better... 
                         you better come see this for 
                         yourselves.

               INT. ERV. DAY

               Phil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns. Through 
               a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse.

                                     PHIL
                         What is it?

               There's no answer. He rises.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri rises, concerned, and turns. Through the distant, 
               translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure 
               can be seen, moving slowly.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim...?

               INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

               McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing 
               through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping 
               foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he 
               looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, 
               jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has 
               come into play. He pauses, looking up...

               Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic 
               tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in 
               the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water 
               wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with 
               duct tape, like some giant Erector set.

               As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged 
               figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with 
               a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground.

               McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights 
               back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as 
               he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a 
               glimpse of the almost unrecognizable

               LUKE GRAHAM

               Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying 
               curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above 
               a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together. 
               In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high 
               overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. 
               McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, it's me! Jim McConnell!

               We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yanks 
               his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles 
               in the air.

                                     LUKE
                         You're not here!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, it's Jim!

                                     LUKE
                         No, no, you're not... you can't be 
                         here.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Your wife is Debra! Your son is Bobby! 
                         You were reading Treasure Island 
                         with him...!

               As he stares down at McConnell, Luke's eyes finally light up 
               with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized from 
               behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped 
               from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms. McConnell 
               scrambles to his feet.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Don't hurt him!

               McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil 
               that it's okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling off 
               their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath.

               Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after 
               another, as if still not quite certain whether they might 
               vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.

                                     LUKE
                         Phil... Terri...

               Luke looks with incomprehension at McConnell.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim... I don't understand. You're 
                         not supposed to be here... Why are 
                         you here? Where's Woody?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He didn't make it Luke.

               Luke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything. He 
               looks to Terri, who looks down.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh no.

               Luke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on 
               himself. It's all too much for him to take in. McConnell 
               kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him.

               INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE GREENHOUSE. DAY (MINUTES LATER)

               Luke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented 
               sleeping area he's created in one corner of the greenhouse. 
               Nearby, his hotplate, pots, and some freshly harvested 
               vegetables and greens. The others crouch around him.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, what happened here?

               A flash of fear in Luke's eyes.

                                     LUKE
                              (whispers)
                         We fired the radar. It came. They 
                         all died.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What came?

                                     LUKE
                         They all died, but I was spared. 
                         Why? Had to be for a reason. Then, 
                         all of a sudden, I knew why I was 
                         spared.

               His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper.

                                     LUKE
                         So somebody would be left to figure 
                         out the secret.

               He taps his forehead, significantly, then nods once or twice. 
               The others exchange an uneasy glance.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, we still don't understand.

                                     LUKE
                         Come. Comecomecome.

               He rises quickly and scuttles off, waving an impatient hand, 
               without waiting to see if they'll follow. McConnell, Terri 
               and Phil stare after him for a long moment. Phil breaks the 
               silence.

                                     PHIL
                         Is it just me? Or is he about two 
                         mealpacks short of a picnic?

                                     TERRI
                         Long term exposure to low gravity 
                         can have an adverse impact on the 
                         brain. He could be suffering from a 
                         form of asphyxia.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Or maybe his whole crew died and 
                         he's been marooned alone on Mars. 
                         Let's give him time to adjust.

               McConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went. Phil, 
               trailing, mutters to himself.

                                     PHIL

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

               Luke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking 
               helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised 
               sledge, with its meager supplies. McConnell, Terri, and Phil 
               walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. They hear 
               Luke over his RADIO.

                                     LUKE
                         So... let me be sure I understand 
                         this. Your ship blew up, with all 
                         its supplies. Then you emptied the 
                         cargo out of the REMO, and it was 
                         totalled on landing. You've got no 
                         food, no water, no spare oxygen, 
                         nothing but what I see here...?

               McConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. Then 
               McConnell nods. Luke looks at him, a cracked grin.

                                     LUKE
                         What kinda rescue mission is this?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That kind.

               He points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it off 
               a sledge. Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         Check it out. New nav boards for the 
                         ERV. I got four round-trip tickets, 
                         baby, right in here.

                                     LUKE
                              (softly)
                         Four.

               In some mysterious way, this reminder of Woody's death seems 
               to bring him fully back into himself. He takes Terri by the 
               shoulders, deeply saddened. She meets his gaze.

                                     LUKE
                         Terri... I'm so sorry. He was a good 
                         man.

                                     TERRI
                         Thanks, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         When there's time, we'll talk.

               She nods, grateful. A beat. He looks at the others.

                                     LUKE
                         This way.

               He starts off across the sand, and they follow.

               EXT. GRAVE SITE. DAY

               They stand looking down at the three long mounds of dirt, as 
               Luke completes his account of the disaster.

                                     LUKE
                         ...When I came to and dug myself out 
                         of the sand, my faceplate was cracked. 
                         Leaking badly. I barely made it back 
                         to Base. It was weeks before I could 
                         work up the nerve to go back out 
                         there and look for their...

               He has to pause, collect himself.

                                     LUKE
                         Renee was the only one I could find. 
                         But it didn't seem right, somehow, 
                         to dig just one grave.

               There is an emotional silence. Luke turns, takes a few steps. 
               He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust 
               around them. McConnell hesitates, notices Luke's gaze.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Has it been blowing like this for a 
                         while?
                              (Luke nods)
                         We saw a big storm from space. But 
                         Micker said it was turning south.

               Luke looks off into the distance, studies something only he 
               seems to see.

                                     LUKE
                         If it holds course.

               McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at 
               Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         This -- whatever it was -- this force. 
                         You say it came directly out of the 
                         top of the mountain?

                                     LUKE
                         You don't believe me. That's okay. 
                         But I'm not crazy, Jim.

               McConnell isn't quite sure how to reply to this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What did you mean by its "secret?" 
                         What secret?

                                     LUKE
                              (pause)
                         You better see for yourselves.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell, Terri, and Phil follow Luke into the Science Lab 
               area of the Hab, then stop in their tracks. Their helmets 
               are off. It's very cold in here; their breath is frosty.

               THEIR POV --

               The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many 
               locations, all tagged and labelled. There are drawings and 
               diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated 
               maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of 
               the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew.

                                     LUKE
                         See, where they made their mistake 
                         was, they must've planned for it to 
                         be visible from Earth...

               The others turn, looking at him. Luke is aiming an electric 
               space heater at his computer. As the coils glow red, he rubs 
               his hands together, poised over the keyboard.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Who's "they"?

               Luke reacts to their blank stares. He has a kind of jittery 
               feverish intensity, a secret excitement.

                                     LUKE
                         Don't you understand? Hundreds of 
                         millions of years have gone by. You've 
                         got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, 
                         meteor impacts -- hell, in that much 
                         time, the whole surface would've 
                         changed. So no wonder we never saw 
                         it before. Well, I mean, we saw it, 
                         but not like they meant us too. Too 
                         much dirt on it.

               The others exchange worried glances. Is he totally nuts?

                                     TERRI
                         Saw what?

                                     LUKE
                         This.

               On the computer screen they're looking at...

               Pictures of the Face after the disaster, seen from ground-
               level, in telephoto views. Rising out of a ring of rock and 
               dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic face. 
               The white is smooth, impenetrable. It has the scale of a 
               mountain, but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural.

               MCCONNELL, PHIL AND TERRI (INT. MARS ONE HAB.)

               They are stunned. Can hardly believe their eyes.

                                     PHIL
                         Jesus...

                         What is that...?

                                     LUKE
                         I don't know. But whatever it is, 
                         somebody built it. And not us.

               A few moments of silence while they try to absorb this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What about the sound? That signal 
                         you heard before the explosion?

                                     LUKE
                         Good, Jim, good. That's the key.

               A click of the mouse and they all HEAR, over speakers, the 
               DEEP PULSING BASS TONE.

                                     LUKE
                         Hear the pauses? That's what made me 
                         realize it's a pattern -- a repeating 
                         pattern.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Mathematical?

               Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very 
               quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this.

                                     LUKE
                         That's what I thought. There are 
                         distinct blocks in the pattern, and 
                         within each block the tones come in 
                         groups of three. Threethreethree. 
                         For months I struggled to analyze 
                         it, trying different constructs... 
                         Then I thought about dimensions.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         X-Y-Z coordinates...

                                     LUKE
                         Right! Three groups equals three 
                         dimensions... So I tried assigning 
                         different graphic values to each 
                         block, group and tone. And finally I 
                         got... this.

               He types another command. They all look at the monitor, the 
               glow reflecting on their faces. They are amazed again.

               Where we see the beautiful interlocking chain, the universally 
               familiar double helix, of a DNA molecule -- the elegant 
               blueprint of life.

                         is?

                         afraid I was just suffering from a 
                         form of asphyxia.

               She glances at him, surprised that he overheard her earlier 
               diagnosis. But he smiles, not offended.

                         thing here, somebody -- other than 
                         human. But what the hell is it?

                                     LUKE
                         My guess is, it's a signature. A 
                         self-portrait of whatever species 
                         created the Face.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         But that DNA looks human.

                                     TERRI
                         No way. It's missing the last pair 
                         of chromosomes. See?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah, but it's close. Damn close.

                                     TERRI
                         The difference between a man and an 
                         ape is less than three percent of 
                         genetic material. But that three 
                         percent gives you Mozart. Einstein.

                                     PHIL
                         Or Jack the Ripper.

               They look at him. Then all four turn, stare again at the 
               slowly rotating DNA, pondering its awesome mystery.

               MCCONNELL

               When he finally speaks, never takes his eyes off the screen. 
               We can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery 
               has on his imagination.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's been a long day. Let's get a 
                         couple hours sleep, then tackle this 
                         thing when we're fresher. Phil, your 
                         first priority will be to get the 
                         motherboards over to the ERV. 
                         Concentrate on getting communications 
                         up first.
                              (Phil nods)
                         Soon as we've got the juice, we'll 
                         send a packet to Micker, tell them 
                         Luke's OK, and that... everything 
                         else that's happened. The rest of us 
                         will take an inventory of supplies, 
                         see where we stand. Okay?

               The others nod in weary agreement. As they start out, towards 
               the relative warmth of the greenhouse, Terri looks at Luke, 
               at his scraggly beard and his long, lank hair. She smiles, 
               brushing some locks off his forehead.

                                     TERRI
                         C'mon. There's a pair of scissors in 
                         my medkit.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. ANOTHER SECTION. NEXT MORNING

               As in the Science Area, this space has enough thin oxygen 
               for the astronauts to remain unhelmeted. McConnell and Luke 
               are still going through what few supplies were salvaged from 
               the REMO.

               Luke pauses, rubbing the unfamiliar smoothness of his cheek. 
               His beard is gone, his hair neatly trimmed. McConnell enjoys 
               Luke's own wonder at his transformation.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How do you feel?

                                     LUKE
                         Like I just got back my other three 
                         percent.

               McConnell smiles. Terri enters through the hatch, removing 
               her helmet.

                                     TERRI
                         The backup generator is salvageable, 
                         and two of the solar panels. I'm 
                         pretty sure I can get the oxygen 
                         still back into production, too. So 
                         we're not in such bad shape, 
                         considering.

                                     LUKE
                         Good work, Terri.

               McConnell, rummaging through Phil's backpack, drops an already-
               opened bag of M&Ms. The CANDIES scatter and bounce all over 
               the floor.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Look at that. Phil's idea of absolute 
                         essentials.

               Luke and Terri smile. McConnell scoops up the fallen M&Ms. 
               He slows down as he does it, looking at the scatter of little 
               round CANDIES. Something tugging at the back of his mind...

               Phil's intricately designed M&M model of his "ideal woman", 
               floating weightlessly, as McConnell drifts past it, plucking 
               away a couple pieces of the candy. Phil reacting, in good-
               natured annoyance. The gap in the design left by McConnell's 
               theft...

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. ANOTHER SECTION. DAY

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL

               As he trembles with excitement. With sudden comprehension.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's not a signature.

                                     LUKE
                              (puzzled)
                         What?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That noise from the Face... It's not 
                         a signature. It's a test.

               Luke and Terri stare at him.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. MOMENTS LATER

               McConnell sits in front of the computer back in the science 
               lab area, staring once again at the mysterious DNA model. 
               Luke and Terri stand behind him. McConnell's energy, his new 
               certainty, is almost electrifying.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's asking us for the right answer. 
                         It wants us to put in the missing 
                         pair of chromosomes.

                                     LUKE

                         To prove that we're human.

               Terri and Luke look at each other, starting to understand.

                                     LUKE
                         We fired radar into that thing. 
                         Concentrated sound waves...

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Which it interpreted as a wrong 
                         answer... Yes! It's like a, a security 
                         alarm. When it gets an incorrect 
                         response, it defends itself.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil is listening in on radio. He's got panels open, wires 
               dangling, as he works his ongoing repair. He keys his mike, 
               uneasily.

                                     PHIL

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               As McConnell looks at Luke and Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (hesitates)
                         I don't know. But we've got to find 
                         out.
                              (to Luke, pointing)
                         Can you work this the other way? 
                         Figure out which tones would be 
                         equivalent to the missing chromosomes? 
                         Then dub them into your recording of 
                         the signal?

                                     LUKE
                         I think so, yes.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What about the radar gun? Will it 
                         accept that input? Can we transmit a 
                         completed signal back to the Face?

               Luke stares at him, startled by what he's implying.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil is also growing increasingly nervous.

                                     PHIL
                         Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim. What if 
                         you're wrong? Whoever goes out 
                         there... I mean, what if you're wrong? 
                         Three people have already died over 
                         that thing.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               As Luke and Terri look tensely at McConnell.

                                     TERRI
                         Four.

               McConnell looks at her.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, if we leave here without 
                         getting some answers, they all died 
                         in vain.

               Terri shakes her head.

                                     TERRI
                         We just don't know enough about that -- 
                         that thing out there to take any 
                         more chances.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What are we here for, if not to take 
                         chances...?

               His passion startles them; they've never seen him so 
               emotional. He points at the computer screen.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         This means we're not alone. It means 
                         we're on the brink of the greatest 
                         discovery in mankind's history. But 
                         we've still got to prove it. Who 
                         knows when someone else will get 
                         back here? Or if they ever will? You 
                         know what Congress is like. They'll 
                         say it's too dangerous, too much 
                         loss of life, let's go back to 
                         unmanned flights. We could be the 
                         last explorers to come here for 
                         decades. We're it, guys.
                              (pause)
                         We're it.

                                     LUKE
                              (quietly)
                         We don't have to go out there. There's 
                         a better way.

               They look at him, surprised.

               The familiar, plucky little figure of ARES-8 wheels across 
               ocher sand, with the radar gun jury-rigged onto its back. 
               Ares' video snout WHIRRS out, extending. The familiar bass 
               rumble of the Face is very loud from here.

               McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he 
               pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks, 
               then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the

               They see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot 
               from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE...

               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at the ominous sight. They're all more nervous than 
               they want to show. Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick 
               as he maneuvers the remote surveyor.

                         by that boulder.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY

               Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially 
               shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun 
               swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY

               Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid 
               of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively 
               down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods.

               Luke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of 
               awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who 
               finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY

               From the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched 
               electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as 
               it's fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops.

               For a moment nothing happens.

               Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining 
               sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains.

               ANGLE ON THE FACE

               As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins 
               to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding 
               out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement 
               is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises, 
               it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face. 
               No inside details can be seen.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon,

                         Check for radiation.

               Luke punches buttons, waits anxiously for a readout.

                                     LUKE
                         Normal. Seismic... normal. Anemometer 
                         steady. No sign of the vortex.

                                     PHIL
                         I don't know what we did, but guys -- 
                         does that look to you like a hostile 
                         gesture?

                                     TERRI
                         No. More like an invitation.

                                     LUKE
                         Or another test...

               McConnell is staring at the mysterious opening. On his face, 
               a growing look of determination.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, the four-man rover. Does it 
                         still work?

               The others look at him, their expressions changing as they 
               realize what he's implying.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. LATE DAY

               McConnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the Hab airlock. 
               Luke, Terri and Phil are coming out behind him. The wind has 
               picked up, and fine dust is blowing. They stop, staring off 
               in astonishment towards

               A FRIGHTENING SIGHT

               The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into 
               purplish-black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above. 
               The DUST STORM has turned their way; it's now sixty kilometers 
               away and closing. The main body of it reaches two thousand 
               meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand-
               kilometer front.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. McConnell turns to 
               Luke, whose expression is grim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How long before it hits?

                                     LUKE
                         An hour? Maybe less.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How bad?

                                     LUKE
                         A storm like that? It could go 
                         planetary. And last a year.

               McConnell stares at him.

                                     LUKE
                         It'll sock us in, Jim. We won't be 
                         able to take off. If that happens, 
                         with what few supplies we've got 
                         left...? We'll starve to death.

               McConnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm. The 
               others look at him with questioning gazes. He turns again. 
               There's the four-man rover, ready to go. Waiting.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil, how much longer to prep the 
                         ERV?

                                     PHIL
                         Maybe forty-five minutes. It'll be 
                         tight, but we can make it.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Then there's still time for us to 
                         get out there and back.

               He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the other. 
               Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Stay here. Continue the repair. If 
                         something goes wrong, you get out of 
                         here before that storm hits.

                                     PHIL
                         Go back... alone?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         If we're not back in forty-five 
                         minutes, I want you to prep and 
                         launch.
                              (looks at his armpad 
                              display)
                         That's 1950 hours.

                                     PHIL
                         Jim --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's not a suggestion, it's an order. 
                         You understand?

                                     PHIL
                              (reluctantly)
                         I understand. But --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You understand what?

                                     PHIL
                         If you're not back by 1950, I prep 
                         and launch.

               McConnell nods, satisfied. Looks at Terri and Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Let's go.

               They start towards the four-man rover. Dust is swirling more 
               thickly through the air, and the WIND IS LOUDER NOW. Phil 
               stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DUSK

               In a WIDE SHOT, we see the rover approaching the Face, across 
               the plains. The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the 
               storm approaches from that direction. It's marching 
               relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning 
               now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes 
               spinning off near its purple-black base...

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil has panels off. He's reaching into the guts of the main 
               computer, working feverishly. His repair kit is beside him.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. DUSK

               In a HIGH SHOT, we look down across the side of the Face and 
               its vast, open doorway, out of which the bright white light 
               is streaming. Into this corridor of light, we see the rover 
               arrive, slewing to a stop, throwing sand from its wheels.

               GROUND LEVEL SHOT

               Looking at the cavernous vertical gap in the side of the 
               Face. The opening towers to a dizzying height above us; the 
               white light strains our eyes. The three astronauts ENTER 
               FRAME as we see them, from behind, staring up.

               ON THE ASTRONAUTS' AWED FACES

               As they are stunned by the immensity of the scene, the cosmic 
               mystery before them. Luke and Terri look at McConnell. Another 
               moment of critical decision. He keys his mike.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil, do you read me?

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil keys his own mike.

                                     PHIL
                         Yeah, Jim. Your signal's breaking up 
                         a little in the storm, but I read 
                         you.

               EXT. THE FACE. DUSK

               McConnell stares into the bright opening. Bathed in its light.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're at the Face. We're gonna need 
                         a few minutes here. Same deadline, 
                         launch at 1950. With or without us. 
                         Do you copy?

                                     PHIL
                              (pause)
                         Copy that.

               Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim, are you sure you want to do 
                         this?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm not sure of anything anymore. 
                         But I didn't come a hundred million 
                         miles just to turn back in the last 
                         ten feet.

               Luke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal. 
               McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of 
               them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective breath. 
               Then they walk forward together, into the light.

               INT. THE FACE. DUSK

               The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a 
               free hand.

               The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances, 
               textures, colors -- anything at all. They can't see walls, 
               ceiling, even a floor.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Surface seems firm and level.

                                     LUKE
                         Roger that. Texture is smooth.

                                     TERRI
                         I've got good footing and no 
                         obstructions. Let's check our --

               Behind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant airlock 
               sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go of 
               each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they 
               came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some 
               sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them.

                                     TERRI
                         It's solid again! We're trapped.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Don't move! Keep this orientation.

               The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the 
               brightness, some twenty feet apart.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (keys his mike)
                         Phil? Phil, can you still hear me?

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the 
               main computer. It works! He's immensely relieved.

                                     PHIL
                         Computers are online! Ready to load 
                         software. But guys -- we're losing 
                         visibility here.

               He glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust. Then 
               realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio.

                                     PHIL
                         Guys...? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone 
                         there...?

               No answer. Phil stares at his radio in dread.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't leave me.

               INT. FACE. DUSK

               McConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. He can see 
               that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the 
               shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse. He 
               hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his 
               right glove.

               Terri and Luke see this.

                                     TERRI
                              (alarmed)
                         Jim, what're you doing? You'll 
                         depressurize!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I don't think so.

               McConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the 
               hiss of rushing air.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim, seal it!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         No. That was air going into my suit, 
                         not out. Look at your own suits -- 
                         they're not rigid anymore. We've got 
                         pressure in here.

               Luke looks at his sleeve. McConnell's right.

                                     TERRI
                         Above Mars atmospheric? That's 
                         impossible.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're millions of miles from Earth 
                         and we're inside a gigantic white 
                         face. What's impossible?

               Terri types on her arm keypad. She's amazed.

                                     TERRI
                         There's six psi in here...
                              (taps more keys)
                         Nitrogen and oxygen.

                                     LUKE
                         Otherwise known as air?

               Terri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring. 
               Luke follows suit.

                                     TERRI
                         Hey, there may be some lethal trace 
                         gasses I haven't picked up yet, or... 
                         or... oh, the hell with it.

               Terri starts taking off her helmet. In a few moments, all 
               three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against 
               their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air. 
               And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed 
               another kind of test...

               HIGH, STRIATED WALL

               Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled 
               eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, 
               plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height 
               and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the 
               hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach 
               ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from 
               within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts.

               THE ASTRONAUTS BLINK

               Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end 
               of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame

               A SHAPE MATERIALIZES

               And slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form, 
               which we somehow sense is female. She appears benign, 
               wondrous. This glowing MARTIAN -- a holograph -- regards the 
               astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to 
               say "Enter." All her motions are both calm and calming -- 
               precise, unhurried, gracious.

               MCCONNELL, LUKE AND TERRI

               Look at each other. They're awed into silence, and still 
               tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than 
               fear. Their eyes agree: Let's go.

               They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the 
               ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian, 
               who retreats before them. They go through the hatch and 
               disappear inside.

               INT. MARTIAN STRUCTURE. DUSK

               Following the Martian, they find themselves in a round, open 
               space, defined by light, with a smooth matte-metallic floor, 
               but without apparent walls.

               The Martian stops, turns, facing them. The astronauts stop, 
               too, uncertain what they're meant to do. Then the Martian 
               gestures again.

               A cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the 
               floor in front of the astronauts. Inside it, a swirl of eerie 
               lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this 
               column, forming a loose triangle. As they stare into it, the 
               myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their 
               spacesuits.

               IN THE HOLOGRAPHIC COLUMN

               The whirling lights resolve into images, which relate to 
               them the story of ancient Mars:

               A BLUE PLANET

               we do not recognize. All is peaceful, beautiful.

               INTERCUT

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah. It's Mars.

               SUDDENLY A HUGE ASTEROID

               Tumbles through space towards the planet...

                                     TERRI
                         Oh my God.

               ON THE PLANET - CLOSER VIEW

               As thousands of small rocketships lift away from the surface, 
               heading in a stream out of the solar system...

               THE ASTEROID IMPACTS

               And a wall of fire and debris scours the planet. Oceans boil 
               and vaporize. Two gigantic hunks are blasted out of the 
               planet, spinning in flames...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Involuntarily flinch, bathed in the fiery images...

               THE PLANET IS NOW DEAD

               As dust storms roil across its cold, lifeless surface. The 
               flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at this devastation, deeply moved.

               IN DEEP SPACE

               The stream of Martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it 
               continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system. 
               Then we zero in on

               ONE PARTICULAR ROCKETSHIP

               As it peels off and goes in another direction. Graphics show 
               a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix 
               of DNA. The ship heads towards another blue planet in our 
               solar system...

               EARTH

               As it was then. More clouds than now, more ocean, and the 
               landforms all wedged together.

               TERRI

               Her voice is soft.

                                     TERRI
                         Earth, when it was still Pangaea. 
                         Before the continents separated.

               THE LONE MARTIAN SHIP

               Makes a fiery streak through Earth's atmosphere and plunges 
               into the ocean.

               Instantly the image of the DNA double helix grows, filling 
               the entire holographic column, then it begins to spin and 
               pulse, disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new 
               images...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Cry out, stunned by the strobelike power of the display as

               LIVING FORMS

               Flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing, 
               crawling, leaping, flying: one-celled microscopic organisms, 
               plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs, 
               birds, small mammals, larger mammals -- the entire stunning 
               panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive 
               sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck

               FACES OF THE ASTRONAUTS

               Until finally the images whirl away, the holographic column 
               dissolves, leaving only a circle of glowing, concentric, 
               colored rings on the floor. The astronauts are left staring 
               at each other across the open space where the column had 
               been.

               THE MARTIAN

               Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their 
               circle, taking the fourth position. McConnell is opposite 
               her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side. The 
               Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands. 
               As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into 
               McConnell's eyes.

               MCCONNELL

               Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It's 
               the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness 
               or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         They're us. We're them...

                                     LUKE
                         We're Martians...?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's what she means.

                                     TERRI
                         Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion.

               McConnell and Luke look at her.

                                     TERRI
                         Almost six hundred million years 
                         ago, there was a sudden expansion of 
                         life on Earth. The first multi-celled 
                         plants and animals appeared. No one 
                         has ever understood why...

                                     LUKE
                         They seeded Earth.

               We hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and 
               simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor 
               begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the 
               circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the 
               outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally 
               reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo 
               blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter 
               here, like stars against a midnight sky.

               THE MARTIAN

               Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in 
               particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle 
               of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first 
               time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as 
               abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes.

               Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden, 
               static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor.

                                     PHIL
                              (over radio)
                         ...in, please. Can you... me?

               Terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike.

                                     TERRI
                         Phil, we're here! We read you.

               Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the 
               relief in Phil's voice. And then the desperation.

                                     PHIL
                         Thank God! Listen, this storm is 
                         really --
                              (loud static)
                         -- few more minutes, I can't --
                              (more static)
                         You've gotta get back to the ship!

               And then they hear only STATIC. His signal is lost.

                                     TERRI
                         Phil? Phil...?

               Suddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register, 
               with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of 
               the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as

               THE FIRST ORANGE BAND

               Begins to glow brighter. McConnell turns, looking at this 
               new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We are in a ship. This is a ship. 
                         And the countdown has already started.

               Terri looks at Luke, alarmed.

                                     LUKE
                         He's right.

                                     TERRI
                         Then let's get the hell out of here!

               She scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him. As he catches 
               it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they 
               came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware 
               that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's still 
               rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of 
               the colored rings.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim...

               McConnell doesn't turn.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim, we gotta go.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm not coming with you.

                                     TERRI
                              (stunned)
                         What?

               Coming back, she sees how calm he is. How certain.

                                     TERRI
                         What are you talking about? We've 
                         got to get home.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's where I'm going. Don't you 
                         see? That's what all this is for.
                              (McConnell gestures 
                              at the ship around 
                              them)
                         You were right Terri. This is an 
                         invitation. To follow them. To follow 
                         them home.

               He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this 
               idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half 
               smile.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I have to go. This is the mission 
                         now. To find out who we are. Isn't 
                         that why we came here? Like Maggie 
                         said, "To stand on a new world and 
                         look beyond it to the next one."

               Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remembers 
               too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them 
               both.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You know, when you think about it -- 
                         I wasn't even supposed to be here -- 
                         all the accidents, everything that 
                         got us to this point, it's just... 
                         it's just... I just know it's right.

               Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm okay. I know what I'm doing. But 
                         you're running out of time. You've 
                         gotta get back to the ERV and get 
                         off this planet. Now please go.

               Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend.

                                     LUKE
                         I once felt like I was taking your 
                         turn. But now I think maybe you're 
                         taking mine. Guess I'm a little 
                         jealous.

               They clasp hands for a moment. But in this moment is a 
               lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell.

                                     LUKE
                         Thanks for saving my life.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         My pleasure.

               Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his helmet, 
               as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken 
               beat. Her eyes are glistening.

                                     TERRI
                         I wish Woody were here to see this. 
                         He would've wanted to go too, Jim.

               Terri smiles. She is starting on the road to recovery. She's 
               going to be okay.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He's here, Terri. We wouldn't have 
                         made it without him.

               Terri nods. She digs into one of her suit's pockets, pulls 
               something out. She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes 
               around it.

                                     TERRI
                         Take care, Jim.

               McConnell smiles. Terri smiles back at him. Then she turns, 
               picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused, 
               looking back.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, Jim...?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah?

                         Always do.

               Luke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him, 
               then hurry away, into the darkness.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks down at what Terri gave him.

               IT'S WOODY'S NECK CHAIN

               With the little Flash Gordon rocketship.

               MCCONNELL

               Grips this tightly as he looks up.

               The hanger-like hatch has reopened, and Luke and Terri, 
               helmeted again, emerge from the Face. The leading edge of 
               the dust storm is upon them. They can't see much more than a 
               few meters.

               As they reach the rover, they hear, even in this chaos, that 
               the deep pulsing tone of the Face has started again. They 
               look at each other, uncertain what this means. But McConnell 
               is now beyond their help. Luke keys his mike.

                         I can barely read you. Let's get the

                         Is anyone there? Can anyone read me?

               Phil gets no response. He is shaking, almost crying. He 
               hesitates, then starts hitting some keys.

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell has shed his backpack, with its unneeded oxygen 
               tank. He steps cautiously onto the colored rings. Nothing 
               seems to happen. Moving further, he takes his place on the 
               indigo circle at their core. He looks at

               THE GLOWING TAKE-OFF COUNTDOWN INDICATOR

               As it dips from orange into red; the BELL TONES are continuous 
               now, very deep and rapid.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

               The rover, with Luke and Terri inside, races away towards 
               the safety of the ERV, as the maelstrom boils over the Face 
               behind them. The sky is purplish black, thick with flying 
               debris and eerie lightning flashes. Towering billows of dust 
               chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they 
               speed towards us, passing OUT OF FRAME.

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell reacts, surprised, as suddenly

               A TRANSPARENT, GLASS-LIKE CYLINDER

               Begins to rise around him, swiftly and smoothly, coming up 
               from the circumference of the indigo circle.

               Then a second, identical cylinder -- the top half -- drops 
               down from somewhere overhead. The two sections meet and fuse 
               in a flash of light, containing McConnell inside them, as 
               neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube.

               MCCONNELL

               Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being 
               imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he's virtually 
               immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't 
               even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Phil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping 
               switches and pressing buttons. He looks at his

               DIGITAL CLOCK

               Which reads "1350."

               PHIL IS STRICKEN, TORMENTED

               His finger hovers over a "Fire" button. He licks his lips 
               nervously, squeezes his eyes shut, and hits the button.

               And the words: "IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED"

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds 
               him, when something catches his attention. He arches his 
               neck, looking down.

               A COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID

               Is beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some 
               unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are 
               covered.

               MCCONNELL'S EYES

               Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder 
               but

               HIS GLOVED HANDS

               Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks down again.

               THE COBALT LIQUID

               Is up to his knees. Now his thighs...

               MCCONNELL

               Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher, 
               can he somehow climb to safety?

               ABOVE HIM

               The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent. He 
               can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising 
               into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself. 
               These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water 
               snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a 
               collision course.

               INT. ROVER. NIGHT

               Luke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri 
               stares at a dashboard computer screen. They have to shout to 
               be heard over the ROARING WIND.

                                     TERRI
                         I've lost the Base Camp beacon!

                         It's our only chance.

                                     TERRI
                         Don't worry! I've worked with Phil 
                         for four years! I know Jim gave him 
                         a direct order, but he won't leave 
                         without us.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

               The Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing 
               it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover. It 
               disappears from view!

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Phil sits in the pilot's seat. He is looking at a computer 
               graphic that shows the engines readying to launch. With 
               resignation, he keys his mike.

                                     PHIL
                         This is ERV, do you read? ERV to 
                         Rover, do you read...?

               Phil waits a second, then reaches slowly for a blinking red 
               switch that reads "LAUNCH." He hesitates, then actually has 
               his fingers on it, about to flip it, when he hears a crackle 
               of static on the radio. Phil keys his mike.

                                     PHIL
                         This is ERV, do you read?

                         in.

               And Phil chokes back a sob. Blinking back the tears, he tries 
               to compose himself, then keys his mike.

                                     PHIL
                         Uh, Phil's not here right now. He 
                         left for Earth five minutes ago.

               EXT. THE FACE. NIGHT

               FROM GROUND LEVEL we see that the coils of energy are rising 
               from the forehead of the Face, from its "third eye," spinning 
               and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex. 
               But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew, 
               this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks 
               begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin, 
               cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing 
               uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face 
               itself and spiral into the atmosphere. The peak of the forming 
               vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds, 
               causing a dark counter-swirl.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT

               Phil stands at the bottom of the ERV's ladder, gripping it 
               to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust.

               THE ROVER appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm 
               seeming to chase it from behind. Luke and Terri climb out, 
               struggle towards him through the wind. Phil grips their hands, 
               helping them over to the ladder. He looks back, confused.

                                     PHIL

               Phil stares at her, bewildered.

               LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER, we see that the cobalt-blue 
               fluid has risen to McConnell's upper chest. Now it's at his 
               shoulders! It pours into his suit through his neck ring.

               He strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep 
               his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid.

               He sucks in deep desperate gulps of air, his head thrashing 
               from side to side. Then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth, 
               his nose, his forehead. His whole body is submerged!

               The level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top 
               of the cylinder.

               MCCONNELL

               Squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath. Not so much 
               fighting this anymore as simply floating in place, waiting 
               for his inevitable death...

               side, pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the 
               Face. As the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical 
               shape, we see through its center to a rising form -- the 
               Martian ship. It is a flattened convex circle whose matte-
               metallic angles replicate the "Face" imagery.

               The vortex is now a tight, rapidly spinning cylinder. As it

               Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the 
               huge buildup of G-forces tears at his body. We're reminded 
               of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the 
               same thing about to happen to McConnell?

               His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his 
               lips. His last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken 
               from his lungs.

               a SERIES of rapid-fire, almost subliminal IMAGES FROM THE 
               PAST. We recognize each one. Previously, though, we saw them 
               as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view 
               them from new and slightly different angles. These images 
               INTERCUT with glimpses of McConnell's pale, shaking, near-

               Time itself seems to stop.

               McConnell opens his eyes, staring STRAIGHT AT US. And then, 
               fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his 
               mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe 
               it.

               His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe 
               it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes, 
               the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully 
               trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his 
               eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...

               specific point in the stars. Then the Martian ship -- a 
               rounded darker form, little more than a blip within the vast, 
               blue-white column of energy -- shoots away from the surface,

               vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planet's 
               surface, which it now completely covers.

               As the Martian ship flashes by us, it passes another ship, 
               much smaller and slower, rising through the storm clouds on 
               a different trajectory. We recognize the familiar, comfortable

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Luke, Terri and Phil are strapped in, with their acceleration 
               just starting to level off, when suddenly their cockpit 
               interior is starkly bathed in white light. They wince at the 
               unearthly radiance, shielding their faceplates with gloved 
               hands.

                                     TERRI
                         Dear God. Look at that.

               Through their cockpit window, they watch the Martian ship 
               hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed.

                                     PHIL
                         Is that him?

               Luke nods. Their eyes are glistening. Luke's voice is a 
               whisper, both of prayer and farewell.

                                     LUKE
                         Godspeed Jim McConnell.

               EXT. SPACE

               Looking through the cockpit window we see the Martian ship 
               receding into the infinite distance of space -- a long blue-
               white scratch that in moments begins to fade. Finally it is 
               a tiny point of light, taking its place amongst the limitless 
               expanse of the star-filled heavens.

          1 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 1

           Static shots: A deserted locker room. Empty showers.
           Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in
           a coal mine. THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV.
           LEGEND: October 15, 2001

                         
           We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the
           faint voice of an announcer -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           ... nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who
           has just three at bats in the series, and
           none of them hits - as he settles back in

                          -

          2 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM -NIGHT 2


                         
           At the end of a tunnel, the A's empty dugout. The empty
           diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on.

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has
           it, the pitch, Saenz swings and -

                         
           The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut
           off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that
           wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in
           fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure
           seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:

           STEVE LYONS V/O
           - a ground out to second, Thom, is not
           what the A's were looking for from Saenz -
           down by two in the ninth -

                         
           The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of
           peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty
           diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the
           baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the
           radio back on -

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout
           to bat for Menechino -

           2.

           2.

                         

                         
           He turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits.
           Switches the radio back on -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           - the A's are down to their last strike
           and this Yankee crowd is on its feet -
           Rivera squints for the sign, he has it,
           delivers and -
           Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits
           just a few moments. Turns the radio back on -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees -
           down two games to none - have come back
           to win three, and the Division Series.

                         
           The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on
           Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and
           climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly
           hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward
           an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -

                         

           STEVE LYONS V/O
           This is an exceptional feat not only for
           New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though
           not the kind you can be proud of: Only
           once before has a team lost a Division
           Series after winning the first two games -

          3 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 3


                         
           It's coming from a small television a night security
           guard is watching. But when he sees Billy approaching,
           he quickly shuts it off.

                          BILLY
           It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.
           It's no big deal.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           No, it's okay, I don't need to watch it.

                         
           The guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently
           turns in his hands -

                         

                          BILLY
           How's Meg?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           She's good, thanks.

                         
           - and the glass window of the bar behind him -

           3.

           3.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           And the boys?

                         

                          SECURITY GUARD
           They're good. Everybody's good.

                          BILLY
           That's good.
           The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through
           the glass, but it doesn't happen.

                         

                          BILLY
           Night.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Night, Billy. It was a great season.

          4 EXT. COLISEUM - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 4

           A lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the
           Coliseum. We HEAR-

           TARA V/O
           They had three times your payroll, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah...

           TARA V/O
           You're not watching them celebrate,
           right?
           Car's off. Billy sits in the dark on his phone.

                         

                          BILLY
           No. That would be, uh--

                         

           TARA V/O
           Pointless? Self-destructive? Masochistic?

                          BILLY
           Are you asking me to pick one?

           TARA V/O
           What you should be doing is thinking
           about what an amazing job you did and how
           great you are.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not
           thinking about either of those things.

           4.

           4.

                         

                         

           TARA V/O
           You take a team with that payroll to the
           playoffs? You take the Yankees to a fifth
           game? I'm not even sure the better team
           won.

                          BILLY
           They were down two-love and then beat us
           three in a row. Trust me, the better team
           won.

                         
          BILLY presses a button on his portable radio and is hit
          with sound of sports talk radio--

                         

           CALLER V/O
           --while embarrassing the entire city and
           making a mockery of their fans. I'm sick
           of this.

           TARA V/O
           Let's go away.

                         

                          BILLY
           That sounds good.

                         

          CUT TO WHAT BILLY'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE TIME -
          Three enormous looming likenesses of the Oakland A's
          premiere players on floodlit banners--Jason Giambi,
          Johnny Damon, Jason Isringhausen.

           TARA V/O
           Someplace they don't have a baseball
           team.

                          BILLY
           How about Oakland?

                         

           TARA V/O
           Okay, here are the rules for tonight. You
           can do anything you want but you can't
           give any quotes to the press, go on the
           internet or hurt my car, we have a deal?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

           TARA V/O
           They had three times your payroll, Billy.
          From the radio we've been hearing shards of "--an
          unprecedented choke--", "--get rid of Billy Beane--", "--
          Billy Beane knows nothing about baseball--".

           5.

           5.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

           TARA V/O
           How about Hawaii? I'll make a
           reservation someplace. The place with
           the turtles.

                         
           Billy gets out of the car.

                         

                          BILLY
           Great. I'm on my way.

                         
           Billy chucks the radio away. Gets back in the car, puts
           it in gear. HARD CUT TO --

          5 INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 5


                         
           Blur of shapes and colors as we move through a crush of
           travelers to a Hawaiian Airlines counter where Billy and
           Tara check luggage. Billy's got a cell phone to his ear.

                          BILLY
           Is it Boston? You're talking to Boston?
           What are they offering?

           BORAS (ON PHONE)
           What does it matter to you?

                         

                          BILLY
           What?!

                         

           BORAS V/O
           I mean -- what does it matter since
           whatever it is you can't afford it.

                          BILLY
           You don't know that.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           I don't?

                         

                          TICKET CLERK
           You need to hurry.

                          BILLY
           I don't know that -- since I don't know
           what they're offering.

                          (TO TARA)
           What did she say?

                         

                          TARA
           She said we had to hurry up.

           6.

           6.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Scott? Scott?

                         
          The call's been disconnected. CUT TO: Another corridor,
          as Billy and Tara head toward security. Billy on the
          phone with Boras, continuing where they left off --

                         

                          BILLY
           What did they offer?

                         

           BORAS V/O
           They offered seven and a quarter.

                         

                          BILLY
           Just to be clear -- they offered seven
           and a quarter.

           BORAS V/O
           Yes.

                         

                          BILLY
           As opposed to you said seven and a
           quarter and they're thinking about it.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           No, they offered seven and a quarter and
           I'm thinking about it.
           (nothing from Billy)
           And you're thinking -- what.

                          BILLY
           I'm thinking I don't want to lose Damon,
           but I don't pay my whole infield seven
           million dollars.

                          TARA
           We're losing Damon?

                         

           BORAS V/O
           For seven and a half, Billy, you can keep
           Johnny Damon and we can be done thinking.
           I have to go, my plane is boarding.

                         

                          BILLY
           Wait, don't hang up. Don't hang up --

                         
          Billy drops the phone in a plastic container, steps
          through the metal detector like it's a stick-up, grabs
          the phone again.

                         

                          TSA OFFICER 1
           Is that phone still on?

                         

                          BILLY
           What's the difference?

           7.

           7.

                         

                         

                          TSA OFFICER 1
           Faradie. Can his phone be on?

                         

                          TSA OFFICER 2
           Sir, you need to turn your phone off.

                          BILLY
           It's already through.
          Billy grabs his phone from the other side.

                         

                          BILLY
           Seven point five?

                         

           BORAS V/O

           Arn. Billy. We gotta talk about Giambi.

           Wait, we're losing Giambi, too?

                         

           ARN V/O
           I can't talk about that now. I can't
           talk about anything now.

           Who are you talking to -- the Yankees?

                         

           ARN V/O
           I'm talking to everybody. But not today.
           I'm not in today. I'm hanging up.

           Don't hang up.

           The ceremony is in progress as Billy arrives, plucks a
           yarmulke from a basket, sets it on his head and finds a
           place in the back row for himself and his carry-on.
           He listens to the boy's monotone-reading of verses. He
           fidgets. Taps his foot. Checks his watch. Turns to the
           person down the row and whispers --

           As attendees exit the ceremony and enter the adjacent

          Arn walks away. Billy looks to his right to see a 12 year

           Billy tries, but is having trouble sitting still as he
           talks with Steve Schott - the A's owner - around 60 - a
           college player way back when. He's a successful home
           builder now. Models of developments lie around.

                          BILLY
           We're losing Damon and Giambi. We can't
           survive losing Damon and Giambi.

           I can win without a closer. I can't
           without power.

           I have. They want more.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           So offer them a little more.

                          BILLY
           I have. They want more than a little
           more.

                          SCHOTT
           Like what. What'll it cost - say - to
           keep Giambi?

           For one year?
           Billy nods. Steve smiles. And Billy knows what it
           means. It means, That makes it easy - there's nothing
           more to discuss on the matter.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           I have confidence you'll find a way to
           make it work without them.

                          BILLY
           I can't.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           Sure you can.

           Billy. What are we? The Taj Mahal?
           We're a small-market team. Obviously, we
           can't afford Giambi at such a (price) -

                          BILLY
           Fine. He's gone. But I might - for a
           bit more than last year - be able to keep
           Damon in (Oakland) -
           (Steve is shaking his

                          HEAD NO)
           I need more money, Steve.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           Billy...

                          BILLY
           I can't compete against a hundred and
           twenty million dollar payroll with a
           forty million dollar payroll.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           We just won 102 games with a forty
           million dollar payroll.

                          BILLY
           With Giambi and Damon. We wouldn't have
           without them.
          Silence. Then -

                          BILLY
           You can't ask me to be okay with losing.
           That's too much to ask a professional
           athlete.

                         

                          SCHOTT

                          BILLY--

                          BILLY
           It's too much, Steve!

                         

                          SCHOTT
           You're not a professional athlete!

                          (BEAT)
           You're a professional GM.

           We're a small market team. You're a small
           market GM. And I'm asking you to be okay
           with not spending money I don't have. And
           I'm asking you to take a breath and shake
           off the loss. And then I'm asking you to
           get back in a room with your people and
           figure out how you're going to replace
           these guys with the money I do have.

                          (BEAT)
           Got it?
           SCHOTT can go from milquetoast to ruthless in a blink and
           he just did.

          10 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - MOVING - LATER - DAY 10


                         
           Billy's on his cell again as he crosses the Bay Bridge.

                         

                          BILLY
           Scott. Billy.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           What was that beep?

                          BILLY
           It's just my phone, it's about to
           die, but this'll be quick - listen -
           I'm losing my favorite prospects,
           but I got you the seven point five.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           That's great. I'll get right back to

                          (YOU) -

                          BILLY
           No. No, you won't. I got it for you and
           we're done. Damon stays in Oakland.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           Billy - I have to talk to Johnny -
           obviously. It's my fiduciary (duty) -

                          BILLY
           Whose number is that - seven point five.
           Mine?

           BORAS V/O
           No, it's mine -

                         

                          BILLY
           It's yours. So make your call, but don't
           play me, Scott. We have a deal. I won't
           be a stalking horse. The word stays in
           the - dictionary.

          11 INT. BILLY'S HOUSE - DANVILLE - LATER - DAY 11


                         
           The door pushes open and Billy comes in after his very
           long day. He sets his carry-on bag down. Takes out his
           dead cell phone and plugs it into a charger. Calls Tara
           on the land line.

                          BILLY
           Sorry, hon. I'm gonna need another day.

           TARA (V.O.)
           Take your time, do your thing. There are
           a lot of cute guys here.

                         

                          BILLY
           You've got my suitcase?

           TARA (V.O.)
           No, the airline sent it to Prague.

                          BILLY

                          (PAUSE)
           Why?

                         

           TARA (V.O.)
           Well, we left out of Oakland, honey...
           and I think the baggage handlers knew it
           was yours.

                          BILLY
           (beat, can this get
           any worse?)
           Okay.

                         
           Billy's cell phone rings --

                         

                          BILLY
           I gotta take this.

                         

           TARA (V.O.)
           Wish you weren't insane. Miss you.
           She hangs up. Billy hangs up and switches to his cell --

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

           BORAS (V.O.)
           Billy. Scott. I just got off the phone
           with Dan.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, you didn't.

           17.

           17.

                         

                         

           BORAS (V.O.)
           Yeah, I was surprised he even called me.
           Because he had said --

                         

                          BILLY
           No, I have Johnny for seven-point-five or
           he's not playing anywhere, because that's
           the deal --

           BORAS (V.O.)
           Boston just upped it to seven-seven-five.

                         
           Billy's hand is already in motion to smash the phone,
           but in a herculean feat of self disciple, he manages to
           restrain himself before impact.

           BORAS (V.O.)
           You there?

                         

                          BILLY
           We had a deal.

                         

           BORAS (V.O.)
           We have a deal. If it's eight million.

                          BILLY
           Why am I the ugliest girl at the dance,
           Scott? Why do I get the feeling I'm
           always gonna be a quarter million short?

                         

           BORAS (V.O.)
           I'm just doing my job for my client.
           That's all I'm doing.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, you played me. And you're playing me
           now. Congratulations, asshole. You win.
           Billy hangs up on him.

                         

                          CUT TO:

          15 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - SCOUTING ROOM - PRESENT DAY 15


                         
           Billy and his scouting department - ten men older than
           him - all former players and tobacco chewers still, each
           with his own can of Copenhagen and wastebasket - sitting
           around a large underground cinder block "war room" whose
           most extravagant appointment is a Mr. Coffee.

                         
           Two large white-boards dominate a wall, covered with
           magnetic strips with players' names on them.

           18.

           18.

                         

                         
          On the left board - every player in the A's organization.
          On the other, even larger board - every player that may
          be of interest to them from the other organizations.

                         
          It's the most complex chess board you will ever see.
          But what can be easily discerned are the obvious holes in
          the A's team - the star players they are about to lose -
          their names set apart from the positions they're
          vacating: Jason Giambi (1B), Johnny Damon (CF), Jason
          Isringhausen (RP).

                         

                          GRADY
           Alright, guys... we had a great year. We
           won 102 games and we only came a buck
           short in New York. Now the bad news...
           we've got three big holes to fill.

                          (THEN)
           Let's start with who we like for Giambi.
           We'll go around the room. Who you like,
           Matty?

                          KEOUGH
           I like Geronimo.
           (approval from the

                          OTHER SCOUTS)
           Guy's an athlete. This guy is big, fast
           and talented.

                         

                          GEORGE
           Six foot four.

                         

                          PITTARO
           Top of my list.

                         

                          POTE
           Clean cut, good face.

                          ARTIE
           Good jaw. He's the real deal.

                         

                          GEORGE
           Five tools, good lookin'.

                         

                          BILLY
           Can he hit?

                          KEOUGH
           He's a tools guy.

                         

                          BILLY
           Can he hit?

                          KEOUGH
           He's got a great swing. Natural swing.

           19.

           19.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           So you're saying he can't hit.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           He can hit.

                         

                          BARRY
           The ball explodes off his bat.

                         

                          ARTIE
           It's exciting. When he hits it sounds
           like he's droppin' a firecracker at his
           feet.

                         

                          PITTARO
           Down in the pisser you can hear that
           sound.

                         

                          BARRY
           Sounds like Mays, Mantle, Aaron...

                         

                          BILLY
           That's not what I asked. I asked can he
           hit.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           He's a good hitter.

                         

                          BILLY
           If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit
           good?

                          KEOUGH
           He needs a little work. He'll be able to
           hit. He could be a great hitter.

                          BILLY
           Right... we put him up against big league
           competition and suddenly he'll be able to
           hit.

                         
          Grady moves on --

                          GRADY
           Artie, who do we like?

                         
          Billy backs off, incredulous as the scouts prattle on --

                          ARTIE
           I like Perez. He swings like a man.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           He swings like a man who swings at too
           much.

           20.

           20.

                         

                         

                          ARTIE
           There's some work needs to be done. I
           admit it. He needs to be reworked a
           little. But he's noticeable.

                          GRADY
           He's notable?

                         

                          ARTIE
           No, he's noticeable. You notice him.

                         

                          KEOGH
           He's got an ugly girlfriend.

                         

                          BARRY
           What's that mean?

                         

                          KEOGH
           Ugly girlfriend means no confidence.

                         

                          BARRY
           Alright. That's true.

                         

                          PITTARO
           I agree with Art. I like the way he
           walks into a room. Kid's so confident
           his dick gets there two minutes before he
           does.

                         

                          GEORGE
           Passes the eye candy test. He's got the
           looks, he's ready to play the part. He
           just needs some playing time.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           I'm just saying, his girlfriend's a 6.

                         

                          BARRY
           Billy, if you want to talk about another
           Giambi, this guy could be it.
          Enough. Billy raises a book above the table, drops it
          with a dull THUD... STOPPING TRAFFIC.

                         

                          GRADY
           Is that a suggestion, Billy?

                          BILLY
           Guys, stop. You're talking like this is
           business as usual. It's not.

                         

                          GRADY
           We're trying to solve the problem.

           21.

           21.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Not like this. You're not even looking
           at the problem.

                         

                          GRADY
           We not only have a very clear
           understanding of the problem we now face,
           but everyone in this room has faced
           similar problems countless times before.

                         

                          BILLY
           Good. What's the problem?

                         

                          GRADY
           The problem is that we've lost 3 key
           players that we now have to replace.

                         

                          BILLY
           Uh-uh. What's the problem?

                         

                          PITTARO
           The problem is the same as it always is;
           we've got to put a team together with
           what we've got.

                         

                          BILLY
           Uh-uh. What's the problem?

                         

                          BARRY
           We've got 38 home runs to replace, 120
           rbi's, 47 doubles...

                         

                          BILLY
           Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to
           solve is that this is an unfair game.
           There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet
           of crap and then there's us. And now
           we've been gutted. We're organ donors to
           the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys
           and the Yankees took our heart. And now
           I'm listening to the same old shit about
           having a good body and being a tools guy
           like you're looking for Fabio. Is there
           another first baseman like Giambi?

                          (BEAT)
           Is there?
          Everyone mumbles "no."

                          BILLY
           Then stop looking for one because what
           we'll surely wind up with is the
           McNuggets version of Giambi.

           22.

           22.

                         

                         

                          GRADY
          Look, we're gonna find 25 guys, put `em
          through player development, teach `em how
          to play Oakland A baseball. This is no
          time to push the panic button. This is
          the way we've been doing it for 150
          years. Let us do our job.

                         

                          BILLY
          If we try to play like the Yankees in
          here, we're not going to be able to play
          with them out there.

                         

                          GRADY
          That's fortune cookie wisdom.

                          BILLY
          No, it's just regular wisdom.

                          POTE
          Who's Fabio?

                         

                          GRADY
          Okay, Billy. Clearly you have something
          on your mind.

                          BILLY
          Bill James.

                         

                          ARTIE
          You're not serious?

                         

                          PITTARO
          We're not playing fantasy baseball,
          Billy.

                          BARRY
          Those aren't new ideas, they disproved
          that years ago.

                          GRADY
          Bill James was a night security guard at
          the Stokely Van Camp Pork and Beans
          Factory.

                         

                          BILLY
          He thinks differently than anyone in
          baseball.

                          GRADY
          He's not in baseball. He's in pork and
          beans.

           23.

           23.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Don't attack the man, attack the
           argument.

                         

                          PITTARO
           (to the room)
           I think he just won the argument.

                         
          Chuckles.

                         

                          BILLY
           What if we've been wrong this whole time
           about what ingredients manufacture a win?
           What if this whole time we thought it was
           the chicken that made the chicken soup
           taste good when really it was the onions
           that made the chicken soup taste good?
           Onions are a lot cheaper than chicken,
           you see what I'm saying?

                         

                          POTE
           I don't have the first idea what you're
           saying.

                         

                          BILLY
           We gotta start over. We gotta rethink
           this thing. We gotta look where others
           aren't looking.

                         

                          GRADY
           With all due respect, we've been doing
           this for a long time.

                         

                          BILLY
           That doesn't mean you're doing it right.
           Do you watch nature docs? You know what
           happens to the runt of the litter? He
           dies. I'm open to any solution, as long
           as it's not what the other guys are
           doing.

                          (THEN)
           Now, I'm going to Cleveland to poach an
           outfielder named Brandon Garcia --

                         

                          TBD SCOUT
           Hold on -- You're going to Cleveland for
           a double-A guy?

                         

                          GRADY
           Billy, I've seen Garcia. He's got a bad
           body. It's not a pretty sight.

                         

                          PITTARO

                          KEOGH
           That is a big boy.

                         

                          GRADY
           He's not just big, but kind of doughy. A
           fleshy kind of body.

                         

                          BILLY
           Oh, you mean like Babe Ruth.

                         

                          SCOUTS (UNISON)
           He's no Babe Ruth.

                         

                          PITTARO
           When he walks, Billy, his thighs stick
           together. There's enough friction there
           to start a bonfire.

                          KEOGH
           If you saw him, I'm telling you, you
           wouldn't want to go to Cleveland.

                          BARRY
           Billy, can I make a suggestion? If you
           could get Ricardo Rincon... he'd be worth
           the trip to Cleveland.

                         

                          GEORGE
           That would solve our left handed reliever
           problem.

                         
          Unanimous approval from the scouts --

                          BILLY
           Really?

                         

                          SCOUTS (UNISON)
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           I should get Rincon?

                          SCOUTS (UNISON)
           Definitely.

                         

                          BILLY
           Okay. I'll also come back with Joe
           DiMaggio and Ty Cobb. And who would like
           a Fabergé egg? Guys, you aren't hearing
           me -- in what universe can we afford
           Rincon?

                          (THEN)
           I'm asking you guys to look at this game
           differently than you've ever looked at it
           before. I'm going to Cleveland.

                          (MORE)

                          BILLY (CONT'D)
           And when I come back, I want you to tell
           me something I don't already know. I
           want to question everything. We've got
           to rethink this game.
           As he exits --

                         

                          BILLY
           And Grady? Nobody cares about a 102 win
           season.

                         
           Billy storms out.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           What's a Fabergé egg?

          A16 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL FIELD - DAY - FLASHBACK - 1980 A16


                         
           CRACK! A ball sails well over the heads of the SCOUTS in
           the outfield who are shagging the batting practice flies.
           The KIDS in the parking lot have seen Billy play before
           and so know just how far back to stand in order to shag a
           ball.

                         
           BILLY's at the plate, crushing pitches from a pitching
           machine.

                         
           CRACK!--he sends another one sailing over the heads of
           the cluster of scouts.

                         

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!
           BILLY, tanned and glistening with sweat, looks over to
           see THREE GIRLS watching him from behind the backstop.
           They're looking at him like he's Elvis and BILLY tries to
           nonchalant it but can't help a small smile to himself

                          BEFORE--

           CRACK!

           CRACK! CRACK!

                         

                          SABATINI
           This is the guy.

                         

                          MARTINEZ
           He's got a great path. I love the
           extension in his swing and the backspin
           he creates.

                          SABATINI
           That's some amazing power right there,
           huh?

                          MARTINEZ
           Good approach, great balance. How's he
           compare to the others around the country?

                         

                          SABATINI
           He's number one. Let's just hope he's
           still there when we pick.

                         

                          MARTINEZ
           This guy'll go in the first round.

           SABATINI and MARTINEZ are talking to BILLY, who's
           toweling off and is still a little aware of all the
           people who are standing nearby to watch the birth of a
           star.

                         

                          SABATINI
           Billy. I'm Sabatini, Area Scout, New
           York Mets. Can we get a couple minutes
           of your time, find out more about you?

                          BILLY
           Of course.

                          SABATINI
           I'd like to introduce you to Tom
           Martinez.

                         

                          MARTINEZ
           Very impressive performance today. In my
           job as the national cross-checker for the
           New York Mets, I see the top 200 players
           in the United States. It's been a while
           since I've seen a five tools guy, the
           complete package. Your throwing ability,
           your fielding skills... Ed told me you had
           power but I had no idea it was of the
           light tower variety. I hope you're as
           interested in professional baseball as we
           are in acquiring you in the upcoming
           draft.

                          BILLY
           Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with
           my parents, decide if baseball is
           something I want to do full time. I have
           a scholarship to play football at
           Stanford.

                         

                          MARTINEZ
           Well, Billy, we're certainly looking
           forward to meeting your folks and talking
           to them as well. And we believe in
           college, but that's something you can do
           in the winter months. You need to know
           the sky's the limit with your ability.
           You could be a superstar before you've
           even graduated. But to get to that
           level, you need to work with our people.
           Pro-ball is where you need to be to
           develop the skills God gave you.

          16 INT. RECEPTION - INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 16

           Unlike the A's, this is a franchise that can spend
           actual money on players, and on nice lobby furniture,
           which is where Billy sits, staring at a classic baseball
           photo that hangs in the lobby.

                         

                          ASSISTANT
           Mr. Beane? Mark's ready to see you now.

          18 INT. MARK SHAPIRO'S OFFICE - CLEVELAND - DAY 18


                         
           Billy's counterpart in Cleveland--Indians General Manager
           MARK SHAPIRO--35 and about three weeks into the job--sits
           behind his desk in a tie and shirt sleeves like Billy.
           Joining them in the room are FOUR OTHERS, including PETER

           BRAND.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           So Billy, what are you looking for?

                         

                          BILLY
           50 million in additional payroll.

                          SHAPIRO
           Try Giambi.

                         

                          BILLY
           Ouch.

           28.

           28.

                         

                         

                          SHAPIRO
          120 million.

                         

                          BILLY
          I should've been a hitter.

                          SHAPIRO
          Where's Steve in all this?

                          BILLY
          Supportive. Excited about rebuilding the
          team.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
          Bonds is available.

                          BILLY
          Yeah, how do I afford the rest of the
          field?

                         

                          SHAPIRO
          So what are you looking for? I want to
          help out.

                         

                          BILLY
          I guess you've touched the bottom of the
          sports industry when your opponent is

                         OFFERING YOU--

                         

                          SHAPIRO

                         BILLY--

                         

                          BILLY
          I need a lefty reliever and I want
          Ricardo Rincon.

                          SHAPIRO
          Not going to happen.

                         

                          BILLY
          Not even a discussion?

                         

                          SHAPIRO
          Come on Billy, even if you could afford
          him we're not about to let him go.

                          BILLY
          Why's that? You've got the Venezuelan
          kid in North Carolina you're bringing up.

                          SHAPIRO
          We dished him to Detroit. Keep up.

                         

                          BILLY
          Well there goes my other idea.

           29.

           29.

                         

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           What else you thinking Billy?

                         

                          BILLY
           You have any outfielders I should be
           looking at?

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           To replace Damon?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           That's a tough one Billy.

                          BILLY
           Yeah. Who do you got?

                          SHAPIRO
           The guys you might be able to afford?
           Hollins, Garcia... Coste.

                         

                          BILLY
           Tell me about Garcia.

                          SHAPIRO
           To replace Damon?!

                         

                          BILLY
           Is he healthy?

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           He had a back thing, some minor surgery,
           but he's okay. Petey?

                          PETEY
           He'll be good by Spring Training.

                         

                          BILLY
           He'll do. I can give you Guthrie for him
           if you kick in some cash.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           Mark Guthrie?

                         
          As Shapiro and gang review Guthrie's stats, Billy notices
          Peter whispering to the guy next to him.
          Shapiro looks around the room at the guys who don't
          object.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           How much are you thinking?

           30.

           30.

           BRUCE approaches Shapiro and whispers and steps away.

                          SHAPIRO
           Sorry about that. So... Garcia is going
           to be a no. What else are you thinking
           about?

                         

                          BILLY
           Let's make it work, I'll go straight up
           with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker.

                         
           Shapiro looks to Bruce, Peter is covering his mouth with
           his hand but we can just barely hear him whisper the word
           'no'. Bruce subtly shakes his head to Mark.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           Sorry Billy, who else you interested in?

                         

          19 INT. INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 19


                         
           Peter sits at his cubicle absorbed in his computer until
           he notices Billy hovering over him.

                          BILLY
           Hey.

                         

                          PETER
           Hi.

                          BILLY
           Who are you?

                         

                          PETER
           My name is Peter Brand.

                         

                          BILLY
           What do you do?

                         

                          PETER
           I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro.

                          BILLY
           So what do you do?
           (pointing at co-

                          WORKER)
           Hey, mind your own business.

                          (HE DOES)
           What do you do?

                         

                          PETER
           Mostly player evaluation right now.

           31.

           31.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Why does Mark listen to you?

                         

                          PETER
           Actually he rarely does.

                          BILLY
           He just did.

                          PETER
           I don't think he was really listening to
           me in there per se.

                         

                          BILLY
           Really?

                          PETER
           Yeah, I think he was listening to Bruce.

                          BILLY
           Who are you?

                         

                          PETER
           Peter Brand.

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't give a rat's ass about your name.

                         
          Nothing from Peter.

                          BILLY
           What happened in there?

                         

                          PETER
           I'm not sure what you're asking me.

                          BILLY
           What did you tell Butch?

                         

                          PETER
           Huh? Oh Bruce? I told him I like
           Garcia.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (BEAT)
           Why?

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
           Probably for the same reasons you do.

                         

                          BILLY
           Meaning what?

           32.

           32.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           He's undervalued. You were smart to go
           after him.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (LONG BEAT)
           What makes him undervalued?

                         
           Peter is stuck. He can't bring himself to say anything.
           After a long beat Billy nods to him in a way that seems
           to say, `I understand, it's okay'.

                          BILLY
           Come on.

                         
           Billy makes a strong gesture indicating Peter to follow.
           Which he does. They exit the offices into

                         

          20 INT. A VAST PARKING STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS 20


                          BILLY
           Where you from Peter?

           Maryland.

                         

                          BILLY
           Where did you go to school?

                          PETER
           Yale.

                         

                          BILLY
           I hate Yale.

                         

                          PETER
           Why?

                         

                          BILLY
           Kid from Yale once blocked a trade I was
           trying to make. What'd you study?

                         

                          PETER
           Economics.

                         

                          BILLY
           What are you doing in baseball?

                         

                          PETER
           I love baseball.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm just curious. Why were you so cagey
           in there?

           33.

           33.

                         

                         

                          PETER
          I work for a different team.

                         

                          BILLY
          I know, but I'm the first person in
          baseball who's ever talked to you this
          long. Right? Why is Garcia undervalued?

                         

                          PETER
          Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy
          to explain.

                         

                          BILLY
          Really? Why's that Peter?

                          PETER
          We might not see the game the same way.

                          BILLY
          Oh really? What do you mean by that?

                         

                          PETER
          You've spent your life in baseball and I
          don't have a very traditional view of the
          game.

                          BILLY
          Hey Pete, just say it. I'm not about to
          beat you up. Say what you've always
          wanted to say to a GM.

                          PETER
          Baseball thinking is medieval. It's stuck
          in the Dark Ages. I have a more
          scientific view of the game.

                          BILLY
          Keep going, Peter.

                         

                          PETER
          There is an epidemic failure within the
          game to understand what's really
          happening. And it leads people who run
          major league teams to misjudge their
          players and mismanage their teams.
          They're still asking the wrong questions.
          People who run baseball teams still think
          in terms of buying players. Sorry to say
          that.

                          BILLY
          Peter, don't apologize for what you
          believe.

           34.

                          PETER
           The goal shouldn't be to buy players,
           what you want to buy is wins. To buy
           wins, you buy runs. You're trying to
           replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at
           Johnny Damon and they see a star worth
           seven point five million a year. When I
           look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect
           understanding of where runs come from.

          he walks to the plate to adoring Oakland fans.

           PETER V/O
           His batting average is ignorable. What
           matters is his on base percentage-

                         
          DAMON swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left
          field for a single. He leads off first--

           PETER V/O
           - which in 2001 was .324. That's 10
           points lower than league average, and 17
           points lower than Garcia's.

                         
          On the next pitch, DAMON takes off for second--

                         

           PETER V/O
           True, he stole some bases. But attempted
           steals in general have to succeed 70% of
           the time before they even start to
           contribute to run totals. In 2001 he cost
           you runs.
          DAMON's tagged out at second.

                         

          BACK TO THE GARAGE

                         

                          PETER
           He's got a good glove. He's a decent
           leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's
           not worth the seven point five million
           Boston is paying him. You're lucky to
           have him off your payroll, it opens all
           kinds of interesting possibilities.

                          BILLY
           You read Bill James, Pete?

                         

                          PETER
           Yes. These ideas and this approach to the
           game aren't all new. In fact, some of
           them have been around for two decades.

           35.

                          BILLY
           If this approach has been around for so
           long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing
           them?

                          PETER
           That's a much more difficult question
           than how to win baseball games. Once you
           begin to pull at that string, your
           understanding of the world might begin to
           unravel.

           Billy's in coach, staring at the night through the
           window, lost in thought.

           Billy's mother and father escort Martinez and Mets Head
           Scout Roger Jongewaard into the kitchen.

                          MOTHER
           Billy? They're here.

                         

                          JONGEWAARD
           Billy... Good to see you again.
           Obviously you're a very special player.
           We'd like to compliment you on your high
           school career, and we're looking forward
           to you being a part of the Mets family.
           Jongewaard sits at the kitchen table, speaking more to
           Billy's parents than Billy himself --

                         

                          JONGEWAARD
           There's good -- and there's premium.
           Your son is premium. He has it all --
           power, speed, the arm. The Look -- and
           I'm never wrong about that. Which is why
           this is a premium number.
           He sets a contract on the table. Clipped to its top-
           sheet is a check. On its left-hand corner is the Mets
           insignia; on the right, the amount: $125,000. They all
           see it. A lot of money in 1980. Silence. Then --

                         

                          MOTHER
           Billy's been offered a scholarship to
           Stanford.

           36.

           36.

                         

                         

                          JONGEWAARD
           I know. And that's a great
           accomplishment. I'm sure you're very
           proud of him.

                          MOTHER
           So he can accept that, go there, and then -

                          -
           Jongewaard is already shaking his head no.

                         

                          JONGEWAARD
           I understand how important college is. I
           do. But what I can't do is burn a second
           first-round draft pick on someone who
           can't play for four years -- no matter
           how good he is. Four years is ample time
           for someone to get hurt. It happens all
           the time. So, no. I'm sorry. It has to
           be one or the other. To postpone four
           years is four years he could be in big
           leagues. The sooner he gets there the
           sooner he can reap the benefits.

                         
           Stanford or The Money. Young Billy regards the check,
           and then his parents. He really doesn't know what to do.

                          JONGEWAARD
           We're going to give him a different kind
           of education. This won't be his life's
           career, it'll be his first career. He's
           going to be a young guy in the business
           world when his baseball career is done.
           He'll still have his whole life ahead of
           him.

                          FATHER
           It's your decision, Billy. Whatever you
           decide is fine with us.

           BILLY's looking out his window while holding his cordless
           phone. He's dialed the numbers in and just has to hit the

           Hello?

                         

                          BILLY
           It's Billy Beane.

                          PETER
           What time is it?

                          BILLY
           I don't care. Would you have drafted me
           in the first round?

                         

                          PETER
           What?

                          BILLY
           After I left you ran me through your
           computer, right? Would you have drafted
           me in the first round?

                         

                          PETER
           You were a good baseball player.

                         

                          BILLY
           Would you have drafted me in the first
           round?

                         

                          PETER

                          (PAUSE)
           I'd have drafted you in the ninth round.
           No signing bonus. You'd have passed and
           gone to Stanford.

                         

                          BILLY
           Pack your suitcases.

                         

                          PETER
           Why?

                          BILLY
           I just bought you from the Cleveland
           Indians.

                         
           BILLY hangs up the phone. He sits all alone for a moment.

                         

          25 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - MORNING 25

           MONTAGE: Peter pulls into the parking lot for his first
           day of work, takes in the sight of the colossal, concrete
           relic that is the Oakland Coliseum. He's just in time to
           see a paint roller on a long pole laying a white stripe
           down the middle of Jason Giambi's giant portrait.

          26 INT. PETER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 26


                         
           PETER's completely converted the place. The dry erase
           boards are covered with undecipherable equations,
           algorithms and numbers and PETER, who's pretty tired now
           after not a lot of sleep, is in the middle of this.
           This is what BILLY sees when he walks into the doorway,
           where he slows down, stops and looks around blankly.

                          BILLY
           Good evening.

                         

                          PETER
           Good evening.

                         

                          BILLY
           I asked you to do three.

                         

                          PETER
           Yes.

                         

                          BILLY
           To evaluate three available players.

                         

                          PETER
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           And how many did you do?

                         

                          PETER

           47.

                         

                          BILLY

                          OKAY--

                          PETER
           51, I don't know why I lied just then.

                         

                          BILLY
           Talk me through the wall.
           PETER gets up and gives BILLY a tour of the dry erase
           boards.

                         

                          PETER
           This is the American League West. This
           year we're going to need to win between
           97 and 101 games to make the post season.
           Here's the number of runs we'll need to
           score in order to win those games and
           here's the number of runs we can allow.

           39.

           39.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
          Let's make sure we're on the same page.

                         

                          PETER
          Okay.

                          BILLY
          We're going to re-think baseball.

                          PETER
          Yes.

                         

                          BILLY
          Look for an inefficiencies in statistics.

                          PETER
          Examine the ways that runs are scored and
          prevented.

                          BILLY
          Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs
          are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs.

                         

                          PETER
          Unspectacular runs are more valuable.

                          BILLY
          Why?

                         

                          PETER/BILLY

                          (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
          Because they cost less.

                          BILLY
          We believe there's a river that hasn't
          been fished.

                         

                          PETER
          We know it for sure.

                          BILLY
          And because players have been overlooked
          because they don't rise to the standards
          of traditional baseball thinking, we
          believe that in this river, there are
          fish...fish who--
           (BILLY lost it)
          Help me with--

                         

                          PETER
          Forget the fish. In this room is every
          available player at every level of
          professional baseball, and somewhere in
          that group are 25 players that everyone
          has else has thrown out.

          An island of misfit toys. In this room is

                          BILLY
          Yes. But let me ask you this. If our
          theory is right--

                         

                          PETER
          Math isn't a theory.

                         

                          BILLY
          If it's right--

                         

                          PETER
          It's right.

                          BILLY
          It sounds right.

                          PETER
          It is right.

          It isn't.

                         

                          BILLY
          I'm gonna punch you in the kidneys if you
          don't let me finish a sentence.

                         

                          PETER
          Sorry.

                          BILLY
          If this is right, why isn't everybody
          doing it? In fact, why isn't anybody
          doing it?

                          PETER
          Somebody once said, "It's not what you
          don't know that worries me it's what you
          know for sure that's got me scared." In
          the mid-19th Century in Budapest there
          was an incredibly high instance of
          mothers dying shortly after childbirth
          from a disease called puerperal fever.

          35%.

                          BILLY
          Make this story less boring as soon as
          you can.

           41.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           A doctor named Semmelweiss showed that if
           the attending physicians and nurses
           sterilized their hands before delivery,
           the mortality rate dropped to 1%.

                          BILLY
           And he was vilified?

                          PETER
           He was institutionalized. For suggesting
           that washing your hands before putting
           them inside someone else's body was a
           good idea. High functioning people can
           live under the spell of an inexplicable
           mental lapse when they think as a group.
           Why isn't anybody else doing it? Because
           they don't think guys who look like you
           are what win baseball games. They know it
           for sure.

                         

                          BILLY

           Alright, let's find our team.

          27 INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY 27

           Peter schleps his computer stuff. Sets up, plugs in,
           fires up. Turns an unused room into a war room with dry
           erase boards and computers. He installs software in the
           video room computer, works on a computer in his room,
           prints two pages of data and reviews.

                         

                          CUT TO:

          28 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 28


                         
           Peter enters and hands the two pages to Billy. Billy
           reviews, stands, then slowly paces as he reads. Peter
           stands and watches.

          29 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 29


                         
           From somewhere in the outfield, we have a wide view of
           the darkened stadium and Billy's office, which, unlike
           the others, is illuminated. We can just discern Billy's
           silhouette as he continues to slowly pace and study.

          30 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - DAY 30


                         
           Billy and Peter walk down a long, subterranean corridor.
           Peter carries a laptop and a slim notebook.

                         

                          BILLY
           Nervous?

                          PETER
           No??

                          BILLY
           Huh. Interesting.

                         
           Peter doesn't know what to make of that.

          31 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCOUTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 31


                         
           As they near the scouting room, Billy sees ART HOWE
           waiting for him outside it.

                          BILLY
           Hey, Art.

                         

                          ART
           Can I talk to you a second before you get
           started.

                         

                          BILLY
           I got a lot to do.

                         

                          ART
           I know.
           Whatever it is, Billy knows it can't be as dire as his
           other problems, but also knows that to ignore Art would
           be to insult him.

                         
           He gestures for Peter to go into the scouting room alone.
           He'd rather not, but does. The scouts, assuming perhaps
           he's there to make coffee, ignore him. He finds a place
           to sit in a corner.

                         

                          ART
           Who's the kid?

                         

                          BILLY
           That's Peter.

                          ART
           I can't manage this team under a one-year
           contract.

                         

                          BILLY
           Sure you can.

           43.

           43.

                         

                         

                          ART
           No I can't.

                         

                          BILLY
           I've got to put a team on the field, then
           I'll deal with your contract.

                         

                          ART
           How about you deal with the manager's
           contract and then put a team on the
           field?

                         

                          BILLY
           At the moment, if a ground ball is hit to
           first base, nobody's going to be there to
           stop it from rolling.

                         

                          ART
           I have to tell you it's not easy doing
           what I do under the cloud of a one-year
           contract.

                         

                          BILLY
           I know. I been there.

                         

                          ART
           I know you have. And a 1-year contract
           says the same thing to a manager as it
           does to a player: There's not a lot of
           faith there. Which is strange after a
           102-win season.

                         

                          BILLY
           If you lose the last one of the season
           nobody gives a shit about the others.

                          ART
           It's on me now?

                         

                          BILLY
           It's on me, Art!

                          (BEAT)
           And the kid's the new assistant general
           manager.

                         

                          ART

                          (PAUSE)
           What the fuck are you about to do?
          BILLY doesn't answer the question, just walks into the-

          32 INT. SCOUTING ROOM - DAY 32


                         
           -and ignoring Peter - who has tried to inconspicuously
           plant himself in a corner - pulls up a chair to receive
           his scouts' report - which Grady, as always, will lead.
           Art wanders off.

                          GRADY
           How did it go in Cleveland?

                          BILLY
           It was cold.

                         
           The news bothers no one.

                         

                          GRADY
           Let's get after our relief pitching
           problem.

                         

                          BILLY
           We got Chad Bradford. Right-hander.

                         
           Few, if any of them, have heard of Bradford and begin
           leafing through their printouts and notes.

                         

                          GRADY
           Submariner?

                          BILLY
           That's the one. Technically an
           underhander.

                          GRADY
           What's his velocity?

                         

                          BILLY
           Unimpressive.

                          ARTIE
           About 85.

                         

                          GRADY
           Does he have a good breaking ball?

                         

                          BILLY
           Doesn't have one.

                         

                          GRADY
           Why do you like this guy?

                          BILLY
           Well, he gets people out.

           45.

                          ARTIE
           The left-hander hitters get a really good
           look at him.

                         

                          GRADY
           He's down there. He's down there real
           low, too.

                         

                          BILLY
           Let's move on.

                         
          The scouts aren't sure what to say, and so say nothing.

                         EVENTUALLY -

                         

                          GRADY
           Well, we, I think, have fared better. We
           have some ideas for what to do about
           Giambi.

                          BILLY
           Knock me down.

                         

                          GRADY
           We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a
           gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A
           big heart in the last year his contract.
           Tend to play hard. We usually get a
           pretty good year out of them. Make up
           for some of the offense we lost.
           (puts more names up)
           Or the other option. Just a thought. We
           go for a high-maintenance guy. A guy
           that's a little difficult but talented.
           A guy like Milton Bradley. Well, not
           like Milton. Milton himself. Which do
           you want to talk about first?

                         

                          BILLY
           None of them.
          Grady looks like a man who can't take much more.

                         

                          BILLY
           You're still looking to replace him;
           you're just saying it another way.

                          BARRY
           We got some trades here.

                          BILLY
           We can't do it. What we can do is
           recreate his value to us in the
           aggregate.

           46.

           46.

                         

                         

                          GRADY
           The (what) -

                         

                          BILLY
           Giambi's on-base percentage was .477.
           Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless
           his heart - was .291. Add that up and
           you get -
          He points to Peter.

                         

                          PETER
           You want me to speak?

                         

                          BILLY
           When I point at you, yes.

                         

                          PETER
           Ten-ninety-two.

                         

                          BILLY
           Divided by three -

                         

                          PETER
           Three-sixty-four.

                          BILLY
           That's what we're looking for. And
           that's what we'll find. Three players
           whose average OBP is -

                          PETER
           Three-sixty-four.

                         

                          ARTIE
           That doesn't come out right.

                          BILLY
           You gotta carry the one.

                         

                          ARTIE
           Still don't look right.

                          BILLY
           It's right.
          The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the
          logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room.

                         

                          GRADY
           Billy?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes.

           47.

           47.

                         

                         

                          GRADY
           Who's that?

                         

                          BILLY
           That's Peter.
          And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter.

                         

                          GRADY
           I don't know how to say this delicately -
           but does - Peter - need to be here?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes.

                          POLONI
           What's with this on base percentage
           obsession? Is that Bill James bullshit?

                          BILLY
           You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for
           all I care.

                         
          Billy takes a Marks-A-Lot, jots down three names on
          strips, and approaches the board.

                          BILLY
           So here's who we want. One.

                         
          He puts the first strip up. It reads: JEREMY GIAMBI.

                          BILLY
           Jason's little brother Jeremy.

                         

                          BARRY
           He never comes home from the games.

                         

                          POLONI
           Billy, if I may, he's had his problems on
           the field -- not to mention his problems
           off the field -- not to mention he's
           getting a little thick around the middle
           -- there's the stuff with the weed. He's
           at strip joints...

                         

                          GRADY
           This guy could start the year with an
           agent and end up with a parole officer
           for Christ's sake.

                          BILLY
           His on-base percentage is all we're
           looking at now and he gets on base an
           awful lot for someone who only costs
           $285,000 a year.

           48.

           48.

                         

                         

                          GEORGE
           He can't catch a ball in the outfield.
           I've seen him lose a ball in the
           moonlight.
          Billy puts up another name: DAVID JUSTICE.

                         

                          BILLY
           David Justice.

                         

                          GRADY
           Ten years ago he was a big name. He's
           going to really help our season tickets
           at the beginning of the year. But by
           June he's not going to be hitting his
           weight.

                         

                          PITTARO
           He's 36!

                         

                          ARTIE
           His legs are gone. He's a defensive
           liability. I question whether the bat
           speed is still there.

                         

                          BARRY
           Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline
           he's willing to eat up half his contract
           to get rid of him.

                          BILLY
           That's good.

                         

                          HOPKINS
           He's a fossil. With all due respect,
           bringing these three guys aboard is like
           putting bubble gum on a flat tire.

                         

                          GRADY
           And why do we want to be the ones to bail
           Justice out of his contract?

                         
          Billy points at PETER --

                         

                          PETER
           He gets on base.

                          GRADY
           I got 37 free agents who are better than
           those guys.

                         

                          BILLY
           Scott Hatteberg.

           49.

           49.

                         

                         

                          POTE
           Who?

                         

                          BILLY
           Exactly. Sounds like an Oakland A
           already. Yes, he's got a little damage
           in his elbow.

                         

                          GRADY
           Some damage? He can't throw.

                         

                          BILLY
           We're not interested in him for his arm
           anymore than we wanted Giambi for his.

                          GRADY
           Wait, you're talkin' about Hatteberg at
           first?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes.

                         

                          HOPKINS
           He's a career .260 hitter and the good
           part of his career is over.

                          BILLY
           I say it's just starting.

                         

                          PITTARO
           Well, Billy, you'll like the sound of
           this... I hear Boston wants to cut him
           and no one wants to pick him up.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's good news for us. He's cheap.

                         

                          GRADY
           Let me understand this. At first base
           you want a guy who's been cut from half
           of the minor league teams in the country
           due to irreparable nerve damage?

                          BILLY
           He can't hit and he can't field, but what
           can he do?

                          (BEAT)
           Look at the piece of paper or I'm going
           to point at Peter.
          The SCOUTS consult their spreadsheets and then answer

                         HALF-HEARTEDLY--

           50.

           50.

                         

                         

                          SCOUTS

                          (HALF-HEARTEDLY)
          He can get--

                         

                          BILLY
          He can get on base.

                         

                          POLONI
          Alright, so he walks a lot.

                         

                          BILLY
          He gets on base a lot, Rocco. Do I care
          if it's a walk or a hit?

                          PETER
          You do not.

                         

                          POLONI
          These three players, by your own
          admission, are defective in one way or
          another.

                         

                          BILLY
          Yeah.

                          GRADY
          You want to replace Jason Giambi with not
          one but three defective players?

                         

                          BILLY
          You got it.

                          GRADY
          Billy, we've all been busting our asses
          the last six and a half weeks to make
          this a better ball--

                         

                          BILLY
           (cutting him off)
          Grady, it's not a discussion.

                          POTE
          I think we're all losing sight of the
          fact that you're the general manager.
          You only have to answer to ownership and
          God.

                          BILLY
          I didn't know God followed baseball.

                         

                          POTE
          I hope he does.

           51.

           51.

                         

                         
           Some of the scouts look over in Peter's direction, no
           doubt wondering if he's had something to do with their
           general manager's ideas.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Billy, I just don't see it.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's okay, Wash. We won't be victimized
           by what we see anymore.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           I understand what you're saying about
           their averages, but there's something
           you're forgetting. None of them plays
           first base.

                         

                          BILLY
           I haven't forgotten that, Wash. One of
           them is going to have to learn.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Learn.

                         

                          BILLY
           You're going to have to teach him.

                          WASHINGTON
           Teach.

                          BILLY
           Instruct.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Which one?

                         

          33 EXT/INT. TACOMA HOUSE - NIGHT 33

           A Christmas tree. Four stockings hang from the mantle.
           The phone rings. SCOTT HATTEBERG gets up. He looks at it.
           Looks at his wife. Picks it up.

                         

                          SCOTT
           Hello?

                         

                          BILLY (VO)
           Scott?

                          SCOTT
           Yes?

                         

                          BILLY (VO)
           It's Billy Beane. Oakland A's.

                         
           SCOTT was expecting that it would be someone else...

           52.

           52.

                         

                         

                          SCOTT
           Yes?

                         

                          BILLY (VO)
           Can we talk?

                          SCOTT
           Yes.

                          BILLY (VO)
           You want to invite me in?

                         

                          SCOTT
           What?

                          BILLY (VO)
           I'm outside. I can see you in the window.
           SCOTT goes to the window and cups his hands against the
           glass to see outside.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Honey?

                         
           Two silhouettes are standing on the edge of the fairway.
           One of them waves.

          34 INT. SCOTT HATTEBERG'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT 34

           ELIZABETH is putting out some cookies shaped like stars
           and bells for the late-night guests: BILLY and RON

           WASHINGTON.

                          BILLY
           Thank you, ma'am.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Thank you, ma'am.

                         
           She leaves her husband with the two men but listens in on
           their conversation from the next room, nibbling on a
           cookie of her own.

                         

                          BILLY
           You've played catcher your whole life?

                         

                          SCOTT
           Since I was 8.
           BILLY produces a baseball from his windbreaker and hands
           it to SCOTT. SCOTT can only manage to grip the baseball
           like a claw. Washington looks to heaven.

                         

                          BILLY
           How's the elbow?

           53.

           53.

                         

                         

                          SCOTT
           Good. Real good. It's great.

                          (FUCK IT)
           I can't throw at all.

                          BILLY
           Yeah, don't worry about it. You've thrown
           your last baseball from behind the plate.
           I want you at first.
          SCOTT is so thrown by this that all he can do is stare at
          BILLY. Then at WASHINGTON, who's shrug tells SCOTT "This
          wasn't my idea."

                          SCOTT
           I've only ever played catcher.

                         

                          BILLY
           You're not a catcher anymore. If you
           were, then mine wouldn't have been the
           only call you got when your contract
           expired at midnight.

                         

                          SCOTT
           I appreciate it but--

                         

                          BILLY
           You're welcome.

                         

                          SCOTT

                          YOU SEE--

                          BILLY
           You don't know how to play first base.

                          SCOTT
           That's right.

                         

                          BILLY
           It's not that hard. Tell him, Wash.

                          WASHINGTON
           It's incredibly hard!

                         

                          BILLY
           Anything worth doing is. Wash is gonna
           teach you.

                         

                          SCOTT
           Wait a minute, what about--

                         

                          BILLY
           Jason's gone, Scott.

           54.

           54.

                         

                         

                          SCOTT
           I'm taking Giambi's spot at first? What
           about the fans?

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Yeah, maybe I can teach one of them.

                         

                          BILLY
           The fans don't run--

                          (TO WASHINGTON)

                          --GOOD ONE--
           (back to SCOTT)
           --the fans don't run my ball club.

                          SCOTT
           They're gonna hate me.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           (motioning to BILLY)
           No, they're gonna hate him.

                          BILLY
           The fans love me.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Okay.

                         
          HATTEBERG's YOUNG DAUGHTER comes down the staircase in
          her pajamas, having just woken up in the middle of the
          night.

                         

                          BILLY
           Hello.

                         

                          HATTEBERG'S DAUGHTER
           Hi.

                         

                          SCOTT
           That's our youngest daughter.

                          BILLY
           Great.

                          SCOTT
           Do you have kids?

                         
          BILLY doesn't like to share personal lives with the
          players but he covers well--

                         

                          BILLY
           --yeah, I have a daughter.

                         
          BILLY takes a contract out of his windbreaker and sets it
          on the table next to the cookies.

           55.

           55.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           This is a contract for you to play
           baseball with the Oakland A's. A copy's
           on its way to your agent. Discuss it with
           your wife and let us know.
           (They get up and
           Billy calls off)
           Thanks for the cookies, ma'am.
           We see ELIZABETH with tears running down her face...then
           go back to the living room--

                         

           ELIZABETH (O.S.)
           You're welcome.

                          BILLY
           (on his way out)
           Merry Christmas.

          35 EXT./INT. SAN DIEGO - PRESENT DAY 35


                         
           The door of a suburban house opens, revealing a WOMAN.

                         

                          BILLY
           Hi.

                         

                          SHARON
           Hi, Billy.

                         
           She pulls the door open so he can come in. As he does -

                          BILLY
           She home?

                          SHARON
           She's out, but she'll be home soon.

                         

          36 INT. SAN DIEGO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 36


                         
           As Billy enters his ex-wife Sharon's house, her husband
           ALAN walks in, talking on the phone.

                          ALAN

                          (ON PHONE)
           Yeah, no, don't worry about it sweetie.
           Here's mom.

                         
           Alan hands Sharon the phone.

                          BILLY
           Hey Alan.

                         

                          ALAN
           Come on in have a seat. Want some coconut
           water? It's really refreshing.

           56.

           56.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm all set, thanks.

                         

                          ALAN
           What are you benching now?

                          BILLY
           I don't keep count.

                          ALAN
           Well, whatever it is, it's working. You
           look good.

                         
          They sit on the couch next to a Christmas tree.

                          ALAN
           I haven't got to see you since the
           playoffs in New York. That was
           heartbreaking, Billy. We were rooting for
           you.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (BEAT)
           Yep.

                         

                          ALAN
           You know what I say?

                         

                          BILLY
           Fuck `em.

                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry Alan, what do you say?

                         

                          ALAN
           No, I just wanted to say that a lot of
           teams don't get that far, and to make it
           that far is a really big accomplishment.

                         
          Sharon gets off the phone and joins them.

                          BILLY

                          (TO SHARON)
           So how is she?

                         

                          SHARON
           She's great. Be here in a minute. How's
           the team shaping up?

                         

                          BILLY
           New beginnings. Blue horizons.

                         

                          ALAN
           I read that you lost two players. Damon

                          AND -

                          (MORE)

           57.

           57.

                         

                          ALAN (CONT'D)

                          (MISPRONOUNCES)
           Ghee-ambi?

                         

                          SHARON
           Giambi. Wow, that's tough. That's really
           tough.

                         

                          BILLY
           And Isringhausen.

                         

                          ALAN
           Sounds tough.

                         

                          BILLY
           So where is she?

                          ALAN
           I just talked to her on her cell. She's
           just coming up the hill, she's two
           minutes away.

                         

                          BILLY
           You bought her a cell phone?

                         

                          SHARON
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           At 12?

                          ALAN
           Just for emergencies. I'm sorry, we
           should have consulted you for that

                          DECISION-

                          BILLY
           It's probably a good idea.

                         

                          SHARON
           But actually I called you -
           The front door opens. It's Billy's daughter Casey - a pre-
           teen indie-rock girl - and not a moment too soon. He's
           up quickly to give her a hug and to get out of here.

                         

                          BILLY
           Let's go shopping.

                         

          37 INT. GUITAR CENTER - LA MESA - DAY 37


                         
           Billy and Casey peruse guitars.

                         

                          BILLY
           You want one with nylon strings, right?

           58.

           58.

                         

                         

                          CASEY
           I like the red ones.

                         

                          BILLY
           How about this?

                          CASEY
           Yeah, that's cool.

                          BILLY
           Let's try it out over here.

                         
          They take a seat. Casey easily fingers through a very
          tough spray of notes.

                          BILLY

                          (GENUINELY IMPRESSED)
           Casey.

                          CASEY
           Yeah.

                         

                          BILLY
           You got good.

                         

                          CASEY
           I've just been playing a lot.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's... that's not the way most 12 year
           olds play.

                         

                          CASEY
           Alan thinks I should have a better
           teacher.

                          BILLY
           Who's Alan?

                         
          CASEY looks at him --

                          BILLY
           Oh, yeah. Mom's Alan. What's wrong with
           the teacher you have now?

                         

                          CASEY
           Alan thinks I should be working more on
           technique so I don't learn bad habits.

                          BILLY
           Well, you seem to be doing just fine to
           me. Do you like playing?

                         

                          CASEY
           I love it.

           59.

           59.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           That's so great. I'm so happy for you.
           The most important thing in life is to
           find something you love and do it well.
           Do you like your teacher?

                          CASEY
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           Okay, I'll talk to Mom and Alan. Do you
           like that guitar?

                         

                          CASEY
           Yes!

                          BILLY
           That the one?

                          CASEY
           Yeah, I think so.

                         

                          BILLY
           Let's get it. Let's get it now.

                         

                          CASEY
           Really?

                         

                          BILLY
           Merry Christmas.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          38 EXT. DODGER STADIUM 38


                         

                          LEGEND: 1984
           BILLY's at the plate, a batting helmet snug around his
           head, wearing a METS uniform, as a 97 mph fastball buzzes
           by him and the UMPIRE calls--

                          UMPIRE
           Striiike!

                         
           BILLY steps out of the box, taps the dirt off his cleats
           and steps back in.

                         
           A younger-looking SHARON is sitting in field level seats,
           looking on nervously and trying not to show it.
           BILLY half-swings at the breaking ball, holding his swing
           at the last minute.

           60.

           60.

                         

                         
           The CATCHER and PLATE UMPIRE both point down to first
           base for the call and the FIRST BASE UMPIRE makes a fist
           in the air, indicating that Billy swung.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           Striiike!

                         
           And Billy's out.
           SHARON holds her head in her hands and BILLY walks back
           to the dugout, passing a player with "STRAWBERRY" on his
           back.

                         
           And now the quick scenes of failure become staccato--

           ...Billy Beane, who's quickly
           establishing a new record for breaking
           bats, bat racks and water coolers, was
           actually a much-touted first round pick
           of the New York Mets in 1980 but the
           majors have not been kind to him with
           only 18 plate appearances in two years

           good memory you might remember that Billy
           Beane was taken in the first round of the

           from All-Star outfielder Daryl Strawberry
           by only 14 picks, so it just goes to
           show...

           BILLY looks up at SHARON in the seats behind the dugout
           but the two can't quite meet each other's eyes.

          47 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - DAY 47


                         
           In the subterranean video room - an even less elegant
           place than the rest of the stadium - someone has put up a
           scraggly Christmas tree. There, Peter watches a tape of
           a minor leaguer on the Lowell Spinners, a Single-A Boston
           affiliate. Billy comes in.

                         

                          PETER
           How'd it go?

                         

                          BILLY
           How'd what go?

                          PETER
           Hatteberg.

                         

                          BILLY
           He can barely hold a baseball. But he's
           our guy now.
           Billy sits.

                         

                          BILLY
           Who's that?

                         

                          PETER
           That is Kevin Youkilis. This is the guy
           we want more than anyone else in the
           world.

                         
           Billy watches the guy on the screen. He's an overweight
           right-handed batter with a peculiar stance.

                         

                          PETER
           He can't run, throw or field. But he
           walks more than anyone in baseball except
           Barry Bonds. Take out intentional walks
           and it's more than Bonds. He's the Greek
           God of Walks.

                         
           On the TV, the batter takes another pitch just off the
           edge of the strike zone.

           63.

           63.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last
           June. He said he waddled like a duck.
           Boston took him. Boston won't let him go
           yet. They're going to wait and see.

                         
           They watch him lay off a pitch an inch outside the strike
           zone. Peter gives Billy a look that says, You see that?

                         

                          PETER
           You all right, Billy?

                         

           GRADY O/S
           Billy?
           Grady has appeared behind them at the door.

                         

                          GRADY
           Can we talk a minute?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                          (TO PETER)
           Yeah.

                         

          48 INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 48


                         
           Grady closes the video room door for privacy. The only
           other person in sight is manager Art Howe, in his office
           in street clothes. He shuts his windowed door so Grady
           and Billy can talk in confidence.

                         

                          GRADY
           Your boy and I had a talk while you were
           in Tacoma. I didn't like much of what I
           heard.

                          BILLY
           No?

                          GRADY
           No. You got a kid in there with a Yale
           economics degree and a scout out here
           with 29 years baseball experience and
           you're listening to the wrong one.

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't listen to anyone, you know that.

                          GRADY
           This isn't a joke.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm not joking.

                          GRADY
           This isn't how you run a ball club, with
           a computer. You know that. You're a
           baseball man. There are intangibles
           that only a scout can see in a player
           that you're not going to pick up with
           just numbers, with someone who doesn't
           play the game, who knows nothing about
           the game but how to feed numbers into a
           computer.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's what we're doing. That's exactly
           what we're doing.

                          GRADY
           If this is what baseball is, if it's not
           Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two
           bad legs because the manager felt in his
           heart that he had one swing left in that
           body... a computer wouldn't do that.
           They would have had him sitting up in the
           stands.

                         

                          BILLY
           A computer doesn't romanticize the sport.
           Leave that for the fans.

                         

                          GRADY
           Well, romance and the fans, it's called a
           love affair with the game and it's been
           going on for one hundred and fifty years.

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't want to hurt you love affair with
           the game. Just because we've been doing
           it one way for a hundred and fifty years
           doesn't mean we've been doing it right.
           You have any idea how long people thought
           the sun revolved around the earth? To
           your eyes it looks like that's what's
           happening.

                         

                          GRADY

          Grady, you don't have special powers. You
          don't have the ability to look at a guy
          and "just know" because you're a scout
          with special powers. I've watched you sit
          at kitchen tables for years and tell the
          parents of a 17 year old kid, "Trust me,
          when I know, I know, and when it comes to
          your son, I know" and you don't. We're
          shopping in a new store--full of
          complicated statistical analysis and
          equations and I get that it turns your
          world upside down but on base percentage--
          our best chance to score on our budget
          isn't getting a 6'4" Adonis to the plate,
          it's getting a 5'10" washout who's
          already at first base.

           after this catastrophic season you're

           why you're working at Dick's Sporting
           Goods.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.

                         

                          GRADY
           Go fuck yourself, Billy.

           Well now maybe.

                         
           GRADY takes off.
           BILLY stands there a moment. On his way out, passing
           Art's windowed office, he exchanges a look with the
           manager. Billy takes a short walk to where a few of his
           scouts are standing around an arcade console. To the
           youngest one -

                         

                          BILLY
           Eric. You never even played high school
           ball, right?

                         
           The young scout shakes his head, embarrassed.

                          BILLY
           Grady's gone. You're the new Head Scout.

                         
           Billy turns away and is headed back to the video room.
           Pokes his head in.

                         

                          BILLY
           Don't try to explain things to scouts.
           They're not programmed to get it. It's
           just us.

                         
           He leaves. Peter watches the door close, then glances
           back to the tape as Youkilis takes ball four and waddles
           down to first base.

           Billy, will the fans still come out now
           that you've lost Giambi?

                          BILLY
           I don't know, Graham. Will they listen to
           your insipid radio show?

           MIKE MAGNANTE goes through the effort of putting on his
           knee-braces. Scott Hatteberg, lacing up, watches him.

          49 EXT. PHOENIX MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY 49


                         
           Various stations have been set up at which infielders go
           through their warm-ups - wind sprints, arm loosening.
           Infielders field grounders hit by Art Howe from a fungo.

                         
           Billy paces in the foul territory off the first base
           line. HIS POV: JEREMY GIAMBI missing a fly ball, DAVID
           JUSTICE looking tired, HATTEBERG missing the scoop.
           Art hits another grounder which Hatteberg botches again.
           Art looks at Billy a good long beat, then hits to another
           infielder.

                         
           Peter walks up to Billy, just as -
           A poke off the bat sends Jeremy Giambi scrambling back
           like a postman trying to escape a mad dog. The ball
           lands behind him.

                          BILLY
           Well, we didn't pay him for his defense.

                         
           Art and Washington hit grounders to Carlos Pena and Scott
           Hatteberg. Hatteberg miraculously gets his mitt on it.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's the way, Hatte. Pickin' Machine.

                         
           Behind a portable backstop, a guy with a radar gun gets
           ready to clock a trio of relievers. Mike Magnante has
           his pant legs pulled up to adjust knee-braces. Magnante
           gets up and begins throwing, increasing his velocity each
           time.

                         

                          BILLY
           None of those broke 85.

           68.

           They watch the second pitcher - the gentle-faced kid from
           the locker room - Chad Bradford - step up.

                         

                          BILLY
           Chad I have high hopes for.
           Bradford overthrows his first submarine hand-scraping-
           the-ground pitch, and the ball sails wide of the catcher.
           Somebody ducks. Art Howe glances with a long-suffering
           look to Billy.

                          BILLY
           It just got away from him.

                         
           They watch David Justice do wind sprints.

                          BILLY
           He's still got it.

                         
           Then Justice stops, winded.

           As the players shower and change into street clothes,
           Art, Billy and Washington discuss Hatteberg, who knows
           they're discussing him.

                          BILLY
           It's the first day of week one. There's
           nothing to judge yet.

                         

                          ART
           I can judge it and so can you. First
           base is the moon to him.

                         

                          BILLY
           It wasn't to Giambi? He's the worst
           first baseman in baseball. What do you
           think of him, Wash?

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           The nicest way I can put it is, he lacks
           confidence.

                          BILLY
           Work with him Wash.

                          WASHINGTON
           I'll do that, Billy, but we've got Pena
           who can play first. And he's looking
           pretty good out there.

                         

                          BILLY
           I want to make it work with Hatte, Wash.

           69.

           69.

                         

                         
           As Washington crosses the locker room to lie to Scott
           about how much progress he's making, he passes Magnante
           taking off his knee braces, and Chad Bradford sitting at
           his locker with a Bible in his lap.

                          ART
           Not to mention we already have a first
           baseman.

                          BILLY
           A rookie first baseman. It's not the
           same.

                         

                          ART
           Number 11 on the Top 100 Prospects list.

                          BILLY
           Lists aren't baseball.

                          ART
           Catchers at first base aren't baseball.
           Who's idea was this? Peter's?

                         

                          BILLY
           Hatteberg will be fine, Art.

                          ART
           He will be fine, you're right. Pinch
           hitting while Pena plays first base.

          58 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD LEVEL - DAY 58

           The CROWD CHEERS as the A's take the field. Billy and
           Peter are at the edge of the tunnel, watching.

                         

                          BILLY
           Okay, good.

                          (BEAT)
           I'm heading in.

                          PETER
           Why?

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't watch the games.

                         

                          PETER
           Is this a joke?

                         
           BILLY shakes his head "no". PETER gestures "What the fuck
           are you talking about?"

                          BILLY
           I don't know what you're miming.

           74.

                          PETER
           I'm miming "You don't watch the games?!"

                         

                          BILLY
           This is my team. And they've taken the
           field. They're world class athletes who
           are fighting for their lives and I stand
           with them. Except not literally so I need
           you to text me what Art does.

                         
           BILLY walks out onto--

           BILLY's watching the game on TV (ARCHIVAL VIDEO) with the
           sound off but we can hear the live crowd in the stadium.
           CRACK--a TEXAS RANGER hits a three-run homer and BILLY
           walks out of the room and

                          CUT TO:

           An OAKLAND A hits an easy pop-up to center field and

           Where BILLY's on a stationary bike. His blackberry buzzes
           and he takes a look--

                         
           "Fly out to cntr"

           Where an OAKLAND A has just hit a ground ball to the
           SHORTSTOP, who tosses it easily to second for the first
           out, and the SECOND BASEMAN throws it over to first for--

           The blackberry goes crashing into the wall and blows
           apart.

           We find Billy and Art in conversation.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah. I should have made you a bigger
           part of the conversation, I should have
           had you in the scout meetings from the
           first day, that way you would have
           understood this better and that was
           another mistake, I take full
           responsibility.

                         

                          ART
           What are you trying to say?

                          BILLY
           It doesn't matter what moves I make if
           you don't play the team the way I need
           them played.

                         

                          ART

                          BILLY -

                          (LONG BEAT)
           You are out of your depth.

                          BILLY
           Why wasn't Hatteberg at first?

                         

                          ART
           Because he can't play first.

                          BILLY
           How do you know?

                         

                          ART
           Not my first baseball game.

                          ART--

                         

                          ART
           Scott Hatteberg can't hit.

                         

                          BILLY
           He gets on--

           76.

           76.

                         

                         

                          ART
           And his defense--

                         

                          BILLY
           Still keeps us in the plus column and we
           only need to be 7 over 500.

                         

                          ART
           Anything else?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah, I would have rather seen Chad
           Bradford in there at the end than
           Magnante.

                          ART

                          BRADFORD'S--

                          BILLY
           I don't care about righty/lefty.

                         

                          ART
           I do.

                         

                          BILLY
           This is about your contract?

                          ART
           No, you've made it clear what you think
           about that. This is about you doing your
           job and me doing mine. Mine's being left
           alone to manage the beer league team you
           assembled for me.

                         

                          BILLY
           I didn't assemble them for you, I
           assembled them for me.

                         

                          ART
           No shit.

          66 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - DAY 66


                         

                          BILLY
           I want you to go on the road with the
           team.

                          PETER
           You don't go on the road with the team.

                          BILLY
           That's why I want you to do it.

                         

                          PETER
           Why don't you?

           77.

           77.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
          I don't want to develop personal
          relationships. I need to trade them, send
          them down and sometimes cut them. You
          should learn how to do that by the way.

                          PETER
          The only way I'd have to cut a player is
          if you oh come on!

                         

                          BILLY
          Yeah, let's practice.

                         

                          PETER
          No.

                          BILLY
          I'm a player, cut me from the roster.

                         

                          PETER
          No.

                         

                          BILLY
          Do it.

                         

                          PETER
          This is stupid.

                         

                          BILLY
          Man-up, Yale.

                         

                          PETER
          Fine. Billy, would you have a seat for a
          moment, I need to talk to you.

                          BILLY
          I'm already sitting.

                          PETER
          I was pretending you weren't sitting.

                         

                          BILLY
          But I am. Keep going.

                          PETER
          This is the hardest thing there is to do
          in baseball.

                          BILLY
          You got that from Bull Durham?

                         

                          PETER
          Yeah.

           78.

           78.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
          Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing
          there is to do in baseball but go ahead.

                         

                          PETER
          You've been a huge part of this team but
          decisions have to be made that are best
          for the team, I'm sure you can understand
          that.

                         

                          BILLY
          You're cutting me?

                         

                          PETER
          I'm really sorry.

                          BILLY
          I just bought a house here.

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
          Well...

                         

                          BILLY
          Well? That's all you have to say? My kids
          just started at a new school, they made
          friends.

                         

                          PETER
          That's--I'd leave them in school, you
          don't want to take them out in the middle

                         OF THE--

                         

                          BILLY
          What the hell are you doing?

                          PETER
          Are you you or the player?

                         

                          BILLY
          I'm me. You're talking about kids and
          schools and you should've been out of the
          room three minutes ago.

                         

                          PETER
          Shouldn't I tell them that they'll always
          be a part of the A's family?

                         

                          BILLY
          That makes me feel so good I'm thinking
          of burning your house down with you in
          it. These are professional baseball
          players. You just do it. "Peter, I need
          to let you go. Jack's office'll handle
          the paperwork."

                          PETER
           That's it?

                         

                          BILLY
           Would you rather get one bullet in the
           head or five in the chest and bleed to
           death?

                         

                          PETER
           Those are my only choices?

                         

                          BILLY
           Go on the road with the team.

           DAVID JUSTICE is sitting next to PETER, who scrolls down
           stats on his laptop.

                         

                          DAVID
           How come your boss doesn't travel with
           the team?

                          PETER
           He doesn't like to mingle with the
           players.

                          DAVID
           Makes us easier to cut?

                         
           PETER doesn't say anything...

                         

                          DAVID
           He's gonna make some moves if we keep
           losing.
           PETER gives a small "Yeah" shrug...

                         

                          DAVID
           How come soda costs a dollar in the

           Billy likes to keep the money on the

           Soda money?

           It's hard to see.

           TV ANNOUNCER V/O
           The A's begin their first road trip of
           the season having dropped 7 of their
           first 11 games at home and their schedule
           doesn't get any easier from here. If
           there's a bright spot it's rookie first
           baseman Carlos Pena.

                         
           Billy turns off the T.V., gets beeper updates as he works
           out.

           BILLY's waiting for someone. HE'S WATCHING THE A'S GAME
           BY THE GATE. A PASSENGER, also watching the game,
           recognizes Billy.

                          PASSENGER
           Hey, aren't you Billy Beane?

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

                          PASSENGER
           Shouldn't you be at the game?

                          BILLY
           Nope.

                         
           CASEY emerges from the gate, sees her father before he
           sees her and runs to him. They hug.

                          CASEY
           Hey, Dad.

                          BILLY
           Hey, honey... I'm glad to see you.

           BILLY and PETER are throwing a ball through their office
           doors on either side of the hallway--

                          PETER
           It's not a big enough sample yet. I want
           to wait until we play more games.

           Casey sits at the table as Billy scoops ice cream.

                          BILLY
           Do you want strawberry or vanilla?

                         

                          CASEY
           Both.

                         

                          BILLY
           Don't tell your mother.

                          (THEN)
           If you could only have one ice cream for
           the rest of your life, which would you
           choose?

                          CASEY
           Vanilla. Definitely vanilla.

                         

                          BILLY
           Interesting. Chocolate sauce?

                          CASEY
           Yup.
          A beat. Then --

                         

                          CASEY
           Dad... if you could choose between the
           power of invisibility or flight, which
           would you choose?

                          BILLY
           Flight. Yeah, I'd wanna fly. You?

                          CASEY
           I think I'd want invisibility.

                         

                          BILLY
           Really? Why?

                         

                          CASEY
           I don't know. People wouldn't notice me
           as much.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why wouldn't you want people to notice
           you?

                         

                          CASEY
           I don't know.

                          BILLY
           Well, I guess you could sneak up on
           people. Or eavesdrop on their
           conversations. You could be a spy.

                          (THEN)
           So how's school?

                         

                          CASEY
           My teacher's kinda mean. She doesn't
           like us to ask questions.

                          BILLY
           What kind of teacher doesn't let you ask
           questions?

                         

                          CASEY
           I know, right? Mom was mad, too. She
           thinks maybe I should be home schooled.

           83.

           83.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Wouldn't you miss your friends?

                         

                          CASEY
           Yeah. But the other kids are mean.

                          BILLY
           There are always going to be bullies.
           Try not to let them get to you. But let
           me know if it's becoming a problem.

                         

                          CASEY
           Can I ask you a question? Are you still
           chewing tobacco?

                          BILLY
           Yeah...

                          CASEY
           Please stop.

                         

                          BILLY
           I know, it's terrible. Look, I promise
           I'll quit in November if you promise not
           to worry about it.

                          CASEY
           Pinkie swear?

                         

                          BILLY

           As Art trudges toward the mound to pull his starter, he
           touches his left arm. Magnante emerges from the pen -

           Alright. Be good.

                         

                          CASEY
           Okay.
          Billy's Blackberry chimes. He ignores it.

                          (PAUSE)
           I feel like--

                          (PAUSE)
           You feel like what?

                          BILLY

                          (BEAT)
           I don't know, did we talk enough this
           time?

                         

                          CASEY
           About what?

                         

                          BILLY
           Anything. Did we talk about the things
           you want to talk about, did we have fun?

                          BILLY
           Okay.

           I love you, Dad.

                         

                          BILLY
           You're doing it right now.

                          CASEY
           What?

                         

                          BILLY
           You're worrying about me.

                          CASEY
           Sorry.

                          BILLY
           Do I look like I'm worried?

           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           `Cause you're getting on an airplane and
           those things crash all the time. Will
           you please stop worrying about your
           father? You're a kid, I can't have it.

                          CASEY
           Okay. Can I worry about the airplane now
           though?

                         

                          BILLY
           Absolutely.

                         
           A FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches --

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           We're all set.

                          BILLY
           Great.

                         
           There's a slightly awkward moment and CASEY isn't sure
           whether she's supposed to hug her father again and so
           they do a sort of half-hug.

                         

                          BILLY
           I love you.
           BILLY watches her go off with the attendant, feeling like
           it was an unsatisfying visit.

                         
           He looks at his blackberry--
           3-2. Magnante in.

                          (SHOUTING)
           No! WHY IS HE IN THERE?!

                         
           EVERYONE in the area stops to look at the madman.

           (to the people
           looking at him)
           No no. I'm alright.

           Billy runs the warning track with a small radio that he
           turns on long enough to follow what's happening, and
           switches it off again.

          Listen, it's a team of probabilities, and
          we're gonna need 162 games to tell that
          tale in a nascent form. It's phase one,
          we're evolving and we feel confident
          where we're heading.

          3 out of 17 games. 3. We're getting
          crucified in the press. What makes you
          think this is gonna turn around?

                          BILLY
          Because I believe in what we're doing. I
          believe the numbers. I believe the record
          doesn't accurately reflect the team and
          where we're going to be at the end of the
          season. Peter and I feel very strongly
          that we need to stick to the game plan,
          and you can tell your partners to start
          booking their tickets to the playoffs.

          nearly crippled, who couldn't get hired
          as an usher in a ballpark now playing on
          the team. Give me something I can go back
          to these guys with and feel like I have
          the confidence that you're gonna turn
          these things around.

                         

                          BILLY
          With all due respect you asked me to
          build a team with shoelaces and gum
          wrappers and we've done it.

          You haven't done it yet billy.

                         

                          BILLY
          And it will pay off. Stick with us.
          Suffer the blows. Listen, life with no
          money means we're gonna have to suffer a
          few embarrassments along the way, but we
          are okay in the end.

                         

                          SCHOTT

           Our goal and our expectation by the All
           Star break is to be within seven games of
           first place.

                         

                          BILLY
           That'll keep us in the hunt.

           And that would be this working

           7 within 500. By July. And what's going
           to keep us from getting there?

                         

                          BILLY
           Nothing Steve.

                          SCHOTT
           Nothing. We're 3 for 17 right now. You've
           got to be able to give me a little bit
           more to go back to my partners with.

                          BILLY
           Listen, you hired me to do this job and
           that's where we're going to be.

                         

                          SCHOTT

           you imagine is going to happen if things
           don't turn around?

                          BILLY
           It's very clear, Steve. If I put myself
           in your shoes, I'd spend another 20
           million on the team.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           We don't have another 20 million

                          SCHOTT
           I gotta be honest with you, Billy, I wish
           you had a little more worry and a little
           more fear. Because things aren't going in
           our direction right now.

          to win Rookie of the Year.

                          BILLY
          No, Hatte - as opposed to the guy who
          gets on base less. Pena getting voted
          Rookie of the Year and the A's making the
          playoffs are two entirely different--

                         

                          ART
          Pena's not just the best first baseman on
          the roster, he's the only first baseman
          on the roster and the most valuable
          member on this team.

                          BILLY

          Listen to me--gets on base more than
          Pena. 25% more.

                          ART
          It does matter and Pena only has one
          error in 70 games.

                         

                          BILLY
          Not only is that number statistically
          insignificant but it's also subjective.
          It measures what someone did against what
          someone else thought they were supposed
          to do.

           his silence is worse. Art has to break it -

                          ART
           It's just one game.

           No, the point - as you said - is to win.

           a CD of funk music as he dresses, until he becomes aware

           Getting swept by the Red Sox at home.
           Having Long lead off the ninth with a
           triple in a one-run game and not being
           able to score a runner from first with
           nobody out, is that fun?

           No.

           for?!

           Sure.

           Maybe real estate.

           I'll be honest, if I don't make it in
           baseball I don't think I'm going to be
           able to afford much real estate.

           Billy's seated at his desk. Peter reluctantly dials a
           number from a list, the number across from the Phillies'
           GM's name. It connects on the speaker.

          Yes, you do.

          Runs hot and cold, Billy. Impossible to
          know what we're going to get. He's a crap
          shoot. He's exactly the kind of player
          we're not looking for.

          I'm not picking your pocket, you're
          picking mine. Giambi's name alone is
          worth more than Mabry.

          You realize -

           I do. His career is stagnant, to put it
           nicely. Can we say it's done in theory
           and start drawing up paperwork?

           WADE V/O
           Okay. But -

                          BILLY
           Great.

                         
          He hangs up.

                         

                          PETER
           I think he was going to say something
           else.

                          BILLY
           Peter. Rule Number 3: When you get the
           answer you're looking for - hang up.
           That's done, and in a minute Pena's going
           to Detroit.

                         

                          PETER
           I don't think you want to do that.

                          BILLY
           Art can't put him at first if he's
           playing for the Tigers and I want Hatte
           in the lineup tonight.

                         

                          PETER
           Maybe you should think about this.
           You're upset and this is - this -

                          BILLY
           What am I missing?

                         

                          PETER
           It's just a very hard move to explain.
           People are going to think you've lost
           your mind.

           David, Peña's going on the blocks,
           you're my first call... because he's
           making the rest of the team look bad...
           He's going to be rookie of the year...

                         

                          PETER
           (not eager to help
           but...)
           Probably an all star.

                          BILLY
           He's an all star Dave...
           (winks at Peter,

                          LISTENS)
           It's more like he's creating self-esteem
           problems for the other guys... No, I'm
           looking for a reliever and some cash...
           Ok... five minutes Dave, I'm not waiting.

                          (HANGS UP)
           What's the problem?

                          PETER
           (trying to slow it

                          DOWN)
           Billy, Peña is an all star. If you dump
           him, and if Hatte doesn't work out, you
           know, this is the kind of decision that
           gets you fired.

                          BILLY
           Why you worrying about my job?

                          (BEAT)
           You worried about my job or yours?

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
           I'm worried about yours.

                         

                          BILLY
           Well you should be worrying about yours
           because if this thing we're doing don't
           work... neither of us have jobs.

                          PETER
           That's probably true.

                          BILLY
           In which case I'm a 44 year old guy with
           a high-school diploma and a daughter who
           I'd like to be able to put through
           college one day.
           (lets it sink in)
           You're 25 years old with a degree from
           Yale and a pretty impressive
           apprenticeship.

                          (BEAT)
           I don't think we're asking the right
           question. I think the question we're
           supposed to be asking now is, do you
           believe in what we're doing or not?

                          (BEAT)
           It's a problem that you think we need to
           explain ourselves. Don't... to anyone.
           I'm going to see this through, for better
           or for worse. Just tell me, do you
           project we'll win more games with Peña or
           Hatteberg on first?

                         

                          PETER
           It's close Billy but theoretically
           Hatteberg.

                          BILLY
           What are we talking about then?

                         
          The phone rings.

                          BILLY
           Dave.

                          (LISTENS)
           That works. Great. There's just one more
           thing I need. I don't want the guys
           paying for soda--I want you to stock my
           soda machine for three years. Uh huh, uh
           huh, great... then that's a deal.
          Billy hangs up. He stares at Peter.

                         

                          PETER
           That was thoughtful.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah. Okay. You gotta tell Pena to pack.

                         

                          PETER
           You want me to tell Pena he's been
           traded?

                         

                          BILLY
           Be a man.

           101.

           101.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           What about Jeremy? Am I telling him,
           too.

                         

                          BILLY
           No. I'll do that.

                         

          B99 INT. LOCKER ROOM B99

           Peter walks into the locker room. Sees Pena talking to a
           couple of other players. He approaches Pena.

                          PETER
           Hey, Carlos.

                         

                          PENA
           Yeah.

                          PETER
           Can I get a moment with you?

                         

                          PENA
           Sure.

                         

                          PETER
           Okay, maybe we can talk over here.

                         
           They walk awkwardly to the players' lounge.

                          PETER
           Have a seat.
           They sit.

                         

                          PETER
           So, um, Carlos, you've been traded to the
           Tigers. This is the number of Jay Palmer,
           their travel secretary. He's expecting
           your call. He'll help you arrange travel
           to Detroit.

                         
           Pena sits and stares at him. It's excruciating for Peter,
           awkward, until --

                         

                          PENA
           Is that all?

                          PETER
           Yeah.

                          PENA
           Cool.

                         
           Pena just takes it. Picks up the number and leaves.

           102.

           102.

                         

                         

          99 INT. ART'S OFFICE - LATER - DAY 99


                         
           Billy knocks and lets himself in.

                         

                          BILLY
           Mind if I have a seat.

                          ART
           Please.

                          BILLY
           You can't start Pena at first tonight,
           you'll have to start Hatteberg.

                         

                          ART
           I don't want to go 15 rounds, Billy, the
           line-up card is mine and that's all.

                          BILLY
           The line-up card is definitely yours, I'm
           just saying you can't start Pena at
           first.

                         

                          ART
           I am starting Pena at first.

                          BILLY
           I don't think so, he plays for the
           Detroit Tigers now.

                         

                          ART

                          (PAUSE)
           You traded Pena?!

                         

                          BILLY
           Along with German, Hiljus and Jeremy
           Giambi.

                         

                          ART
           You are outside your fucking mind.

                         
           Art stares at him in a silence broken by Jeremy Giambi
           knocking on the open door.

                         

                          BILLY
           Jeremy, come on in.

                         
           Billy jots a phone number on an A's Post-It and hands it
           to him.

                         

                          BILLY
           This is Ed Wade's number. You know him?

                         
           Art looks sick.

           103.

           103.

                         

                         

                          JEREMY
           No.

                         

                          BILLY
           Phillies General Manager. Real nice guy.
           Give him a call - he's expecting it - say
           hello - then talk to Futterman about
           arranging a flight for you.

                          JEREMY
           The what?

                         

                          BILLY
           The flight. To Philadelphia.
          Billy gets up and shakes his hand.

                         

                          BILLY
           It's been a real pleasure, Jeremy. I
           mean that. You're a great ballplayer and
           great guy.

                         
          Jeremy, not sure he heard right, looks at the Post-It in
          his hand as Billy escorts him to the door.

                         

                          BILLY
           We're going to miss you.

                         
          Jeremy leaves. Billy looks at Art from the door.

                          BILLY
           Adkins is gone, too.

                         

                          ART
           You're killing this team.

                          BILLY
           Art? I can do this all day long.

                         
          He leaves. Art notices Peter, who had been lurking by the
          door, eavesdropping.

                         

                          ART
           What are you looking at?

                         

                          PETER
           I'm not looking at anything.

                          ART
           You went along with this? You agree with
           this bullshit?

                         

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
           A hundred percent.

          A100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY A100


                         
           Pena cleans out his locker. Several players stop by to
           say goodbye. Tejada --

                         

                          TEJADA
           Keep your head up, okay? It's part of
           the business. You're gonna be a great
           player, okay?

                          PENA
           Thank you, man.

                         

                          TEJADA
           Don't let this bother you at all.

                         
           Chad Bradford --

                          CHAD
           Nice to meet you, brother. Take care
           and... God bless you, man.

                         

                          PENA
           Thank you.

                         
           Scott Hatteberg --

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           You're the best first baseman here. It's
           not right, Carlos.

                         

                          PENA
           Thank you, Hattie.

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           Yeah.

          100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100


                         
           BILLY and PETER stride through as the team is getting
           dressed for batting practice.
           The place quiets down as BILLY comes in. They've all
           heard the news and they've never experienced a move like
           this in their careers.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Scottie H.!

                          SCOTT
           Yes sir.

                         

                          BILLY
           Go out and field some grounders.

           105.

           105.

                         

                         
           BILLY looks around at the PLAYERS, who are looking at
           Billy...

                         

                          BILLY
           Everybody, listen up. You may not look
           like a winning ball team. In fact, you
           look nothing like a winning ball team.
           But you are one. So play like one
           tonight. You'll get further instructions
           tomorrow.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          101 EXT. THE FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 101

           DAVID JUSTICE hits a single up the middle as the runners
           on 2nd and 3rd round the bases to score.

                         

          102 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - SAME TIME 102

          A103 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT A103

           Billy talks to Chavez and Ellis. Peter stands nearby.

                         

                          BILLY
           No more bunts.

                         

                          CHAVEZ
           No more bunts?

                          BILLY
           A bunt is an out. You're paid to avoid
           outs, not make them.

                         

                          CHAVEZ
           A bunt isn't an out. It's a sacrifice.

                          BILLY
           A bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters.
           You're not a pitcher, Chavvie, so what
           are you saying?

                          (THEN)
           Until the third out, anything can happen.
           After the third out, it's over. You
           gotta protect your outs like they're your
           children. Every out's precious, don't
           give `em away.

                          (THEN)

           Another thing -- you should see more
           pitches. We wanna get into their
           bullpen. Deep into their bullpen. We
           want to see 100 pitches by the end of the
           5th inning. You wanna get your at-bats
           off their 10th and 11th pitcher.

                         

                          ELLIS
           You want us to walk more. How much more?

                         

                          BILLY
           Pete?

                         

                          PETER
           At least once every ten at bats.

                          ELLIS
           Or...?

                          BILLY
           Triple-A Sacramento's only 80 miles away.
           And there's no flights.
           (as they look to

                          PETER)
           Don't look at him. Here's the deal. I'm
           not interested in what you think you know
           about baseball, or what you think I don't
           know about it. I'm not interested in
           guts or heart or determination or
           anything else the fans or your mothers
           love about you. I'm interested in you
           getting on base. If you do that, we win.
           If you don't, we lose. And I hate to
           lose. I hate to lose more than I need to
           win. There's a difference.

                         

          B103 INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY B103

           Billy and Peter give advice to Dye and Byrnes.

                          PETER
           Every at bat is like a hand of blackjack.
           Every card that's dealt, your odds
           completely change. For instance, every
           first pitch strike, your batting average
           goes down about 75 points.

           75 points.

                          PETER
           75 points. Every first pitch ball, it
           goes up about the same amount. So you
           gotta lay off the first pitch.

           the first pitch you're batting .140.

                         

                          BILLY
           We want to see more pitches.

           How many pitches?

                         

                          PETER
           Every starter, we want to see 100 pitches
           by the 5th inning.

                          DYE
           So... 5, 6 pitches per at bat?

                         

                          PETER
           Yeah. I mean, Hatteberg drained 38
           pitches.

                         

                          BILLY
           And Byrnsie, you're hackin' at
           everything. You're all squirrely out
           there. Wait for your pitch, man. This
           is a war of attrition. There's no clock
           on this thing. Wait `em out. Let them
           make the mistakes. And when your enemy's
           making mistakes -- don't interrupt them.

           Peter advises Durham as he works out.

                          PETER
           Basically, these are all your at bats.
           This is you versus righties, you versus
           lefties... and then, of course, all your
           count knowledge, okay? In an 0-0 count
           you're batting .290. In an 0-1 you
           average .238. In a 0-2, .159. When
           you're 1-0, you're batting .324.
           Understand what I'm saying?

                          DURHAM
           Not really.

                         

                          PETER
           I know, it's a lot of math. When your
           first pitch is a strike, your batting
           average goes down about 70 points.

                          PETER (CONT'D)
           When it's a ball, it goes up about 30.
           If you draw a ball on your first pitch,
           you're unstoppable. If you strike on the
           first pitch, you might as well be jumping
           off cliff. I'm trying to get you to lay
           off the first pitch.

                         

                          DURHAM
           But I'm a first pitch hitter. I like to
           swing at fastballs.

                         

                          PETER
           And that's the way you've been trained.
           But it's a habit we'd like to break you
           from. We're trying to design the game to
           your strengths. This has nothing to do
           with you being a great hitter -- you're a
           great hitter. We just want to get you on
           base.

                         

                          DURHAM
           But if I get my pitch, I'm gonna swing at
           it, no matter what the count is.

                         

                          PETER
           I'm not worried about you crushing the
           ball out of the park. I just want you to
           lay off anything that will result in a
           strike.

                          DURHAM
           I guess I'll have to watch some film and
           take a look at it.

                         

                          PETER
           Absolutely. The video room is open to
           you any time, I'm always available.

           to do.

                          BILLY
           No, I pay you to get on first, not get
           thrown out at second.

           You've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17
           tries this season.

                         

                          LONG
           I get 11 of 17. That's not bad.

           You just handed them an out. Protect
           your outs like they're your children.
           There's no clock on this game. Until the
           third out, anything can happen. Get on

                          BILLY
           You've never seen a GM who was a player.

           Huh.

                          BILLY

           It's okay, man. I know your routine. It's
           a patter, it's rap, it's for effect.
           That's okay. But it's for them, it's not
           for me.

                         

                          BILLY

                          BILLY
           As a matter of fact I'm not paying you 7
           million bucks, David. The Yankees are
           paying half your salary. That's what the

           You're almost 37, Dave. Almost as old as
           me. Let's be honest with each other
           about what we each want. I want to milk
           the last ounce of baseball you have left
           in you, and you want to stay in the show.
           So let's do that. I'm not paying you to
           be the player you used to be, I'm paying
           you to be the player you are now. You're
           smart, you know what's going on here. I
           need you to set an example for the
           younger guys. Take a leadership role.

           columns of numbers, upon which Billy darts his eyes as he
           scrolls through them. Finally -

                         

                          BILLY
           Okay.

                         
           He gets up and heads out.

                         

          A112 INT. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON A112


                         
           BILLY walks through the clubhouse, shouting locker room
           shoutouts to PLAYERS as he walks by.

                          BILLY
           Voos.

                         

                          VOOS
           Billy.

                          BILLY
           (pointing back down

                          HALL)
           That smell is getting worse.

                          VOOS
           I'm on it, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (TO HERNANDEZ)
           What are we doing tonight?

                          HERNANDEZ
           Splitting the plate in half.

                          BILLY
           Both sides.
           (to Hudson, playing

                          CARDS)
           Huddy, you gotta mix it up tonight.
           Trust your slider.

           114.

           114.

                         

                         

                          HUDSON
           Yes sir.

                         

                          BILLY
           (to the others)
           You guys stop distracting him.

                          (TO CHAVEZ)
           Chavvie -- you couldn't hit that shit
           with a boat paddle last night. You gotta
           see more pitches. Patience.

                         

                          CHAVEZ
           You got it, Billy.

                         
           As Billy crosses through the weight room --

                          BILLY

                          (TO JUSTICE)
           Hey David --

                         

                          JUSTICE
           Hey, man.

                         

                          BILLY
           Great at bats. Really. Quality.

                          JUSTICE
           Thank you.

          112 INT. ART'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 112


                         
           BILLY knocks on Art's door -- something we haven't seen
           him do before.
           ART can see BILLY through the window blinds and is a
           little surprised at the courtesy of a knock.

                         

                          ART
           Come in.
           BILLY does. He's going to try to do this nicely.

                         

                          BILLY
           How are ya?

                         

                          ART
           Good. You knocked.

                         

                          BILLY
           I did, and I hope you take it as a show
           of respect.

                         

                          ART
           We'll see.

           115.

           115.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
          You look good.

                         

                          ART
          We've won 7 in a row, what am I doing
          wrong now?

                         

                          BILLY
          Absolutely nothing.

                         

                          ART
          Good.

                         

                          BILLY
          But.

                          ART
          Yeah.

                          BILLY
          Magnante's having some head problems.

                         

                          ART
          Head problems.

                         

                          BILLY
          Yeah.

                         

                          ART
          Okay.

                          BILLY
          He's 37 and he's got three blown saves in
          two weeks. Everytime he winds up he's
          thinking he's about to throw the last
          pitch of his life. So he grips it a
          little hard.

                         

                          ART
          I appreciate this.

                          BILLY
          Sure.

                         

                          ART
          But I know my bullpen.

                          BILLY
          Yes you do. Yes you absolutely do. No
          question about it. Except not really.

                         

                          ART
          Yeah?

           116.

           116.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           If we have a lead late in the game and
           they have runners on base, I'd rather not
           see Magnante out of the bullpen.

                          ART
           I'll make that decision when the time
           comes.

                          BILLY
           That's what you should do. Baseball's a
           game of situations and you should make
           the decision when the time comes. Except
           you should make it now.

                          ART

                          LOOK--

                          BILLY
           Don't bring Magnante out if we've gotta
           hold a late lead with runners on. He's
           37, he's scared shitless of being the guy
           who blows this winning streak.

                         

                          ART
           You think a lot of yourself, don't you?

                          BILLY
           I......think the regular amount of
           myself. Magnante on the other hand, he
           doesn't think very much of himself at
           all, and when he tightens up we've got
           ourselves an adventure. So I'd like to
           see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight
           when we're in, let's say, just to make it
           easier for you, any situation.
           Righty/lefty, two outs, no outs, the
           umpires have decided we're going to
           finish the game by playing darts,
           whatever. Bradford's the first guy out of
           the pen.

                          (BEAT)
           Okay?

                         
          ART regards BILLY for a moment...

                         

                          ART
           I could've coached you up, you know.

                          BILLY
           I don't think so.

                         

                          ART
           You think you went as far as you could
           have?

           117.

           117.

                         

                         

                          BILLY

                          (PAUSE)
           Yeah, that's what I meant. Play Bradford.

                         
           BILLY steps out of Art's office into--

                         

          113 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATER - NIGHT 113

           The game plays on TV as BILLY bench presses. The A's are
           up by three runs in the ninth inning but the Indians have
           a runner on first.

                         
           Through the tunnel, BILLY can hear the crack of the bat
           and a collective groan from the stands.

                         
           BILLY holds the barbell in the air--frozen--as he simply
           looks at the T.V. and sees the silent images.

                         

          114 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 114

           ART HOWE walking to the mound, tapping his left hand.

                         
           MAGNANTE heading to the mound.

          115 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 115


                         
           We think BILLY's going to trash the weights, but he
           simply returns the barbell to the bracket, sits up and
           watches the silent images.

                         

          116 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 116


                         
           MAGNANTE mops his brow, squints for the sign, winds up
           and makes his pitch. It misses low for ball four and
           PEDRO walks to first.

                         

          117 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 117

           Billy lays back on the bench, breathes, then unmutes the
           T.V. and we hear -

           ANNOUNCER (FROM TV)
           Magnante has quickly let two on base for
           Lee Stevens who's the go ahead run for
           the Indians in a game that Oakland
           appeared to have put away.
           And then - BILLY sits calmly...waits for it...and--

           CRACK!

                         
           --BILLY nods his head at the inevitable.

           118.

           118.

                         

                         

           ANNOUNCER (FROM TV)
           That ball is deep....way back...three run
           homer for Lee Stevens to put Cleveland
           ahead in the ninth inning...
           BILLY can hear 40,000 people booing their lungs out. He
           takes a moment, then grabs his jacket.

                         

          118 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 118

           The FANS are booing as ART makes his way to the mound to
           take MAGNANTE out. BRADFORD makes his way from the
           bullpen and takes the ball from ART.
           ART turns to head back to the dugout but slows as he sees
           a strange sight: BILLY is standing at the dugout rail.

                         
           The plate UMPIRE notices and follows Art's line of sight.
           He sees BILLY and walks over there ahead of Art.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           You can't be in there, Billy.

                         
           BILLY doesn't move. He just watches ART as he comes into
           the dugout.

                          UMPIRE
           Billy?

                         
           The PLAYERS are watching to see what's going to happen.
           BILLY puts his hand on ART's shoulder a second as he says-

                          -

                         

                          BILLY
           Just nod a little bit--not too much--like
           I'm assuring you you didn't just make a
           calamitous vocational decision.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           Players and coaches only, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           (ignoring the umpire--
           still quietly to

                          ART)
           Remember that in about four seconds--
           BILLY sees one of the nearby TV cameras pivot over to
           catch this conversation--

                          BILLY
           --yeah there it is. We're the lead story
           on Sports Center now so let me be brief.
           First of all, that was an awfully costly
           fuck-you, wouldn't you say?

           119.

           119.

                         

                         

                          ART

                          LOOK--

                         

                          BILLY
           Second of all, genius, those boos?
           They're for you. Drink up.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           Come on, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           Get me this game back.

                         
           As BILLY passes MAGNANTE he pats his back before we--

                          CUT TO:

                         

          119 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - NIGHT 119

           The radio is on and the ANNOUNCER is telling us--

                         

           ANNOUNCER (FROM RADIO)
           ...after giving up the lead on a three
           run homer off Magnante, the A's came
           right back to win it in the bottom of the
           ninth with another three run homer by
           Miguel Tejada. And the A's have won eight
           in a row!

           street clothes. The team's equipment manager, pouring
           himself a cup of coffee, glances over -

                         

                          VOOS
           You want one, Billy?

           I'm good, Voos. Thanks.

           120.

           120.

                         

                         
           Voos wanders off. Billy keeps looking at the players ...

                         
           LEGEND: July 31 - TRADE DEADLINE

                         

          E120 INT. SCOUTS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY E120


                         
           Billy comes in sticking some tobacco under his lip and,
           like a shark that knows it could die if it stops moving,
           doesn't through the entire scene --

                          BILLY
           Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.

                         

                          PETER
           Are you thinking Rincon?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah, he's lost faith for the season. I
           think he's gonna dump him.

                         

                          PETER
           Hardcore.

                         
           They wait as Suzanne dials the Indians' GM, staring at
           the speakerphone that sits like a little island in the
           middle of the conference table.

                         

                          SUZANNE
           Shapiro on two.

                         

                          BILLY
           Mark. Billy. Let's be honest. A
           premiere setup man is not going to get
           you any closer to the playoffs.

                         

           SHAPIRO V/O
           Are you referring to Rincon?

                         

                          BILLY
           He's a luxury you can't afford.

           SHAPIRO V/O
           And you can? There's half a million on
           his contract and at least one other
           suitor.

                          BILLY
           By at least one, you mean one? Who is
           it?

                         

           SHAPIRO V/O
           I'd rather not say.

           121.

           121.

                          (WHISPERS)
           San Francisco.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'll call you back.

                         
          He hangs up. Stares down Peter.

                          PETER
           What do you think we can get for
           Magnante?

                         

                          BILLY
           Nothing.
           (continues to stare

                          DOWN PETER)
           What's left on Venafro's contract?

                          PETER
           Two-seventy-five.

                         

                          BILLY
           Suzanne -- get me Sabean.

                          (THEN)
           If we can get San Francisco interested in
           Venafro, Shapiro's only got one buyer for
           Rincon.

                         

                          PETER
           Us.

                         
          Pete gets busy on his computer.

                         

                          SUZANNE
           On three.

                         

                          BILLY
           Sabes. Billy. You like Venafro. I can
           let you have him for almost nothing.

           SABEAN V/O
           (smelling a rat)
           Why would you do that, Billy?

                         

                          BILLY
           Because I'm amazing.

                         

           SABEAN V/O
           Uh-huh.

                         

                          BILLY
           All I want is a couple of bucks and a
           sweetener. Throw in, say...

           122.

           122.

                         

                         
          Billy snaps his fingers at Peter --

                         

                          PETER
           Anderson.

                          BILLY
           Anderson.

                         

           SABEAN V/O
           I like Anderson.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, you don't. I don't even like him. I
           don't know why I'm doing this -- but let's
           do it anyway. Venafro for Michaelson?

                          PETER
           Anderson.

                          BILLY
           Anderson. See, I don't even know his
           name.

                         

           SABEAN V/O
           I'll think (about) --

                          BILLY
           Think about it and call me back.

                         
          He hangs up.

                          BILLY
           Get Shapiro back on.

                         
          Billy and Pete stare at each other in silence.

                          SUZANNE
           Two!

                         

                          BILLY

                          MARK --

                         

           SHAPIRO V/O
           You can't afford him, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           You sure about that? I get the
           impression the market for Rincon is
           softening. I could be wrong. Call
           whoever's interested and make sure
           they're still interested. And call me
           back.

                         
          He hangs up.

           123.

           123.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           What about the Mets for Venafro?

                         

                          PETER
           You just offered him to the Giants.

                          BILLY
           Suzanne -- Steve Phillips! Get me Steve
           Phillips.

                         
          Pete works his computer.

                         

                          BILLY
           Between Bonds, Nen, Kent and Snow,
           they're never gonna do it.

                          PETER
           Totally agree.

                          BILLY
           We just need them to cool on Rincon.

                         

                          SUZANNE
           Phillips on two.

                         

                          BILLY
           Steve-O. Billy. I hear you're looking
           for a left-handed reliever. What do you
           think of Venafro? I can make it quick
           and easy for you.

           PHILLIPS V/O
           What's the angle?

                         

                          BILLY
           No angle.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           Who am I getting fleeced for?

                          BILLY
           Hang on a second.

                         
          He puts him on hold. Peter is already scrolling through
          the Mets' farm system, his eyes darting around the stats.

                          PETER
           Bennett maybe?

                          BILLY
           How old?

                         

                          PETER
           Twenty-six.

           124.

           124.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Twenty-six and in Double-A? Forget it.

                         

                          PETER
           Duncan? No. Cerda? No. Furbush?

                          BILLY
           Furbush?

                          (BEAT)
           No.

                          PETER
           Eckerton? Eckerton. Eckerton, that's
           the guy.
          Billy punches the phone off hold.

                         

                          BILLY
           Eckerton.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           Eckerton? I like Eckerton.

                          BILLY
           You don't even know who Eckerton is.
          The phone on Pete's desk rings. Peter answers a second
          blinking line.

                         

                          PETER
           Hello?

           PHILLIPS V/O
           Is Venafro hurt?

                         

                          PETER
           Oh, hi.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, he's not hurt. He's fine. This is
           just a situation for us.

                          PETER
           It's Steve.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           Last couple of times out, he got
           hammered.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (MUTE)
           I'm on with Steve.

                          (UNMUTE)
           Not his fault. We misused him.

           125.

           125.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           Steve Schott.

                         

                          BILLY
           Tell him to hold.
           (to Steve Phillips)
           Look. Steve. Here's the deal. I'm
           being straight with you. I'm getting
           Rincon. It's a done deal. It's done.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           I heard the Giants --

                         

                          BILLY
           No, the Giants want Venafro. And I told
           them they can have him for Michaelson...

                          PETER

                          ANDERSON --

                         

                          BILLY
           -- but I'd rather deal with you. Because
           you can give me Eckerton and two hundred
           and twenty-five thousand cash and the
           Giants can't.
          Billy's look to Peter says, Doesn't hurt to ask. As they
          listen to silence on Phillips' side of the call --

                         

                          PETER
           Yes, I understand it's impolite to keep
           you holding.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           I'll think about it.

                          BILLY
           Of course. Think. But whoever calls me
           back first gets Venafro.
          He hangs up. Looks for the blinking light that belongs
          to his owner.

                         

                          PETER
           He hung up.

                         
          Silence. Then --

                          BILLY
           If you could have the power of flight or
           invisibility, which would you choose?

                         

                          PETER
           What?

           126.

           126.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Invisibility or flight?

                         

                          PETER

                          (THINKS)
           Invisibility.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's what Casey said. Why?

                         

                          PETER
           You'd have total access. Besides,
           everyone else would choose flight.

                         
          Quiet.

                          BILLY
           Why isn't anybody calling?
          The phone rings.

                         

                          SUZANNE
           Shapiro's on two.

                         
          Billy picks up. Listens. Fist pump.

                          BILLY
           Great. Lemme talk to my owner. Call you
           right back.

                          (THEN)
           Get Steve.

                         

                          PETER
           Phillips or Schott?

                          BILLY
           Why would I call Phillips back? Schott.
           Tell him I'm on the other line.

                         

                          PETER
           Right.

                         
          Peter dials. Billy can't sit.

                         

                          PETER
           Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. Sorry I
           left you on hold. Billy asked me to call
           you back. He's on another line.

                          BILLY
           Tell him we need two hundred and twenty-
           five grand for Rincon.

           127.

           127.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           Billy says he needs two hundred and
           twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo
           Rincon. Please?

                          (THEN)
           Yes, I added the please.
           (listens; to Billy)
           No.
          Billy thinks intensely. Finally --

                         

                          BILLY
           Tell him I'll pay it, but when I sell him
           next year for twice that, I keep the
           money.

                          PETER
           Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself,
           sell him next year, and keep the profit.

                         
          Peter listens to whatever Steve Schott is saying, then --

                         

                          PETER
           Okay. Thank you.

                          (HANGS UP)
           He says he'll pay for Rincon.
          High five.

                         

                          BILLY
           Great! Shit. What are we forgetting?

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Get me Shapiro!

                         
          -- as he grabs his cell phone and hits speed dial.

                          BILLY
           Wait, never mind!
           (beat, then into

                          PHONE)
           Mark. Yeah, it's Billy. Here's the
           deal. I don't want Rincon pitching
           against me tonight. Tell him to change
           his clothes. I got you the money and I
           accept your gratitude. It's done.
          He hangs up. Fist bump.

                         

                          BILLY
           We gotta let someone go. It's Mags.
           It's gotta be Mags.

                         

                          PETER
           I call not it.

           128.

           128.

                         

                         
           Billy dials an extension.

                         

                          BILLY
           Art. Billy. The good news is Ricardo
           Rincon's heading over to the clubhouse.
           The bad news is you got to tell Mags he
           threw his last pitch for the Oakland A's
           last night.

           ART V/O
           No.

                         

                          BILLY
           What do you mean, no.

           ART V/O
           No, as in no. I'm not doing it. You do
           it. You did it, so you do it.
           Art hangs up. Billy slams the speakerphone.

                         

                          PETER
           It's not the phone's fault. Suzanne,
           we're gonna need a new speakerphone.

                         

                          BILLY
           We gotta catch Mags before Rincon comes
           over.

                         
           He leaves.

           Billy comes through the clubhouse past his team suiting
           up to where Magnante is adjusting his knee braces next to
           his locker, and sits with him.

                          BILLY

                          MIKE --

                          MAGNANTE
           Hey, Billy. I know I've been struggling
           lately. But we're coming into the home
           stretch, and I promise I'm gonna turn it

                          AROUND --

                         

                          BILLY
           -- I need you to stop getting dressed.
           Magnante isn't sure he heard right, but the silence tells
           him he did. Eventually -

                         

                          MAGNANTE
           Traded?

           129.

           129.

                         

                         
          Billy shakes his head, no.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm sorry for the crap news. I know it
           hurts.

                          (THEN)
           Mike. I can't have 26 guys in the
           clubhouse.
          Magnante nods.

                         

                          MAGNANTE
           Alright.

                         

                          BILLY
           Thanks.
          Billy gets up to leave. As he exits, he sees Peter enter
          with Rincon, standing with his new uniform in his arms,
          looking like a prison inmate. Oops. Billy joins them.

                          BILLY
           Hey, Ricardo.

                         

                          RINCON
           Hola, senor.

                          BILLY
           Hola. Hey, I know this must seem a bit
           sudden, but the Oakland A's have been
           trying to get you for a long time.
           You're gonna love it here. The guys are
           fun.

                          PETER
           Muy divertido.

                          RINCON
           I pitch tonight?

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't know if you're gonna pitch
           tonight. But you're on our team tonight.

                          RINCON
           I no wanna pitch tonight.

                         

                          BILLY
           Right. So... where you from?

                         

                          RINCON
           Veracruz, Mexico.

                          BILLY
           Well, you're a lot closer to home. Why
           don't you hang out there for five menudos
           and we'll get you a uniform and
           everything.
           (to side room)
           Hey guys, clear the room, huh? Say hi to
           Ricardo Rincon.

           Tara and me were thinking --

                         

                          CASEY
           Dad... Tara and I --

                          TARA
           She is correct.

                         

                          BILLY
           Tara and I were thinking about going to
           Point Reyes to the beach.

                          CASEY
           That'd be fun.

                         

                          TARA
           Me go, too?

                          BILLY
           And I'll work on my grammar.

                         

                          CASEY
           (beat, then)
           Dad... are you going to lose your job?

                         

                          BILLY
           What? Where did you hear that, honey?

                         

                          CASEY
           The internet.

                          BILLY
           No, I'm not going to lose my job. Don't
           go on the internet or watch TV or read
           the papers or talk to people.

           131.

           131.

                         

                         

                          CASEY
          I'm not talking to people, I'm just
          reading stuff.

                         

                          BILLY
          Don't worry. You don't believe me? Ask
          Tara.

                         

                          TARA
          He's not (losing his job). Your dad is a
          brilliant man. He's the best GM in
          baseball.

                         

                          CASEY
          But say that you did -- just saying --
          would you have to move away?

                         

                          BILLY
          No, honey. Absolutely not. And even if
          I did, I'm not going anywhere. I told
          you not to worry about me. People say a
          lot of crazy things and they don't always
          know what they're talking about. It's
          just gossip. Like gossipers at school.

                         

                          TARA
          You can't always believe what you read.
          Sometimes you need to scratch underneath
          the surface and find who the authority
          is.

                          BILLY
          And once you do find out who the
          authorities are, ignore them at all
          costs.

                          TARA
          You can always ask your dad.

                         

                          BILLY
          Everything's fine, honey. I'm not going
          anywhere. The only way I would lose my
          job is if someone was to give me a better
          one. Don't worry about me, okay? Dad
          knows what he's doing.

                          CASEY
          Pinkie swear?

           Peter sits with Hatteberg, reviewing his hits on a
           monitor.

                         

                          PETER
           This is a chart of what you should and
           shouldn't be swinging at. These circles
           represent different pitches. Red is hit,
           blue is out, yellow's missed or foul,
           green is chased, white taken. This is
           you versus Conway. What do you see?

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           I'm chasing a lot of high and outside.

                         

                          PETER
           The red is where most hits happen.
           That's where you want to be swinging.
           You don't want to be swinging at the junk
           at the top of the strike zone. We'd
           rather take those strikes, `cause you're
           not going to hit `em out of the park.
           And you're good about that, patient.

                          PETER (CONT'D)
           Right now you're averaging about 4
           pitches per at-bat.

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           4 per bat?

                          PETER
           Yeah, and that's great. One of the
           reasons why we love you. You're draining
           a pitcher's pitches. Now, guys like
           Bonds and Jason Giambi average a little
           over 5. That's top tier. Does this
           chart make sense to you?

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           Yeah. I'll get on base more if I lay off
           anything high. This is awesome. So you
           have a breakdown of this from every game?

                          PETER
           Every game. Your instincts are in the
           right place. This isn't something they
           teach you in little league. This is
           something fundamental we're looking for --
           how to wear out a pitcher's arm. If
           you're about to face Conway and wondering
           what you should and shouldn't swing at,
           come in here and watch how you're

           back and forth.

                          PETER
           Everybody thinks the first pitch is
           what's most important, but it's not.
           It's the first two out of three pitches
           that matter the most.

           The difference between 1-2 and 2-1 is the
           difference between a scrub and an All
           Star.

                         

                          BILLY
           So you're saying if we can get our guys
           to lay off the first pitch it'll put us
           in the driver's seat?

                          PETER
           Any sort of extra discipline in the first
           three pitches will help us.

           I can't understand you with your hand

           Hey, Scottie. What's on your mind?

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           I feel like I'm hurting the team. At
           first base I'm making a lot of errors.
           I'm gonna cost us a hundred runs.

                          BILLY
           16.5 actually. But as a hitter, you will
           create 70 runs. 70 runs wins us an awful
           lot of ball games. I can live with that.
           Can you live with that?

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           I appreciate that, but I know you're just
           pulling those numbers out of your ass.

                          BILLY
           I'm pulling them out of Pete's, actually.

           REPORTER #1 V/O
           Well you said it not me.
           Tickets are torn and purses searched as record breaking
           numbers of fans pour into the stadium.

           REPORTER #2 V/O
           None of the Oakland fans in their cars
           down there have forgotten the A's
           inglorious history-making choke in Game 5
           of the ALDS last October and tonight--

          139 INT. A'S LOCKER ROOM - DAY 139


                         
           It's like a tomb. The PLAYERS are getting ready without
           music or chat. Justice steps up to deliver a pre-game
           pep talk.

                          JUSTICE
           Hey, listen up fellas... bring it up real
           quick.

                          (THEN)
           We got some older guys on this team, we
           got some younger guys on this team. What
           we got right now is a chance for everyone
           to make history. I don't want to get
           sappy and corny, but this is what we play
           for. We've been playin' real good for
           19. Let's get 20. We get 20, they can't
           take that away from us until they do it
           themselves. Guys that are starting
           tonight, keep playing like you've been
           playing. Guys not starting, be ready.
           Huddie, you got the ball -- shove it up
           their ass tonight. Let's play some ball!
           Let's go!

           REPORTER #2 V/O
           --one game shy of 20 consecutive wins,
           they have a shot at redemption. How rare
           is it to win 20 games in a row? This
           rare: No American League team has ever
           done it.

           BILLY heads east on 580. His cell phone rings and he hits
           the speaker button for the truck.

                         

                          BILLY
           Don't tell me the score, Peter.

           SHARON V/O
           It's me, Billy.

                          BILLY
           How you doin', leggy.

                         

           SHARON V/O
           Nope.

                         

                          BILLY
           Sharon?

                         

           SHARON V/O
           You hangin' in there?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         
           There's silence...

                         

                          BILLY
           Hello?

                          (BEAT)
           Sharon?

           SHARON V/O

                          (PAUSE)
           "Go into real estate". What a stupid
           thing to say.
           BILLY didn't even realize until that moment how much he
           wanted to hear her say that...He's not sure what to say
           back.

                         

                          BILLY
           I appreciate that, thanks.

                         

           SHARON V/O
           Good luck. Casey wants to talk to you.

                         

           CASEY V/O
           Are you on your way to the stadium?

                         

                          BILLY
           No, I'm on my way to Visalia to see our
           minor league team.

           142.

           142.

                         

                         

                          CASEY
           Dad - turn around. You have to see the
           game.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, I don't.

                          CASEY
           Turn around.

                          BILLY
           I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. I
           love you.

                         
           He hangs up, drives a little longer...letting what Casey
           said sink in. Then...

                          BILLY

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Shhhit.

                         
           ...he turns on the radio.

           ANNOUNCER V/O
           Tim Hudson is carving through this Royals
           line-up and at the end of three, it's the
           A's 11 and Kansas City nothing.

                          BILLY

                          (QUIETLY)
           Oh God.

                          (BEAT)
           Ohhhh God.

                         
           BILLY sees the sign for the next exit coming up. He makes
           a decision and quickly crosses to the right, just making
           the exit.

           BILLY is striding through an underground corridor which
           is echoing with the cheers of 55,000 fans.

                         

          142 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD LEVEL - DAY 142

           BILLY emerges from a tunnel to a sight Billy's denied
           himself for 138 games: The lit-up ballpark with a game in
           play. From the field, we see Billy finding his place in
           the seats behind home plate. Peter is already there.

           143.

           143.

                         

                         
           BILLY'S POV OF THE SCOREBOARD: 11-0 at the bottom of the
           3rd. Unfortunately the idyllic moment is short-lived as
           Dye strikes out swinging and the teams swap places. The
           A's take the field with TIM HUDSON pitching.
           Billy looks around. He sees the scoreboard, a FAN with a
           big funky cowboy hat, the charged-up crowd in the stands,
           it's like the Coliseum at Rome.

           IBANEZ of the Royals singles to center field.

                         
           RANDA of the Royals singles to left field.
           But the Oakland fans are still jubilant and do the wave.

                         
           Then a big error from Tejada puts runners on 1st, 2nd and
           3rd (MAYNE, Ibanez and Randa).

           As if we've entered the Twilight Zone, it becomes
           twilight and LIGHTS GO ON.

                         
           DEE BROWN of the Royals singles to right, bringing Ibanez
           and Randa home, and Mayne to 3rd.

                         
           Ibanez and Randa high-five each other at the plate,
           passing Billy as they head to their dugout. Okay, the
           Royals are on the board now: 11-2, but just barely. Until-

           PEREZ of the Royals singles to center field, bringing
           Mayne home.
           Then TUCKER of the Royals doubles to left field. Justice
           makes an embarrassing fall trying to catch it, and Brown
           and Perez score. They high-five and pass Billy as they
           leave the plate, the second time he's seen that, and
           suddenly the Royals have 5.
           Reaction shot CLOSE-UPS: Justice, Tejada, Tucker on 2nd,
           Art Howe, the Royals' dugout, a pitcher's conference with
           Peterson and Hudson.

                         
           And finally Billy, who WALKS OUT.

           MIKE SWEENEY of the Royals singles to left-center field --
           Neither Justice or Long get it, it lands between them.
           And they have WORDS.

           144.

           144.

                         

                         
           Randa makes a sloppy single to left field... this one
           goes between Justice and Tejada.

           MONTAGE of A's at bat: Hernandez grounds out, DURHAM
           strikes out, Mabry grounds out... A stunned A'S FAN
           stands up with his arms out in a "WTF??" gesture. While
           the A's are still up, this is excruciating for the fans.

           Kansas City's scored five and Oakland's
           lead is down to six as Art Howe comes out
           to the mound to pull Tim Hudson.

                         
           Art Howe comes out of the dugout, gives the signal for
           "underhander," takes the ball from Hudson.

           ANNOUNCER V/O
           He'll go with the submariner, Chad
           Bradford.

                         
           We see SHOTS OF FANS in the sold-out stadium experiencing
           the height of tension and excitement in sports.

                         
           Chad Bradford comes off the bullpen mound to relieve
           Hudson, and begins counting his steps -

           CHAD walks Mayne. An angry fan throws toilet paper onto
           center field, the one thing Long manages to pick up. The
           crowd grows anxious.
           CHAD's submariner pitch to the next batter, DEE BROWN,
           walks him. BROWN trots down to first and there are now
           two runners on.
           Some FANS have to cover their eyes. There's a pitcher
           conference.

                         
           Art Howe simmers in frustration. He signals Rincon to
           warm up. The fans aren't happy either.

                         
           ORDAZ of the Royals grounds to Tejada, who throws home
           for the force, and misses. Now it's 11-6!

                         
           Howe pulls Bradford.
           Rincon throws a controversial strike out. The Royals
           batter, TUCKER, protests, and fans go crazy BOOING.

                         
           Brown scores, 11-7 now, Royals chipping away that lead,

           Sweeney's up. In rapid succession, we seem him battle off
           TEN PITCHES of Tam. He's got two strikes on him, more
           toilet paper flies on the field, Bowie comes in to warm
           up which Tam sees, then -

           BOWIE is already gone. KOCH is on the mound. There's a
           Royal, PELLOW, on 2nd. According to the scoreboard, it's
           2 outs, 2 strikes. If Koch throws a strike, the game is
           over. The fans are fucking feverish.
           ALICEA of the Royals singles to left and Pellow scores.
           The game is now TIED.

           The scoreboard shows us that it's still tied in the
           bottom of the ninth. Nobody's out. DYE grabs a bat and
           walks to the plate. Then, inexplicably, Howe turns to-

                          ART
           Hattie. Grab a bat.

                         
           SCOTT HATTEBERG actually points to himself and mouths,

           SCOTT pulls a bat from the rack and heads to the on-deck

           As ROY STEELE's booming voice echoes:

                         

           VOICE OF GOD
           Pinch hitting for Eric Byrnes--Scott
           Hatteberg.

                         
           Scott's wife, ELIZABETH, watches from the VIP seats. She
           clutches her face.
           SCOTT lets the first pitch go by.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           Ball!

                         
           Art Howe looks like he can't stand it any longer. In the
           dugout, Koch looks like a psychopath ready to kill.
           SCOTT steps out of the box to catch his breath. He steps
           back in and stares at the exact spot in space he thinks
           the pitch will leave the pitcher's hand.

                         
           The pitch. SCOTT swings.

           Crack! 55,000 erupt. The A's leap to the front of the
           dugout steps and watch.

                         
           We see the ball ascending on a strong trajectory, but
           before we can know for sure where it's headed, TIME SLOWS

          155 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - SAME TIME 155

           BILLY's sitting on the floor with his back against the
           wall, trying to breathe. He looks like he's in pain. He
           can't move.
           He hears the crowd ERUPT outside. His Blackberry buzzes:

                         
           "hatte homered. a's 12, ryls 11"

                         
           Billy flips on the TV. With sound off, he watches silent
           images of his team swarming the mound in (archival
           footage) mixed in with Art Howe celebrating with them.

           The place is going crazy. ELIZABETH is screaming as she
           watches her husband get mauled by his teammates at the
           plate.

                         

          159 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 159

           BILLY's still contemplating making AL history as
           celebrating players flood into the locker room just
           outside. Billy looks through a portal on the door. He's
           trapped in here now. He crosses into the

                         

          160 INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 160


                         
           The place is packed with players, coaches and news crews.
           There's no champagne spraying but they feel like they won
           the World Series and in fact have done something much
           more rare.
           Billy is trying to make a fast unnoticed exit. After
           pushing through the crowd, he walks outside of the club
           house into the -

           where the players' families and wives are waiting. Billy
           sees ELIZABETH HATTEBERG walking toward him--

           Mr. Beane? I'm Elizabeth Hatteberg. We
           met at my house last Christmas.

                         

                          BILLY
           Sure.

                         

                          ELIZABETH

          ELIZABETH starts to cry--

                         

                          BILLY
           Whoa. It's okay.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           I'm sorry.

                         

                          BILLY
           It's alright.

                          ELIZABETH
           You don't know what it's like to have
           everyone think you're a failure.

                         
          BILLY doesn't say anything but of course he does.

                          BILLY
           Well...You never thought that, and that's

                          WHAT'S--

           I did.

           And he knows I did.

                         
          BILLY takes this in a second...

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah he does know you did.

                          ELIZABETH
           He's talked to you?

                          BILLY
           No. I just know.

                          (BEAT)

           Your husband just took a Jason Grimsley
           two-seam fastball and parked it in the
           upper deck in left field for a pinch-hit
           walk-off home run in a record breaking
           game. Go tell him about it.
           ELIZABETH looks at him a moment...and then starts crying

                          AGAIN--

                          BILLY
           No it's okay now, just go.

                         
           ELIZABETH goes off to find her husband. BILLY sees PETER

           Aw, man. I spend the season trying to

           You should've seen Elizabeth's face when

                          BILLY
           She showed up afterwards.

                          BILLY
           I was a big moment for them. You know
           everyone wrote him off?

                         

                          TARA
           You didn't. You found him and you put

           I know. It was beautiful. But you
           know... it's not gonna mean a thing.

                         
           He's upset. She knows it.

                          BILLY
           Here's the thing -- we changed the game.
           We got this year, maybe next, then
           they're gonna catch on. This is our
           moment. I want to go the distance. I
           wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not
           just the Yankees, but... these guys
           deserve it.

                          TARA
           You deserve it. Honey, 20 games. It's a
           record.

                          BILLY
           That's right, it's just a record. It
           gets buried in some book. Come on, tell
           me who won 19? I don't even know. It's
           4th place at the Olympics. Any other
           team wins the World Series this year...
           great. We're still in the record books.
           But if we win, we've changed the game.
           We've put it on its head and shoved it up
           their ass. If we don't, they're gonna
           erase us.

           Minnesota Twins at Oakland A's
           The camera pans down the huge scoreboard. It's
           excruciating. The numbers on the board tell us it's been
           an incredibly close game but the A's are losing by one
           run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs and nobody
           on.

           Ray Durham stands in at the plate. Strike one to the
           Durham as we hear the venerable voice of ESPN's Joe
           Morgan, who's speaking post-game.

                         

           JOE MORGAN V/O
           The flaw in the A's thinking, and this
           comes from the top of their organization--
           is their failure to comprehend you have
           to manufacture runs in the post season.

                         
           Durham fouls off a pitch. Strike two.

                         

           JOE MORGAN V/O
           You have to steal. You have to bunt. You
           have to sacrifice. You have to trust in
           small ball, not Billy Ball.

                         
           Durham swings at the fastball and connects, but it's a
           pop fly to second which a TWINS INFIELDER easily nabs.
           The PITCHER throws his glove in the air and the CATCHER
           runs out to the mound as the rest of the Twins run to the
           middle of the field to begin their victory celebration.

                         
           Durham turns away and heads back to the dugout.
           The A's have lost the series.

                         

           JOE MORGAN V/O
           They think they've devised a science to
           win games. They think it resides in a
           computer. They thumb their nose at
           fundamentals. At tradition. At Baseball.

           still in uniform, hours after the game has ended, sitting
           with his face in his hands. After a long, deep breath he
           sits up and we discover that it's Billy, 10 years prior.

           baseball player"?

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm not a baseball player.

          169 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - DAY 169


                         

                          BILLY
           Ready to do this?
           Pete nods. Billy calls out --

                         

                          BILLY
           Suzanne? Get Schott on.

                          (TO PETER)
           You ever been to Boston?
           The speakerphone rings. Billy answers.

                         

                          BILLY
           We need to talk about the Red Sox.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           So I heard. John Henry reached out to
           you?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes. But I haven't spoken with him yet.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           That's what he said.

                         

                          BILLY
           I want your blessing before I do.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           Well, how am I supposed to react to all
           of this? You're under contract, Billy.
           You extended.

                         

                          BILLY
           I know that, Steve, but I'd like to talk
           to them. I want to see what they have to
           say.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           You're asking me to let them talk to you?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes. With your permission.

           154.

           154.

                         

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           Well, I can't do that unless I know Peter
           is in place as my GM.

                         

                          BILLY
           Pete?

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           I'm not letting you take him with you,
           and I have no idea if he's willing to
           stay if you aren't here. How do I even
           know I can come to terms with him, given
           the extremely disadvantaged bargaining
           position you're putting me in?

                          BILLY
           Well, I think you'll agree this is a
           great opportunity for him. I can't
           believe he's not going to make a deal.
          Peter is frozen. Neither Steve nor Billy are acting like
          he's even in the room.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           If you want out of your contract, I want
           their whole team and a lot of cash.
           We've invested in you.

                         

                          BILLY
           I haven't asked to get out of my
           contract, Steve, I just asked if I could
           talk to them.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           And I said I won't give you permission
           unless I know I have Peter! You can't
           leave me with a vacant front office.

                         

                          BILLY
           Then talk to Peter.

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           I will.
          Silence.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           All right. You know what? I've made it
           a point never to stand in the way of a
           man wanting to make more money. They
           made the call, the genie's out of the
           bottle. I had faith in your judgement
           when I named you GM; that's why I did it
           and I have faith in it now. Good luck,
           Billy.

           155.

           155.

                         

                         
           Billy hangs up. A long beat. Peter looks at Billy.

                         

                          PETER
           Well, I didn't see that coming.

                          BILLY
           I think you should think about staying.
           You're one of the architects of this
           thing, it belongs as much to you as it
           does to me.

                         

                          PETER
           Okay... okay...

                         

                          BILLY
           How you doing Pete?

                         

                          PETER
           I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I
           think I need to process what's happening.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why don't you take the day off.

           Billy regards culinary treats presented fancifully in a
           towncar that transports him to Fenway Park.

                         

          170 EXT. FENWAY PARK - BOSTON - DAY 170


                         
           We establish the famous home of the Red Sox before
           finding BILLY standing on home plate. He looks around at
           the historic stadium...

           JOHN (O.S.)
           Billy Beane!

                         
           JOHN HENRY, the new owner of the Boston Red Sox, is
           shouting at him from the owner's box. BILLY gives a kind
           of wave.

                         

                          HENRY
           Due respect to the Coliseum, but this is
           a ball park.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes it is. It is.

                         

                          HENRY

                          (SHOUTING)
           You ever play here?

          BILLY swinging hard at a pitch in the dirt.

                         

           CUT BACK TO:

                         

                          BILLY
           No.

                          JOHN
           That's a shame. Let's walk the field.

                         
          BILLY and JOHN begin a stroll around the perimeter of
          Fenway.

                          JOHN
           Hey, I'm sorry I kept you waiting but
           believe it or not there was snow on 84.
           The second week in October. The car
           turns on to Yawkee Way and it's 53
           degrees and this. How can there be an
           entirely different weather system here
           than there is three miles from here? Is
           that global warming or a sign that
           there's no such thing?

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't know.

                         

                          JOHN
           What's that Billy Joel song? Oh the snow
           it was falling from Stockbridge to
           Boston. And the hilltops seemed
           something because of that frosting.

                         

                          BILLY
           I think that's James Taylor and I'm
           certain those aren't the words.

                         

                          JOHN
           Well whatever, it was snowing from
           Stockbridge to Boston so I'm sorry I'm
           late. We'll have lunch in a little bit
           but why don't I have some coffee sent up.
           (he's already got his
           cell phone open)
           Denise?
           (back to BILLY)
           We've got espresso, cappuccino, latte,
           we've got a machine that makes whatever
           you want.

                          BILLY
           We've got free soda.

                          JOHN
           I heard about that.

                          (INTO PHONE)
           Can you have some coffee in there for us?

                          (BEAT)
           Thank you.

                         
           He snaps the phone shut.

          A171 INT. PRESS BOX - DAY A171


                         
           Billy and John admire the view. DENISE sets down a tray
           of coffee and exits.

                          JOHN
           It's her birthday and I need to get her a
           present but she's usually the one who
           does that for me so do you have any
           ideas?

                          BILLY

                          (PAUSE)
           A scarf?

                          JOHN
           You mean like wool?

                         

                          BILLY
           No I meant something that women wear
           with, you know, a decorative --

                          JOHN
           Sure! Excellent.

                          (PAUSE)
           And where would I get something like
           that?

                         

                          BILLY
           John, no disrespect, I just lost in five
           for the second year in a row -- give her
           a bowling ball for all I care.

                          JOHN
           Steve Schott told me he's offering you a
           new contract.

                          BILLY
           Yes he is.

                         

                          JOHN
           So why'd you return my call?

                         

                          BILLY
           You're the Red Sox, and I think I can
           help you.

                          BILLY (CONT'D)
           I think I can do something about the
           Curse of the Bambino. I heard you hired
           Bill James.

                         

                          HENRY
           Why it took someone so long to hire that
           guy is beyond me.

                         

                          BILLY
           Because baseball hates him.

                         

                          HENRY
           Money buys a lot of things. One is the
           luxury to disregard what baseball thinks.

                          BILLY
           That must be nice.
           (beat, then)
           I was grateful to get your call.

                         
          JOHN looks at BILLY a moment...

                         

                          JOHN
           You were grateful.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

                          JOHN
           For 41 million you built a playoff team.
           You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen and
           Pena and you won two more games without
           them than you did with them.
          And we begin a slow push-in on BILLY... this is the first
          person in baseball other than his assistant who doesn't
          think he's crazy.

                          JOHN
           You won the exact same number of games as
           the Yankees but the Yankees paid 1.4
           million dollars per win and you paid two-
           hundred and sixty thousand. Yes, I want
           you to be my General Manager.

                          (PAUSE)
           I know you're taking it in the teeth.
           The first guy through a wall always gets
           hurt. But those are dying voices. Any
           GM that doesn't tear down their team and
           rebuild it using your model is gonna be a
           dinosaur.

                         
          JOHN's taken a piece of paper out of his pocket and
          slides it to BILLY --

                          BILLY
           What's this?

                         

                          JOHN
           My first offer.
           BILLY opens it, looks at it for less than a second, and
           looks back up at JOHN...

          171 INT. LIMO - DAY 171


                         
           Billy looks out at the Boston scenery. He steals a
           glance at the paper in his hand, John's offer, pensive...

           Billy sits at a table. A baseball SLAMS down in front of
           him. He looks up to see where it came from. PETER is
           standing in the doorway.

                          PETER
           Heads up!

                         

                          BILLY
           Jesus. What the hell --

                          PETER
           Sorry.

                         

                          BILLY
           What the hell was that?

                          PETER
           I don't know. Sorry.

                          (THEN)
           How was Boston?

                         

                          BILLY
           Impressive.

                         

                          PETER
           You're giving me Youkilis, Billy.

           160.

           160.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Why would I ever do that?

                         

                          PETER
           Come on Billy, Schott's going to want
           something in exchange for letting you out
           of your contract and I want Youkilis.

                         

                          BILLY
           Oh, what is that, your GM voice? You
           can't have him.

                         

                          PETER
           And Cash. And a player to be named
           later.

                          BILLY
           You already have my job. What else do you
           want from me?

                         

                          PETER
           I don't want your job.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why did you take it?

                          PETER
           You didn't leave me much choice.

                          (THEN)
           Did Henry make you a good offer?

                          BILLY
           It doesn't matter.

                         

                          PETER
           Did he make you a good offer?

                         

                          BILLY
           It was fine.

                          PETER
           What was it?

                         

                          BILLY
           It doesn't matter.

                         
          Pete just stares at him. Finally, Billy reaches into his
          pocket, takes out the folded piece of paper and hands it
          to Peter.
          Peter looks at it...

                         

                          PETER
           He offered to make you the highest paid
           GM in pro sports.

           161.

           161.

                         

                         

                          BILLY

                          (GENUINELY

                          CONFLICTED)
          Do I love the Red Sox?

                          PETER
          I don't know. I've never heard you say
          you did.

                          BILLY
          So why am I doing this?

                         

                          PETER
          You're not doing it for the money.

                          BILLY
          I'm not?

                          PETER
          You're doing it for what the money says.
          It says what it says to any player who
          gets big money: that they're worth it.

                         

                          BILLY
          The offer says that. The money itself is
          redundant.

                          (BEAT)
          I made one personal decision based on
          money in my life and I swore to never do
          that again.

                          PETER
          So you're not going to Boston?

                         

                          BILLY
          I haven't decided.

                         

                          PETER
          It's all over the news that it's a done
          deal.

                          BILLY
          Look at this place. What a dump.

                          (THEN)
          I so wanted to win here.

                          PETER
          I think you've already won, Billy.

                          BILLY
          No Pete, we lost.

                         

                          PETER
          You haven't given yourself time to get
          over it, it's only been three days.

           162.

           162.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm not even over last year yet. I don't
           get over it.

                         

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
           I've got something in the video room,
           come with me.

                          BILLY
           I really can't look at video right now.

                         

                          PETER
           No, come with me.

          B177 INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY B177


                          PAUL
           It's not much more than a home movie but
           you'll get the idea.

                          BILLY
           Who is it?

                         

                          PAUL
           The Visalia Oaks and their 240 pound
           catcher, Jeremy Brown, who's scared of
           running to second. This was in a game
           six weeks ago.

                         
           PAUL hits the remote and the tape starts. The quality is
           poor and the camera is focused only on Jeremy.

                         

                          PAUL
           This guy's gonna start him off with a
           fastball low and in because he hasn't
           read the book on our guy and doesn't know
           that low and in is where he eats. Jeremy
           takes him to deep center --
           We see JEREMY BROWN connect and the ball fly off the bat
           but the camera stays on JEREMY running to first. PAUL
           slows down the picture with the remote

                         

                          PAUL
           -- and he knows that if he runs it's a
           stand-up double and he's running.

                          BILLY

                          (QUIETLY)
           Go pal.

           163.

           163.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           And now he's gonna do something he never
           does. He's gonna round first base, he's
           gonna take the turn.

                          BILLY
           Please tell me he's safe at second.

                         

                          PAUL
           No. Because right here --

                         
          JEREMY slips and stumbles to the ground.

                         

                          PAUL
           -- is what he's always been afraid of.
           It's all he can do to get himself back to
           first.
          JEREMY has been scrambling in the dirt to get safely back
          to first base.

                         

                          BILLY
           What is that?

                         

                          PAUL
           That's the first base coach.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why's he laughing? I'm gonna fire that
           guy, why the hell is he --

                         

                          PAUL
           Everybody's laughing.

                         
          JEREMY's looking around the field now, looking at his own
          dugout. We can't see what he sees but he's confused.

                          PAUL
           And now Jeremy finds out why. Watch his
           face because this is art. He's just
           found out the ball went 60 feet over the
           fence. He'd hit a home run but he didn't
           know it.

                         
          And JEREMY's face explodes into a smile. He slaps hands
          with the first base coach and begins his trot around the
          bases.
          BILLY stares at this. He takes the remote and backs it
          up a little so he can see Jeremy's face again.

                         

                          BILLY
           How can anybody not be romantic about
           baseball?

                          PAUL

                          (PAUSE)
           It was a metaph--

                         

                          BILLY
           I know it was a metaphor.

                         

                          PAUL
           That was a hell of a baseball season,
           boss.

                         

                          BILLY
           The Island of Misfit Toys. Okay.

                         
           And with that, Billy's mind begins to go elsewhere. No
           resolution, no decision, other than to get up and wander
           on.

           BILLY's driving along and listening to the continued
           DRONE of talk radio criticism.

           RADIO VOICE (V.O.)

           ARCHIVAL RADIO CHATTER

                         
           BILLY keeps listening a moment, then reaches in the glove
           box and pulls out a CD marked "Dad's Mix".

                         
           BILLY slips it in the CD player. The sound of the radio
           immediately snaps off and the momentary silence is soon
           broken by CASEY's VOICE--

                         

           CASEY (V.O.)
           Hey, Dad. I picked these songs out just
           for you.
           And then the first track on the CD comes on (SONG TBD).

                         
           And BILLY smiles.
           He continues on down the freeway into dusk, as--

           Legend: Boston never traded to Billy - or anyone else -
           their Greek God of Walks, Kevin Youkilis. He was part of
           the historic World Series Championship Red Sox of 2004,
           and is still with the club.

           Billy - 18 years old - in his Mount Carmel High uniform,
           takes his stance at the plate with the supreme confidence
           of youth. The pitch comes. He swings. And as his bat
           makes contact - freeze.
           Legend: Billy Beane is still the General Manager of the

           The Coliseum's floodlights switch off and the green of
           the grass darkens -

    Helium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and
    blown through space by solar winds.

    It plays an essential role in Cold Fusion, often toted as
    the solution to humanity's future energy needs.

    There is one major problem...

    Helium3 is extremely scarce on Earth. The gas does,
    however, exist in abundance on the Earth's only natural
    satellite:

    The Moon.

    Should we turn to Cold Fusion in the future, it is
    conceivable that man will mine the Moon for Helium3 and
    bring the precious gas back to Earth...

                                                                          2.




                                                 IN THE BLACK:

    We hear something -- a machine -- CHURNING and POUNDING.
    Constant. Rhythmic. Though the sound is slightly familiar,
    we're not sure what it is yet. Hold for a few seconds and
    then

                                                      CUT TO:


1   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      1

    The sound belongs to a regular old TREADMILL like you see
    in most gyms across the world. Running on it: SAM BELL, mid
    thirties, thick beard, handsome, striking blue eyes.

    Sam's face is flushed and glistening with sweat. He lunges
    for a towel draped over the treadmill's bar, dabs his face
    as he runs.

    We see OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: A gray, powdery landscape
    stretching beneath a BLACK SKY.

                                                      CUT TO:


2   EXT. MOON -- MORNING                                          2

    Aerial view of the Earth's only natural satellite, the
    camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface.

    Desolation. Serious, uncompromising, desolation. This place
    makes Antarctica look like Tokyo.

    And utter silence.

    Eventually the camera arrives at a moon base, DIVING DOWN
    towards it --

    TITLE CARD: "MINING BASE SELENE. CREW: 1."

                                                      CUT TO:


3   INT. BATHROOM\SHOWER -- MORNING                               3

    Sam takes a shower, treading in a tight circle beneath the
    nozzle, eyes closed, hot water blasting his face.

                                                                       3.




4   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               4

    His hair still wet from the shower, Sam sits before a COMMS
    UNIT, dressed in a "Lunar Industries" boiler suit, a zip up
    the front, colorful patches sewn into the arms. He begins
    to record a message.

                        SAM
              Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you,
              sweetheart? It's the morning
              here. In a few minutes Gerty and
              I will sit down for breakfast, go
              over the day's itinerary.

    As Sam continues his message, we are given a TOUR of the
    mining base. Beginning with:


5   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       5

    This is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan. The
    base's equivalent of HQ. A wall of computers and flickering
    digital displays.

                        SAM (V.O.)
              Today begins my 154th week on
              Selene. I officially have two
              weeks to go before I climb into
              that Return Vehicle...


6   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                           6

    A small space craft attached to the base. It is essentially
    a tiny room with a coffin like, sealed bed in the middle of
    it: a cryogenic POD with an array of complicated controls
    surrounding it.

                        SAM (V.O.)
              And blast home.


7   INT. REC ROOM                                                 7

    Sam spends most of his time here. It is kitchen and play
    room combined. We PICK OUT a television set, an armchair, a
    Ping-Pong table, the treadmill.

                        SAM (V.O.)
              I never dreamed I'd make it this
              far.

                                                                           4.




     DETAIL: A WOODEN MODEL

     On a table, we also PICK OUT a LARGE MODEL carved out of
     BOLSER WOOD. It's a TOWN. Intricately done down to the
     tiniest details.

                         SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               There were times, as you know...

     We go even CLOSER to the model, seeing that there are
     actual people, actual characters in the little town; actual
     buildings: a CHURCH, a TOWN HALL, etc. Clearly someone has
     put a ton of work into this thing.

                         SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...when I thought I was going to
               crack up.


8    INT. GREENHOUSE                                               8

     And the tour of the base continues. Onto a new room. A dark         
     storage area Sam has repurposed to grow a handful of                
     plants. They sit surrounded by darkness, glowing under              
     pools of artificial light.                                          

                         SAM (V.O.)
               But I think I've come out the
               other side now.


9    INT. INFIRMARY                                                9

     A strange angular room, obviously purposeful, but its               
     design more geared to a computer than a human being. A              
     single bed dominates.                                               

                         SAM (V.O.)
               In many ways, this place is all
               about contradictions.


10   EXT. LUNAR LANDSCAPE                                          10

     The empty terrain surrounding the mining base, as viewed
     from the Monitoring Station window. Across the landscape a
     mountain rises from the morning shadows.

                         SAM (V.O.)
               It's bleak, it's beautiful.


     CLOSE UP -- A HAND TOOL

     Some kind of rake or shovel half buried in the powdery
     soil, like a child's toy abandoned in a sand box.

                                                                        5.



                            SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  It's barren, yet filled with
                  riches.


11   EXT. EARTH -- AS SEEN FROM THE MOON                         11

     From up here it is easy to see why the Earth is sometimes
     referred to as "the blue marble." A swirl of color.

                            SAM (V.O.)
                  The earth is thousands and
                  thousands of miles away, but
                  sometimes looks so close I feel
                  like I could reach out and snatch
                  it with my hand.


12   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      12

     Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few
     knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky
     tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress
     ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --

                            SAM (V.O.)
                  I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm
                  never alone...

     We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.


     PHOTOGRAPH

     Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms
     wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.

                            SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  Because I have you.

     Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife
     of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive
     hairdo.

     Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly
     beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave
     behind.

     Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.

                            SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  And I have Eve. I don't take you
                  guys for granted. You know that
                  now.

                                                                           6.




13   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               13

     Back with Sam at the Comms Unit as he wraps up the message.

                         SAM
               Please kiss Eve for me. And tell
               her daddy will only be away a
               little longer -- seventeen days
               longer, approximately. I love you
               both dearly. Bye.

     And he sends the message.


                                                     CUT TO:


14   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 14

     The main corridor connecting the different rooms. We've
     seen everything there is to see now. The base is small.
     Confined. Claustrophobic. It is easy to imagine how someone
     could crack up here.

     Sam leaves the Comms Room and heads down the corridor.


15   INT. REC ROOM                                                 15

     A state of the art robot, a GERTY 3000 -- known simply as
     "GERTY" -- is preparing Sam's breakfast.

     Gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal
     rail that runs throughout the base. He has a readout screen
     that perpetually spews data. His hands resemble pincers,
     but are perfectly nimble.

     For the purposes of helping run the base and looking after
     Sam, Gerty is as good as human, if not better.

     Sam enters.

                         SAM
               Morning, Gerty.

                         GERTY
               Morning, Sam. How are you today?

                         SAM
               Fine. Fine. You?

                         GERTY
               I'm very well. How's your
               headache?

                                                                           7.



                           SAM
                 Much better, thanks, pal.

     Sam treats Gerty more like a person than a robot. Whether
     this is down to Gerty's intelligence or Sam's desperation
     for company isn't clear just yet.

     Note: Gerty talks like a well-educated older man. His
     language doesn't have a great deal of inflection (i.e.
     Monotone) but he is friendly enough.

     Sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static -
     - he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks.
     We hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it
     before he allows it to play on, on some random American
     station -- an old weather report:

                           VOICE ON RADIO
                 ...it's a hot one on the East
                 Coast, temperatures soaring to a
                 high of ninety three degrees in
                 New York City --

     They zip around the tiny kitchen, together preparing Sam's
     breakfast, working as a team.

                                                     CUT TO:


16   EXT. MOON                                                     16

     We take in the whole Moon at once. Gray, colorless, eerie.
     From this distance the surface resembling Plaster of Paris.


17   INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                                17

     Sam sits before Selene's main computer, known as THE OLD
     MAN. Data flickering off Sam's face. He is making a log
     entry. A CLOCK is running on the monitor.

                           SAM
                 8:32 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1.
                 All Harvesters running smoothly
                 this morning. Readouts are as
                 follows: Matthew, 14.6 miles;
                 Mark 16.8 miles...

     Sam continues with his entry while we

                                                     CUT TO:

                                                                        8.




18   INT. STORAGE CUBBY                                           18

     Gerty is selecting food for the up-coming week, stacking
     ready-meals on a small fork-lift buggy.

                                                     CUT TO:


19   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      19


     A RED LIGHT

     Pulsing rapidly. The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.


     BOARD

     Sam stands before the Big Board. The names of the four
     Harvesters (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) in a collum. The red
     light is flashing next to Matthew.

     Sam presses an INTERCOM BUTTON, dips down, speaks into it.

                           SAM
                 Gerty, we've got a live one on
                 Mark. I'm going out now to rope
                 her in.

                              GERTY'S VOICE
                 Okay, Sam.

     Sam heads off.


20   INT. CHANGING AREA                                           20

     A SPACE SUIT

     Resembling an unmanned puppet. Sam begins to insinuate his
     body into the suit.


21   INT. DOCK                                                    21

     Three Rovers (moon buggies) parked in their separate bays.
     The Rovers are caked in lunar soil, as though sand blasted.

     In his space suit Sam bends into one of the Rovers, starts
     the engine.

                                                                          9.




22   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                      22

     Sam drives along, dwarfed by an enormous lunar bolder and
     the rising slopes of the valley beyond. A toy car in this
     vast and alien terrain.


23   EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                  23

     The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as
     Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank
     and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.

     Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back
     of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and
     dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.


24   INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                           24

     Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --
     not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once
     safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in
     the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.

     Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to
     indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.

     Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of
     Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a
     special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.

     A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.

     Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses
     out of the Harvester carefully.


25   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                      25

     Sam snakes through the soil on his way back to base, the
     tracks of the Rover as sharp as if they had been made
     through talcum powder. The Harvester churns into the
     distance.

     Sam loads the filled pod into a CARGO CONTAINER. The Cargo
     Container is about the size of a fridge and can take a
     maximum of five pods. There are four pods already inside,
     Sam's new pod taking up the fifth and final slot.

                                                                       10.




27   INT. COMMS ROOM                                            27

     Sam is seated at the Comms Unit recording a message for his
     superiors back on Earth.

                          SAM
                Sam Bell reporting to Central.
                10:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1.
                    (less formal)
                Overmeyers, Thompson? It's Sam.
                How goes it? I've got a full
                container of Helium3 ready to
                roll. The purity is pretty good,
                so assuming your last market
                prices are still relevant I think
                you are looking at getting about
                3 million dollars per kilo with
                this load. By the time this
                message reaches you it should be
                in transit.
                    (a beat)
                Otherwise, everything running
                smoothly. There was a discrepancy
                between a couple of the N3000
                modulators a couple of days ago,
                but Gerty and I caught it in
                time, no big deal. Uh...how are
                things down there?

     Sam desperately wants to talk but has nothing very
     important to say. Then he remembers something.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Oh, and I just wanted to thank
                you for sending out the football
                feed. Almost felt live!
                    (getting pissed off)
                Seriously, I don't mean to be an
                asshole, but surely replacing one
                satellite cant be that fucking
                hard! I haven't been able to
                have a conversation with my
                wife... My kid can talk now...!
                Fuck!

     Sam concentrates, getting a grip on his temper.

                Two weeks. Two weeks.
                    (beat)
                Hey. Three years is a long haul.
                If you guys want to run some
                psych evals on me when I get
                back, I'm happy to do it. It
                ain't Disney World up here.
                    (a beat)
                That's it. Over and out.

                                                                       11.



     Sam reaches forward, sends the message.

                                                     CUT TO:


28   INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY                                         28

     Sam is loading the Cargo Container into the base's MAGLEV
     LAUNCHER. He works with a sense of routine, far away,
     preoccupied.

     All of a sudden Sam STOPS. He has the feeling someone is
     standing behind him. He slowly turns.

     A GIRL is standing in the doorway watching him. She is
     perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old. A yellow dress. Long,
     wheat-colored hair. Freckles. At once beautiful and
     haunting.

     Sam gets the FRIGHT of his life. He FLIES against the wall.

     WIDEN to reveal Sam and the Girl facing off. Sam POP-EYED
     and SHAKING. The Girl IMMOBILE, arms at her sides, head
     tilted ever so slightly to one side.

     The Cargo Container is sent hurtling through space. A              
     TERRIFIC BLAST. It distracts Sam's attention, breaks his           
     stare...                                                           

     And just like that, the Girl is gone. Sam is just staring
     at an empty doorway. Nothing there.

     Sam is baffled. Had to be his imagination. Had to be. After
     a few seconds he shakes his head dismissively and continues
     working.

29   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                         29

     Gerty is cutting Sam's hair.

     Sam sitting back in a chair, barber shop style, while the
     robot snip-snip-snips away with a pair of scissors. Sam is
     gently squeezing a STRESS BALL in his right hand.

                          GERTY
                Sam, is everything okay?

                          SAM
                Everything's fine, Gerty.

     For a moment there is no sound but the snipping scissors,
     reminiscent of keys snapping on a typewriter. Then:

                                                                  12.



                     SAM (CONT'D)
           Why do you ask?

                     GERTY
           You don't seem like yourself
           today.

Sam frowns, contemplative. For a moment we think he is
going to tell Gerty about the Girl he saw earlier -- or
imagined he saw. But he goes with something different.

                        SAM
           It's Tess.

                     GERTY
           Has something happened?

                     SAM
           No, not exactly.

Gerty stops cutting, lowers the scissors.

                     GERTY
           Sam, what is it?

                     SAM
           Something doesn't feel right,
           that's all.

A beat. Sam's fingers twitching around the red stress ball,
squeezing harder.

                     GERTY
           Sam, it might help to talk about
           it.

Sam decides to come clean.

                     SAM
           Tess isn't responding to things.

                     GERTY
           Tess isn't responding to things?

                        SAM
           Right.

                     GERTY
           What kind of things?

                     SAM
               (a beat)
           A couple of weeks ago I asked her
           if she wanted to go on vacation
           when I get back, and that I was
           thinking of either Mexico or
           Hawaii.
                     (MORE)

                                                                    13.

                     SAM (CONT'D)
           Tess never said anything about
           it. Three messages she's sent me
           since...and she's never once
           mentioned the vacation.

                     GERTY
           Im sure she can't wait, Sam.

                     SAM
           That's not the point. This is
           someone who lives for vacations
           and travelling. I thought she'd
           jump at the chance for us to go
           away -- with Eve, of course --
           we'd take Eve.

                     GERTY
           Perhaps Tess didn't receive the
           message?

                     SAM
               (as if anticipating
                Gerty's comment)
           But this isn't the only time it's
           happened, Gerty. When I asked her
           how her dad was doing on his new
           heart medicine she didn't respond
           to that -- I asked her when Eve
           was going to start nursery --
           nothing. Had her brother got the
           position at the University?
           Nothing. Nothing.

Sam is really having a go at the stress ball now.

                     GERTY
           I think her brother did get the
           position at the University. His
           name is Christopher, correct?

                     SAM
           He did?

                     GERTY
           Yes, I seem to recall he got the
           position. Professor of
           Biochemistry, I think. At
           Syracuse University in New York?

Sam is slightly alarmed that Gerty knows this and he
doesn't.

                     SAM
           How do you know that?

                                                                  14.



                      GERTY
           You told me. Some time ago now.
           Towards the beginning of your
           time on Selene. When we were
           starting to get to know each
           other.
               (a beat)
           You were very happy for your
           brother-in-law. You danced around
           the Rec Room, if I remember
           correctly.

Sam looks perturbed. For a few seconds he'd eased up on the
stress ball. He starts up on it again now.

                     SAM
           Gerty, have you heard anything
           new about anyone fixing lunar
           sat?

                     GERTY
           No Sam. From what I understand
           it's fairly low on the companies
           priority list with the Jupiter
           mission active. I would imagine                     
           it would be very expensive to                       
           fix.                                                

A pause. Sam still looks troubled.

                     GERTY (CONT'D)
           Sam, are you ok?

                     SAM
           They need to sort that out.
           Seriously. I've only got two
           weeks left. It's not fair on
           whoever's up here next. Gerty,
           you tell them to sort it out.
           It's not healthy.

                     GERTY
           I will Sam. Do you want me to
           finish cutting your hair later?

                    SAM
           Nah. Come on.   Let's finish
           this.

Gerty resumes cutting Sam's hair, and stops again, sensing
Sam is going to say something more.

The scissors freeze.

                                                                         15.



                          SAM (CONT'D)
                I've got another one of those
                headaches. Can you get me
                something for it?

                          GERTY
                Of course. Now?

                          SAM
                No not now, afterwards.

     The scissors start up again.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Thanks, pal.

     Sam with a HAIRCUT and a neatly TRIMMED BEARD is sitting
     before the Bolser Wood model of the little town.

     He is arched over working away with an EXACTO BLADE --
     SQUINTING -- whittling a figure out of wood. This is
     difficult and complicated work, and over three years Sam
     has become highly skilled at it.

     Sam can carve an actual person out of wood -- actual
     cheekbones, actual throats, actual hands -- it's
     fascinating to watch.

     From another room Sam hears the "ping-ping-ping" of an
     alarm.

33   INT. COMMS ROOM                                            33

     Sam sits at the comms unit watching a message from his
     superiors, OVERMEYERS and THOMPSON, a purposeful looking
     woman in charge and her earnest second.

     The two talk RAPIDLY and trade off like a tag team. At
     times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical.

     Overmeyers and Thompson seem to have known Sam for a while,
     but even so, there is a practised casualness to the
     repartee. It's a professional friendliness on Overmeyers
     part, no more and for Thompson it's merely an eagerness to
     be involved.

                          OVERMEYERS
                Delighted to hear about the
                latest shipment, Sam.

                          THOMPSON
                According to Albatross 90 it
                should be landing off the
                California Coast within the next
                three days.

                          OVERMEYERS
                Now in response to your question
                about the communications
                equipment, the news is not good.

                           THOMPSON
                Sam, those solar storms did a lot
                more damage than initially
                thought --

                          OVERMEYERS
                Fixing the lunar sat is going to
                take some time. It's a
                significant operation.

                          THOMPSON
                And what with the Jupiter Program
                hemorrhaging money --

     Sam curses to himself.                                           

                          OVERMEYERS
                Lunar doesn't have the budget it
                once did, Sam, you know that.

                          THOMPSON
                Even the coffee machine down in
                the Hub has been broken since I
                don't know when --

                                                                       17.



                          OVERMEYERS
                We have to go to Genesis 3 just
                to get a decent cup of coffee,
                Sam. Genesis 3. That's three
                buildings over.

                           THOMPSON
                We're hoping to get the live feed
                up and running by the Fall. The
                good news is you'll be home by
                then, Sam.

                          OVERMEYERS
                You only have two weeks to go!
                Congrat--

     Sam shuts off the message before Overmeyers can pipe out
     his last line.

     Sam sits before the dead screen -- eyes closed -- taking a
     succession of DEEP BREATHS.

     FRUSTRATION out on the little white ball.

                                                     CUT TO:


35   INT. BATHROOM -- DAY                                         35

     Sam stands before the toilet urinating. Rather ironically
     he is whistling I'm Walking on Sunshine -- focussed ahead
     at his reflection in the mirror -- angling his face,
     admiring his haircut, his beard.

     Then he looks down to flush the toilet and his WHISTLING
     abruptly STOPS.


36   INT. BATHROOM\TOILET                                         36

     It looks like someone just poured a glass of CRANBERRY
     JUICE into the toilet bowl. Literally. The red urine
     clouding the water like a squirt of octopus ink. Yeah, Sam
     just pissed blood.

     There is a "PING!" and Gerty's voice crackles from the
     intercom.

                                                                        18.



                          GERTY'S VOICE
                Sam, a transmission has arrived
                from your wife.

     Sam reaches over and presses the INTERCOM BUTTON.

                          SAM
                Be right there.

     And he flushes the toilet.

                                                      CUT TO:


37   INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                       37

     Sam sitting before the monitor. He hits the "PLAY" button,
     begins watching the message.

     ON THE MONITOR: Tess is sitting in a living room talking to
     Sam. Tess has a sweet voice, she sounds grounded, like
     she's got a head on her shoulders.

                           TESS
                Hi Sam. It's me. How are you?
                     (a beat)
                I got your last message, it was
                really great to hear your voice.
                I know you've been really lonely
                up there, but in a lot of ways
                it's been good for you, I think.
                I hope you don't mind me saying
                that. I'm proud of you.
                     (a beat)
                Hey, someone's got something to
                say.

     A WOMAN, possibly a nanny or some form of hired help,
     swings a LITTLE GIRL into Tess's arms. This is EVE, Sam and
     Tess's daughter.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
                Eve, it's daddy. What did you
                want to say to him?

      Eve just stares. Tess whispers to her ("Remember what we
      practiced", etc.) Finally Eve attempts:

                            EVE
                Asstraut.

                          TESS
                Who's an astronaut?
                    (encouraging)
                Go on!

                                                                         19.



                          EVE
                Daddy asstraut!

     Tess laughs. So does Sam.

                          TESS
                That's right, daddy's an
                astronaut. Clever girl!

     Eve fidgets, rubs her nose, distracted.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
                She's shy. Uh, Cathy, could
                you...?

     The Maid steps in, hoists Eve away. Tess waits until
     they're out of earshot.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
                It's her birthday next month. I
                thought we'd get her a play house
                for the garden. We could even
                pick it out together.

     A pause. Tess just stares into the camera. She is hundreds
     and thousands of miles away, but for a second it feels like
     she's right there in the Comms Room with Sam. It's
     intimate.

     She finally shakes her head, self-conscious, shy.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
                God, I hate these things. Sam, I
                love you. I'm thinking of you
                always. I can't wait to see you,
                sweetheart. Okay. Bye.

     And the message ends.

     ON SAM: smiling, on the brink of tears.

                                                     CUT TO:


38   EXT. THE EARTH -- NIGHT/LATER                                38

     The Earth at night, illuminated by a glittering spider's
     web of artificial lighting. From the Moon this is one of
     the most beautiful sights you'll ever see.


39   INT. REC ROOM -- SAME                                        39

     Sam is in improved spirits. He pours himself a glass of
     juice as Gerty prepares dinner.

                                                                        20.



                          SAM
                What's on the menu tonight,
                Gerty?

                          GERTY
                Baby back ribs with french fries
                and spinach.

                          SAM
                Ribs! Good choice, pal. Fine
                choice.

     It might be baby back ribs with french fries and spinach,
     but it's made from a packet by adding hot water. Nasty.

     Sam sits down with the packet. Digs in with a fork.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Oh yeah! Compliments to the chef,
                Gerty, this is delicious!

     Sam eating ravenously.

                                                     CUT TO:


40   INT. GREENHOUSE -- NIGHT                                     40

     Sam is in the Greenhouse pruning plants with a pair of
     secateurs. He treads up the aisles slowly, taking time with
     each of the plants. CLASSICAL MUSIC plays over the sound
     system, Brahms, Beethoven, Bartok, one of the B's.

     Sam HUMS along to the music. A man at peace.

                                                     CUT TO:


41   INT. REC ROOM -- NIGHT/LATER                                 41

     Sam is working on his wooden model of the town. Across the
     room the Ed Sullivan Show is on TV. Ed's guest is a very
     young Goldie Hawn.

     Note: Whenever any TV is watched in the film, it is always
     a show from 1970's America. (Mash, Six Million Dollar Man,
     Laugh-In, etc.) No explanation is given for this.

     Sam is half-watching the TV, but his focus is chiefly on
     the SMALL HOUSE he is carving. And carving beautifully.

     After a few seconds he stands and snaps off the TV with a
     remote. He crosses to the kitchen section of the Rec Room
     to make some tea. The water has just boiled.

     As Sam is about to pour the boiling water, tea kettle in
     hand, he glances across the Rec Room and sees:

                                                                       21.



     The Girl. She's taken Sam's chair before the model. She is
     motionless, staring down at the model like she recognizes
     one of the little figures walking the tiny streets.

     Sam calmly puts the tea kettle down and begins to move
     towards the Girl, slowly, cautiously, like he wants to
     sneak up on her.

     Sam walks right up to the Girl and reaches out his hand...


     SAM

     And then we CUT to Sam standing in the kitchen. Over by the
     model there is no sign of the Girl. The chair is empty.
     She's gone. Her sitting there, Sam's walk across the room --
     apparently he imagined it all.

     Sam looks down. The tea kettle is dangling at an angle and
     BOILING WATER is DRIBBLING onto his left hand.

     Simultaneously: Sam SNAPS his hand AWAY, Sam SCREAMS. The
     tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor.

     Sam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream
     of cold water. Cursing under his breath the whole time:
     "Shit, piss, fuck..."

                                                     CUT TO:


42   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      42

     Sam sits in a chair as Gerty tends to his scolded left
     hand. It's a nasty burn.

                           SAM
                I'm going to feel that for a
                while, aren't I, Gerty?
                    (then)
                Damn it.

     Gerty applies a translucent balm to the burn.

                          GERTY
                Sam, can I ask how it happened?

                          SAM
                I told you, I saw something on
                the TV and spilled boiling water
                on my hand.

                          GERTY
                You saw something on the TV?

                                                                          22.



                          SAM
                    (a touch petulant)
                Yeah, something on the TV
                distracted me, Gerty, what's
                wrong with that?

     A pause. Gerty is wrapping Sam's hand with a bandage.

                          GERTY
                Sam, you said it was the TV that
                distracted you, but when I came
                in the TV wasn't on.

     Gerty has caught him out. Sam knows it.

                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Perhaps you were imagining
                things?

     Gerty has hit the nail on the head, in a way that makes Sam
     feel a little uneasy. Is there something Gerty knows that
     Sam doesn't?

                                                     CUT TO:


43   INT. THE SLEEPING QUARTERS -- NIGHT                           43

     Sam asleep in bed.


44   SAM'S DREAM                                                   44

     Sam making love to Tess. We remain very close to their
     bodies in bed. The background a blur. No sound. It's all
     flesh and white sheets. Sensual, delicate, intense. We feel
     almost intrusive watching.


45   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- MORNING                             45

     Sam wakes up and lunges across the bed to shut off his
     alarm clock. We notice a WHITE BANDAGE on the hand that he
     scolded.

     Afterwards: Sam lies back, watching the ceiling, groggy,
     reflective, still surfacing from his dream.

     And then OVER THIS: The sound from the opening of the film,
     THE TREADMILL, and we

                                                     CUT TO:


46   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      46

     Sam on his morning run.

                                                                          23.




47   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                                47

     Gerty is making breakfast. Sam enters, fresh from the
     shower.

                          SAM
                Morning, Gerty.

                          GERTY
                Morning, Sam. How are you today?

                          SAM
                Fine. Fine.

                          GERTY
                How's the hand?

                          SAM
                It's a little sore.

     Gerty pops the radio on. Just another morning on Selene.

                                                     CUT TO:


48   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MORNING/LATER                      48

     Sam sitting before The Old Man doing his daily log entry. A
     CLOCK is running on the monitor.

                          SAM
                8:19 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 2.
                Readouts are as follows: Matthew,
                9.8 Miles...

     Suddenly the monitor BLIPS -- a BLAST of STATIC -- and Sam
     SEES himself talking on the monitor. It appears to be a
     previous log entry.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Luke...7.3 miles...wow, better
                look into Luke...

     But bizarrely, the Sam talking on the monitor has long hair
     pulled back into a ponytail -- and no beard --

     And then another BLIP -- another BLAST of STATIC --   and
     the screen turns completely BLACK.

     A single word begins to flash in the center of the screen:
     "ERROR."

     The word flashes three times -- before the screen returns
     to normal, the CLOCK running again.

                                                                          24.



     It all happened so quickly Sam wonders if he didn't just
     imagine it. After an awkward pause he simply continues the
     original log entry.

                           SAM (CONT'D)
                 Mark, 11 miles on the button...


     CLOSE UP -- RED LIGHT

     Pulsing. Going "ping-ping-ping."


49   INT. MONITORING STATION -- LATER/MORNING                      49

     Sam stands across the room with a mug of coffee, peers up
     at the Big Board, sees that the alarm belongs to Matthew.

     He crosses to the INTERCOM, speaks into it.

                           SAM
                 Gerty, looks like we've got a
                 live one out on Matthew. I
                 wondered what was taking him so
                 long, the old fart. I'm heading
                 out in a few minutes, just going
                 to finish my coffee.

                              GERTY'S VOICE
                 Okay, Sam.

                                                     CUT TO:


50   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MORNING                            50

     Sam at the wheel in his space suit, speeding towards the
     first of the Harvesters, known as MATTHEW.


     HARVESTER/MATTHEW

     As Sam gets closer to the Harvester, he suddenly sees
     something:

     The Girl.

     She is standing maybe a hundred yards away in her yellow
     dress, resembling a FLAME or a FLOWER in the barren and
     colorless landscape. She appears to be staring directly at
     Sam's rover.


     SAM

     His face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity. An
     intense, yearning, curiosity.

                                                                       25.



     He drives closer.

     But like in a dream, Sam can't seem to make up any distance
     between the Rover and the Girl. He CRUSHES the accelerator
     peddle.

     For a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester,
     clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the
     side window. But Sam is looking away from the Harvester,
     focussed on the Girl.

     ON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly
     veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing
     Sam to lose control.

     The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately
     tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split
     second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN
     into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of
     MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the
     Harvester, DEVOURED.

     The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE,
     resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG,
     BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL.

     WIDE SHOT: Silence. The Harvester stationary. The Rover
     caught beneath it.

     No sign of the Girl.

                                                     CUT TO:


     BLACK.

     Silence. Hold it for five seconds and then


51   A BLUR                                                       51

     Eyelids fluttering, bright light, at first broken up,
     filtered, as if viewed through a Kaleidoscope. Slowly
     shapes and impressions begin to form and we know where we
     are.

     It's the Infirmary.


52   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                        52

     A CLEAN SHAVEN and drugged-up Sam is sitting up in bed,
     propped with a pillow. Sam doesn't have a scratch on his
     face, but has clearly been through a terrifying ordeal.

     Gerty is bedside.

                                                                         26.



                          SAM
                Where am I?

                          GERTY
                Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You
                had an accident.

     Sam looks bewildered -- he desperately racks his brain,
     trying to locate the memory.

                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Do you remember what happened?

                          SAM
                No.
                    (a beat)
                I don't remember a thing.

     Sam just stares back at Gerty, not so much as a flicker of
     recognition.

                          GERTY
                Do you remember me?

                          SAM
                Yes, of course I remember you,
                Gerty.

                          GERTY
                That's good. That's very good.
                It's nice to see you awake again.
                    (a beat)
                I'd like to keep you under
                observation here in the Infirmary
                for a few days and run some
                tests.

     A pause. Sam taking it all in. Eventually:

                          SAM
                How long have I been out?

                          GERTY
                Not long. Sam, go back to sleep.
                You're still very tired. We can
                talk later.

     Sam closes his eyes, sinking deeper into his pillow.

     Sam asleep in bed. Gerty is scanning his head with a small
     instrument resembling a camcorder.

                                                                       27.


     There are READOUTS on a monitor showing blood flow, oxygen
     levels and glucose metabolism in the tissues of Sam's
     brain.

     LUKE, one of the Harvesters, crossing the lunar landscape
     at HALF SPEED.


55   INT. INFIRMARY                                               55

     Sam wakes up from an extended nap. He thrusts his fists
     into his eyes like a child, yawns ferociously.

                          SAM
                Gerty?

     No sign of the robot. Sam is feeling well enough to walk.
     He swings his legs out of bed, begins to plod around the
     room. He is tentative at first, slow, as if walking is
     something he is having to learn from scratch.

     Eventually when he is moving fluidly he goes to the door
     and pokes his head out into the corridor.


56   INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS                                  56

     Sam peers around. From another room he can hear the faint
     drone of VOICES. One of these voices belongs to Gerty. The
     other voices are deeper, faster, human.

                          SAM
                Gerty?

     The voices continue. Intrigued, Sam PRESSES ON down the
     corridor.


     ON SAM

     As he walks up the corridor in the direction of the Comms
     Room. Sam is close enough now that he can actually hear the
     conversation.

     Sam arrives at the door of the Comms Room and peers in.

                          GERTY (0.S)
                These were extraordinary
                circumstances, as you know --

                                                                         28.




57   INT. COMMS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                57

     Gerty is installed at the Comms Unit. Thompson and
     Overmeyers are on the screen.

     The moment Gerty sees Sam he shuts off the monitor and the
     screen fizzes to black, Thompson and Overmeyers vanishing.

     Strange: Gerty appeared to have a live feed.

                          GERTY
                Sam, you're out of bed.

                           SAM
                I wanted to stretch my legs.
                    (then)
                What was that?

                           GERTY
                Not talking. No. We've been
                having some problems with the
                lunar sat and our live feed seems
                to be down. I was recording a
                video message for Central
                updating them on your progress.
                     (a beat)
                Sam, you need to stay in bed.
                You're not ready to walk around
                yet.

     Sam nods vaguely, turns around and heads back to the
     Infirmary slowly.

     Sam watching TV -- The Muppet Show, the "Pigs in Space"
     sketch -- and eating dinner. He's not laughing.


59   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      59

     Sam hunched over the infirmary's stainless steel wash basin
     giving himself a shave. He hits the razor on the side of
     the basin -- tap tap tap -- like a conductor with a baton.

                                                     CUT TO:


60   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      60

     Sam is seated at a table. Frankly he looks better now than
     he did before the accident.

                                                                       29.


     Perhaps it's the rosy hue of his freshly shaven face. He
     certainly looks younger. A man revitalized, a man mended.

     Gerty is giving Sam something very similar to an IQ Test.
     Sam has just arranged a series of blocks into an L-shaped
     tower.

                          GERTY
                Excellent, Sam.

                          SAM
                How much longer do I have to be
                in here, Gerty?

                          GERTY
                Sam, you suffered minor brain
                damage in the crash. This has
                resulted in memory loss and
                slight logic impairment.

                          SAM
                When can I get back to work?

                          GERTY
                Central has asked me to slow down
                the Harvesters to ensure you have
                time to recuperate and get your
                strength back --

                          SAM
                    (dryly, exasperated)
                Terrific.

                          GERTY
                The good news is you can return
                to the sleeping quarters
                tomorrow. But it will still be a
                few more days before you can
                resume anything like a normal
                work schedule.

     Sam's face taught with irritation. He isn't happy.

     Gerty gives him the next puzzle to solve. WE MOVE IN ON
     SAM'S LEFT HAND as he takes the puzzle, the same hand he
     scolded in an earlier scene.

     The BANDAGE is GONE and the BURN appears to have completely
     HEALED.

                                                     CUT TO:

     Sam walking down the corridor in the direction of the
     Sleeping Quarters. He stops at a RED LIGHT on the corridor
     wall, beneath it the word, "EXIT DOORS."

                                                                       30.



     He's locked inside the base.

     Sam pulls a face, disgruntled, continues down the corridor.


62   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS                       62

     Sam takes in the New York Jets poster on the wall and walks
     over to the bed -- studies his lucky tambourine and the
     glass jar of lunar rock samples -- like he's trying to
     reacquaint himself with his own belongings.

     His eyes arrive on the red stress ball. Sam scoops up the
     ball and PITCHES it at the wall like he expects the thing
     to bounce back to him. The stress ball doesn't bounce back,
     simply hits the wall with a dull THUD and DROPS to the
     FLOOR.

     A desolation special. The blacker than black sky above.
     None of the ingredients of life. On Earth we have
     rainforests, and flowers, and birds. We have color. Up here
     we realize how lucky we are. The base is lit by large
     halogen comfort lights, alone in the lunar desert. This is
     a lunar night.

     Sam sitting before The Old Man doing a few innocuous tasks,
     collecting readouts, slurping a cup of coffee. Gerty is
     within ear shot.                                                 

     Sam sees something that pulls him CLOSER to the monitor.

                          SAM                                         
                Gerty, do you know about this?

     Gerty approaches. Sam taps the screen.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Matthew's got no velocity read-
                out. He's completely still.

                          GERTY (O.S.)                                
                He must have stalled.

     Sam gives Gerty a look. That's not good.

                                                                       31.




65   INT. COMMS ROOM -- LATER                                     65

     Sam is recording a message for Central.

                          SAM
                There's no way to tell from here
                if a track's been thrown, or if
                it's just something jammed in an
                axle, or what... I can shoot out
                there, check it out, get some
                video and maybe save you guys the
                expense of floating in a whole
                crew! I know how tight money is
                right now....

     Sam really frustrated now. He feels cooped up, stir crazy,
     idle.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Just give me the word -- or Gerty
                the word, tell him to unlock the
                exit doors -- and I'll go out and
                get Matthew up and running again.
                    (a beat)
                That's it. Over and out.

     Sam sends the message.

     Sam enters the Rec Room, looks around, his eyes settling on
     the model of the town.

     Sam sits down in front of the model, staring -- he picks up
     the HOUSE he was carving earlier -- studies it carefully.

                                                     CUT TO:

     Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video
     message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,
     examining it as he listens to the video.

     The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the
     screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like
     vultures right now than lizards.

                          THOMPSON
                Sam, we appreciate the offer, but
                you concentrate on feeling
                better.

                                                                       32.

                    (muttering, vexed)
                Oh for Christ's sake...

                          OVERMEYERS
                We don't want you to take any
                unnecessary risks. You're too
                important to us.

                          THOMPSON
                You're to stay put, understand?

                          OVERMEYERS
                It's an order.

                          THOMPSON
                It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.
                Stay put.

                          OVERMEYERS
                We're going to send a Rescue Unit
                to tend to the stalled harvester
                and get the base back on its
                feet.

                             SAM
                       (incensed)
                Why?

     The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as
     good as a kick in the balls.

                          GERTY
                I'm sorry Sam.

     Sam stares at Gerty.

                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Sam, I am under strict orders not
                to let you outside.

     Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at
     the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his
     feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the
     room.

     Sam and Tess making love. We remain very close to their
     bodies in bed. The background a blur. It's the same dream
     we saw earlier.

     Something is different though.                                     

     We drift past Sam and Tess, and under the sheets of the            
     bed.                                                               

     Down between their entwined feet huddles a bearded, wide-          
     eyed Sam, staring directly at us from under the sheets at          
     the end of the bed!

     puttering around in the background. The radio drones away.


71   INT. COMMS ROOM                                              71

     Sam is seated at the Comms Unit watching a message from
     Tess.

     We assume this is an old message since Tess is heavily
     PREGNANT.

     Her slender hands are spread over her prodigious belly as
     she beams at the camera.

                            TESS
                He's kicking...or she's kicking.
                I'm certain he's a boy. I wish
                you could feel it.
                     (a beat, shifting)
                I think we made the right choice,
                Sam. I really do. We need some
                time apart. We got stuck. That
                happens in marriages sometimes.
                It's nothing terrible.
                     (then)
                Well listen, I love you lots --
                and we'll talk soon, okay? Bye
                Sam.

     A POP and Tess is gone -- the monitor filled with STATIC.
     Sam sits staring into space. Tess' message seems to have
     agitated him.

                            SAM
                Fuck it.

                                                                        34.



     He JUMPS from his chair and HEADS OUT of the Comms Room at
     pace.


72   INT. REC ROOM                                                72

     Sam strides in -- swipes a KNIFE from beside the wooden
     model -- strides out again.


73   INT. CORRIDOR                                                73

     Sam glances left and right -- making sure there's no sign
     of Gerty -- then begins to PRY open a VENT with the knife.

     Once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and YANKS
     out a bundle of interwoven WIRES -- Sam bends the wires
     around the BLADE of the knife -- and CUTS.

     GAS ISSUES from the cut wires. An ALARM sounds.

     Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:

                          SAM
                Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!

     Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down
     the corridor.

                          GERTY
                What happened?

                          SAM
                Don't know -- Micro meteorites,
                maybe? Either way there might be
                damage to the exterior shell. I'd
                better go outside and take a
                look.

                          GERTY
                There is no damage to the
                exterior shell.

                          SAM
                It's not that I don't believe
                you, Gerty, but the inner skin is
                springing leaks like an ACME fire
                hose. Maybe you better let me
                take a look, just in case, huh?

                          GERTY
                Sam, I'm not supposed to let you
                go outside.

                          SAM
                Then let's keep it between you
                and me then. Ok?

                                                                          35.



     The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this
     through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects
     at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily
     repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:

                              GERTY
                 Okay, Sam.

     The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam
     this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he
     immediately takes off down the corridor --


74   INT. CHANGING AREA                                            74

     Sam finds his space suit is gone, so grabs the spare suit
     and scrambles into it.


75   INT. DOCK                                                     75

     Two Rovers parked side by side. One of the parking bays is
     EMPTY. Sam stands before the empty bay for a moment -- why
     is one of the Rovers missing?

     If Sam suspected something was wrong before, he is certain
     of it now. He climbs into one of the two remaining Rovers.


76   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                       76

     Sam speeding along in the Rover. He has Matthew's
     coordinates plugged into his Navigation System and is
     following a MAP on a small monitor.


77   EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                       77

     Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes
     apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of
     the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what
     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.

     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with
     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens
     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.

     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam
     takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the
     Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep
     FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.

                                                                       36.




     THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER

     The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the
     accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles
     of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is
     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped
     inside.

     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his
     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching
     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.

     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door
     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --
     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.

     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,
     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam
     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and
     turns the unconscious man onto his back.

     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans
     down even closer.


     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN

     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as
     we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of
     the film.

     Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the
     REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has
     just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.


     WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER

     Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious
     Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him
     to the parked Rover.

                                                     CUT TO:


78   INT. DOCK -- A FEW MINUTES LATER                             78

     Sam drives the Rover into the Dock, flies out and removes
     his space helmet, screaming:

                          SAM
                Gerty! Gerty! Help!

                                                                        37.



     He reaches into the Rover, lifting out the unconscious Sam.
     He carries him in both arms, staggering across the dock --
     back arched, arms beginning to sag -- and into the
     corridor.


79   INT. CORRIDOR                                                79

     Sam promptly collapses and DROPS the unconscious Sam onto
     the floor.

                          SAM
                Gerty!

     Gerty approaches, gliding along his rail. Sam is freaking
     out big time, exhausted, panic-stricken, bewildered.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                I found him outside by the
                stalled harvester. Who is he?
                What the fuck is going on?

     A pause. Gerty literally seems lost for words.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                    (demanding an answer)
                Gerty!

                           GERTY
                We need to get him to the
                Infirmary.

                          SAM
                Not until you tell me who he is!

                          GERTY
                Sam, we need to get him to the
                Infirmary immediately.

     Sam SCOOPS the unconscious Sam up off the ground and lifts
     him towards the INFIRMARY -- staggering -- stumbling --
     going:

                          SAM
                Who is he! Who is he!

     Sounding like some deranged homeless man. Gerty gliding
     alongside him.

                                                      CUT TO:


80   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                        80

     Lying in the Infirmary bed, propped on a pillow, is the
     first Sam, the bearded Sam, who we will now refer to as SAM
     1.

                                                                       38.


     He has a wicked black eye and a purple bruise on the right
     side of his face, looks like he was on the losing end of a
     brawl.

     He has a DRIP stuck in his arm and a tangle of WIRES
     attached to his bare chest. A MACHINE is BEEPING away.

     Gerty hovers over him, redressing the BANDAGE on Sam 1's
     left hand, the one he scolded a while back.


81   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      81

     Sam 1's eyes pop open, he is awake, staring directly at
     Gerty.

                           GERTY
                Hello Sam.
                    (a beat)
                How are you feeling?

                          SAM 1
                Where am I?

                          GERTY
                The Infirmary. You had an
                accident out by one of the
                harvesters. Do you remember?

     For a second this is playing out like the other Infirmary
     scene. A case of deja-vu.

     Sam 1's eyes twitch as he catalogues through his memory.
     Yes he remembers the crash. He remembers something else,
     too.

                          SAM 1
                I saw someone out there, Gerty.

                          GERTY
                Who did you see, Sam?

     Just then Sam 1 notices the other Sam -- the more current,
     clean-shaven Sam -- who we will now refer to as SAM 2. He
     is standing against the wall watching Sam 1.

                          SAM 1
                I saw a girl.

                          GERTY
                You saw a girl out by the
                harvester? How is that possible?

     Sam 1 continues to stare at Sam 2, hardly believing his
     eyes.

                                                                       39.



                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Sam, you suffered a slight
                concussion in the crash and have
                incurred minor injuries, but all
                in all the prognosis is good. I'm
                happy to see you again.

     As he says this Sam 2 crosses slowly from one side of the
     room to the other, never taking his eyes off Sam 1. It's
     like Sam 2 is purposefully keeping his distance, reluctant,
     afraid even, to approach any closer.

     Meanwhile Sam 1 is beginning to look spooked.

                             SAM 1
                Gerty?

                             GERTY
                Yes, Sam?

                          SAM 1
                Is there someone in the room with
                us?

                             GERTY
                Yes.

                             SAM 1
                Who is he?

     But Sam 1 knows exactly who it is. He's seen that face
     every morning of his life in the bathroom mirror.

                          GERTY
                Sam, get some sleep. You're very
                tired.

     Sam 2 wordlessly walks out of the room.

     Sam 1's eyes shift to Gerty, the spooked expression yet to
     leave his face.

                                                     CUT TO:


82   INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY                                         82

     Sam 1 hobbling along, in addition to his facial injuries he
     injured his knee in the crash and is walking with a slight
     LIMP. The camera TRACKING behind Sam 1 as he swings along
     and stops at


83   INT. REC ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                  83

     Sam 1 in the doorway, he peers in.

                                                                       40.



     Seated before the TV watching The Newlywed Game, Sam 2. He
     turns from the TV and shares a LONG LOOK with Sam 1.
     Finally:

                            SAM 1
                Hi.

     Sam 2 just nods. He turns back to the TV.

     Sam 1 continues on down the corridor.


84   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      84

     Gerty is studying lunar rock samples through a microscope.
     Sam 1 enters.

                          SAM 1
                Gerty, what the hell is going on?
                Who is that guy in the Rec Room?
                Where did he come from?
                Why does he look like me?

     Sam 1 is perplexed, but not freaking out, not yet anyway.

                          GERTY
                Sam, you're out of bed.

                          SAM 1
                Yes, Gerty, I'm out of bed.   Who
                is the guy in the rec room?

                            GERTY
                Sam Bell.

     Sam 1 is officially FREAKING OUT now.

                          SAM 1
                Who the fuck is in the rec room,
                Gerty!?

                          GERTY
                You are Sam Bell.

     A long pause. Sam 1 at the point of tears.

                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Sam, what is it? It might help
                to talk about it.

                          SAM 1
                I don't understand what's
                happening, Gerty. I think I may
                be losing my mind.

                                                                       41.



                          GERTY
                We could run some tests.
                    (a beat)
                I haven't reported anything to
                central, Sam. They don't know
                you were recovered alive from the
                accident.

                          SAM 1
                Recovered alive? What do you
                mean? Why haven't you reported
                to central?

                          GERTY
                I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
                I want to help you. Are you
                hungry?

     Sam 1 merely nods at this, turning and plodding out of the
     room, seemingly in a DAZE.


85   INT. CORRIDOR                                                85

     Sam 1 comes out of the Monitoring Station, passes the Rec
     Room without looking in.


86   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS                         86

     Sam 2 has taken over the room. The same belongings, of
     course, but there's a different energy. For one thing it's
     very untidy; looks like the bedroom of an unruly teenager.

     Sam 1 stands in the doorway, taking it in.

     Wordlessly Sam 1 begins to tidy the room. He seems almost
     RELIEVED to be able to lose himself temporarily in this
     physical activity -- making the bed, folding clothes, etc.

                                                     CUT TO:


87   INT. REC ROOM                                                87

     Sam 2 has stopped watching TV and is now seated at a table
     playing solitaire. Sam 1 appears in the doorway.

     Sam 2 looks up. The energy bristling with tension.

                          SAM 1
                You're Sam Bell.

     Sam 2 doesn't answer, goes back to his cards.

     Sam 1 enters with CAUTION, takes a seat across the room,
     purposefully keeping his distance.

                                                                  42.



                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           I'm Sam Bell, too.

                      SAM 2
           Yeah.

Sam 1 nods. A beat.

                     SAM 1
           This is fucked up.

                     SAM 2
           Completely.

Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to
put together a coherent thought.

                     SAM 1
           Why... What are you?

For a second we don't think Sam 2 is going to respond.
Then:

                     SAM 2
           I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking
           clone.

                     SAM 1
           How long have you been here?

                     SAM 2
           About a week.

A beat.

                     SAM 1
           How are you getting on?

                      SAM 2
               (repeating the question
                slowly)
           How am I getting on?
               (then)
           The company ordered Gerty to lock
           all the exits. I haven't been
           able to do anything for seven
           days but sit on my ass.

                     SAM 1
           They locked all the exits? What
           about the harvesters?

                     SAM 2
           Slowed them down to half speed,
           apparently.
                     (MORE)

                                                                       43.

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                And then when I finally trick
                Gerty into letting me outside I
                find a clone of myself in a
                crashed rover. How am I getting
                on? Oh I'm loving it.

                          SAM 1
                I'm not a clone.

                           SAM 2
                Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone.

                          SAM 1
                You're the clone.

                                                     CUT TO:


88   INT. GREENHOUSE - LATER                                      88

     The two Sam's are inspecting plants.

                          SAM 2
                How long have you been here?

                          SAM 1
                Almost three years.

                          SAM 2
                Hence the Captain's beard.

                          SAM 1
                    (with a smile)
                Right.

                          SAM 2
                I didn't know it could get so
                thick. Does it itch?

                          SAM 1
                No, not really.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                Listen, I wanted to say thank-
                you. If it wasn't for you I'd
                still be out there in the crashed
                rover. You saved my life.
                    (then)
                Will you shake my hand?

     Sam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile
     Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished.

                          SAM 2
                    (self-conscious)
                What?

                                                                       44.



                           SAM 1
                 You look just like me. It's
                 incredible.

                           SAM 2
                 Why do I look like you? Why don't
                 you look like me?

                           SAM 1
                 We look like each other, I guess.

     This final line intended as a kind of truce.

                                                     CUT TO:


89   INT. REC ROOM -- LATER                                       89

     Sam 1 and Sam 2 are folding the Ping-Pong table down so
     they can have a real game.


     PING-PONG

     The two Sams playing Ping-Pong. It's slightly competitive,
     but mainly they are just happy to take their minds off
     their situation for half an hour.

                           SAM 1
                 Your serve.

                           SAM 2
                 Score?

                           SAM 1
                 Two points to eighteen.

                           SAM 2                                        
                 Fuck!                                                  

     Sam 2 slaps his paddle on his thigh, his temper creeping up        
     on him. He catches Sam's eye. Gets a grip. Sam 1 is a              
     better player than Sam 2. He's been up here longer. He's
     had more practice.


90   INT. REC ROOM -- LATER                                       90

     After the game, the two Sams are sprawled in their seats,
     sweaty, flushed, energized. They sit before the model of
     the town.

                           SAM 2
                 How long did it take you to do
                 this?

                                                                  45.



                     SAM 1
           I don't remember doing all of it.
           I remember when I did the church
           and the Salvation Army. And a few
           of the people. My mind's been
           acting kind of weird lately,
           though.

                     SAM 2
           It's Fairfield, right?
               (pointing)
           There's Town Hall.

                     SAM 1
           Uh-huh. You know Fairfield?
               (also pointing)
           That's the Baskin&Robbins. And
           there's Tess and Eve. Do you know
           Tess?

The mention of their wife has stopped the conversation in
its tracks. Sam 2 immediately drops into deep melancholy.

                      SAM 2
           Yes.   I know Tess.

                     SAM 1
           You know about Eve, right?

It is obvious from Sam 2's expression that he doesn't.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           We had a girl.

                       SAM 2
           We did?
                (beat)
           She thought she was going to have
           a boy. She was so sure.
                (then)
           Eve?

Sam 1 nods.

                      SAM 1
           She's beautiful. She's really
           beautiful.

                     SAM 2
           How much did she weigh? Isn't
           that what you're supposed to ask,
           how much did she weigh?

                     SAM 1
           Nine pounds, eleven ounces.

                                                                         46.



     Sam 2 doesn't know what to do with the news: on the one
     hand he is jubilant, on the other he's a clone, the baby
     technically isn't even his.

     All of a sudden there is a "PING!" From the Intercom
     speaker:

                          GERTY'S VOICE
                Sam, a message has arrived from
                Central.

     Sam 1 and Sam 2 share a look, then together SPRING from
     their chairs.

                                                     CUT TO:


91   INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                       91

     Sam 1 and Sam 2 seated before the Comms Unit. Sam 1 hits
     the "Play" button. Overmeyers and Thompson appear on the
     screen.

                          OVERMEYERS
                Greetings, Sam!

                          THOMPSON
                How's our Man? Feeling better?

                          OVERMEYERS
                You getting lots of rest?

                          THOMPSON
                Yeah, you resting up, Sam? You'd
                better be you bastard.

                          OVERMEYERS
                Enjoy it while it lasts! We've
                got good news.

                          THOMPSON
                The Jupiter Program had to be put
                on hiatus, so we've got a few
                free pairs of hands --

                          OVERMEYERS
                We've managed to secure you a
                Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.

                          THOMPSON
                Rescue Unit Eliza.

     A SHOT/STILL PHOTO of Rescue Unit ELIZA. A meaner group of
     sons-of-bitches you have never seen. These guys make the
     rescue team from Apocalypse Now look like The New Kids on
     the Block.

                                                                  47.



                     OVERMEYERS
           They've been stationed on Goliath
           19 for the last couple of months.

                     THOMPSON (O.S.)
           Eliza's been in transit for the
           last day....we expect them to
           reach you in approximately 14
           hours.

                     OVERMEYERS (O.S.)
           Commence to jump for joy!

                     THOMPSON (O.S.)
           You'll be back to work in no
           time.

Now back on Overmeyers and Thompson.

                     OVERMEYERS
           Eliza is bringing you something
           special, Sam. Compliments of the
           company.

                       THOMPSON
           A hooker!

                     OVERMEYERS
           No not a hooker. What's wrong
           with you? It's a little something
           to drink, Sam, that's all, our
           way of patting you on the back
           for all that you've been through.

                     THOMPSON
           In the meantime, keep resting up,
           and hang in there.

                     OVERMEYERS
           Yeah you hang in there, Sam. Over
           and out.

And the screen pops to black. A pause.

For a moment there is silence, neither of the Sams knowing
how to react -- going by the message Thompson and
Overmeyers don't know anything about there being two Sams
on the base now.

                     SAM 1
           They're sending a Rescue Unit?
           Why?

                     SAM 2
           To fix the stalled harvester.
           They didn't think I was up to it.

                                                                        48.



                          SAM 1
                Then I'm going back.

     Sam 2 gives Sam 1 a perplexed look.

                          SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                I've done my three years. That's
                it for me --

     Sam 2 is shaking his head slowly.

                          SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                What?

                          SAM 2
                Is that what you really think?

                          SAM 1
                I've got a contract --

                           SAM 2
                You're a fucking clone! You don't
                have shit!

      At once Sam 1 and Sam 2 ROCKET to their feet -- right in
      each others faces, on the BRINK of BLOWS.

                          SAM 1
                I'm going home!

                          SAM 2
                You're not going anywhere!

      Sam 1 turns around, heads out of the room. Sam 2 STORMS
      after him, TALKING the whole time --

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                You've been up here too long,
                man! You've lost the plot!

      Gerty shuttles along after them.


92    INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS                                92

     Sam 1 presses down the corridor, Sam 2 tailing right behind
     him.

                          SAM 2
                What, you think Tess is back home
                waiting for you? What about the
                original Sam?

                          SAM 1
                I'm the original! I'm Sam
                fucking Bell! Me! Me!

                                                                       49.



     Sam 1, stress ball pumping away in his hand, spots Gety and
     angrily faces him.

                          SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                Gerty, am I a clone?

     Gerty doesn't know which way to look.

                            GERTY
                Yes, Sam.

     Sam 1 ducks in the Rec Room, Sam 2 in tow.


93   INT. REC ROOM                                              93

     Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands
     over him.

                          SAM 2
                What about the other clones?

     "Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                Yeah, we might not be the first
                two to be woken up.
                    (indicating the model)
                You said that thing had already
                been started when you got here.
                Well, who started it?
                    (then)
                There might be other clones up
                here right now. Think about it.
                How did I get here so quickly                         
                after your crash? They didn't
                ship me in from Central, there
                wasn't time. I must have come
                from the base.

                          SAM 1
                That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        
                Why would hey do that?                                

                          SAM 2
                I bet there's some kind of secret
                room --

                          SAM 1
                    (laughing)
                Secret room?

                          SAM 2
                Yeah, secret room, why not?

                                                                       50.



                          SAM 1                                       
                    (losing his cool)                                 
                You're the one who's lost the
                plot! I've been here for three
                years. I know every inch of this
                base. I know how many dust fibres
                are between those wall panels
                over there -- why would they do                       
                that?!                                                

                          SAM 2                                       
                Look. It's a company, right?                          
                They have investors, shareholders                     
                -- shit like that. What's                             
                cheaper? Spending time and money                      
                training new personnel or just                        
                have a couple of spares here to                       
                do the job. If they make it                           
                through their contract, great.                        
                If they don't, hallelujah! No                         
                contract completion fees, no                          
                retirement package. Just thaw out                     
                the spare, and keep the profits                       
                rolling in. It's the far side of                      
                the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       
                haven't even fixed our                                
                communications satellite.                             

                          SAM 1                                       
                Tess would know.                                      

                          SAM 2                                       
                Do you really think they give a                       
                shit about us? They're laughing                       
                all the way to the bank!                              

                          SAM 1                                       
                Tess would know what's going on!                      
                She wouldn't let that happen!                         

                          SAM 2                                       
                    (exhasperated)                                    
                There's some area we don't know                       
                about. I'm going to find it.                          

     Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden
     house, starts whittling.

     Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.


94   INT. MONITORING STATION -- QUICK CUTS                      94

     Sam 2 in the Monitoring Station checking wall panels,
     reaching his hand inside cubbies and feeling around deep
     inside, SEARCHING.

                                                                       51.




95   INT. CORRIDOR -- QUICK CUTS                                  95

     Sam 2 moving along the corridor, pressing his ear against
     panels, tapping with his finger --


96   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- QUICK CUTS                         96

     Sam 2 RAMPAGES through the Sleeping Quarters, pushes the
     bed aside, lifts the mattress, goes tearing through a
     closet, ripping clothes from hangers, checks the back
     panel.


97   INT. REC ROOM                                                97

     Sam 2 has come full circle. He shifts the ping pong table,
     goes through cabinets in the kitchen, feels inside --

     Sam 1 half-whittling, half-watching.

                          SAM 1
                I told you.

                           SAM 2
                Shut-up!

     Finally Sam 2 arrives before the model.

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                Get out of the way.

                           SAM 1
                Why?

                          SAM 2
                I want to check underneath there.

                          SAM 1
                You're not moving the model.

                          SAM 2
                Get the fuck out of my way!

     Sam 1 stands, keeps his ground.

                           SAM 1
                No.

     Sam 1 is still holding the knife. Though he's not about to
     use it, both Sams are aware that it's there.

     Suddenly Sam 2 LUNGES for the knife; an INTENSE STRUGGLE
     ensues -- TEETH CLENCHED, sputtering BREATHS -- the two
     Sams less clones right now than ANIMALS.

                                                                          52.



     Sam 2 is able to loosen Sam 1's grip on the knife --
     flinging the weapon across the room -- and SWINGS Sam 1 up
     against the wall.

     Now Sam 2 turns to face the model. Using BOTH HANDS he
     lifts the model up HIGH over his HEAD and PUSHES the entire
     thing UPSIDE DOWN. A massive CRASH.

     There is nothing there but the bare table.

     Sam 1 comes up behind Sam 2 with his nose SPEWING BLOOD,
     wraps both arms around Sam 2's neck. Sam 2 elbows him in
     the ribs -- a quick, controlled jab -- SPINS around,
     manages to secure Sam 1 in an arm lock.

     But suddenly there is no struggle coming from Sam 1: he's
     stopped fighting. Sam 2 removes him from the headlock --
     notices his arm is SMUDGED with Sam 1's BLOOD --

                            SAM 2
                You okay?

     Sam 1 has remained bent over, like he's cast in stone,
     blood RAINING from his face and POOLING at his feet thick
     and fast.

     Sam 2 just staring, as freaked as he is baffled.

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                I hardly touched you.

     Now he tries to help Sam 1.

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                Let me see.

     Sam 1 tears away from him. He looks up, his face a MESS of
     blood -- the WHITES of his eyes unnaturally bright, shouts:

                          SAM 1
                Get off me!

     Sam 1 holds his face with his outstretched hand, as if
     holding it in place -- STUMBLES from the room -- leaking
     BLOOD the whole way.

     A concerned Sam 2 watches him go.

                                                        CUT TO:


98   INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER                                98

     Sam 1 spills in and locks the door. He RAPIDLY turns on the
     faucet and cups his hand to transfer water up to his face --
     this going on for a few seconds.

                                                                        53.




      MIRROR

      Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror, holding a
      MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE. The blood flow has
      subsided

      Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a
      hell of a FRIGHT.

      The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral
      expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers
      the toilet paper from his nose.

                             SAM 1
                   Who are you?

      No answer.

                             SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                       (shouting)
                   Who are you!

      Sam 1 swings around to confront the Girl...but she's not
      there, she's vanished. Her reflection has vanished from the
      mirror also.

                                                      CUT TO:


99    INT. REC ROOM                                                99

      Sam 2 snaps on the TV with the remote, starts watching
      Laugh-In, turns, sees Sam 1 wander by in the corridor. Sam
      2 considers calling out to him, opts against it, gives the
      TV his full attention.


100   INT. MONITORING STATION                                    100

      Gerty is stationed at the Old Man collecting data. Sam 1
      enters.

                                GERTY
                   Hello Sam.

                                SAM 1
                   Hi Gerty.

      Sam 1 sits. A pause. Gerty turns from the monitor, faces of
      with an EXHAUSTED and DRAINED Sam 1.

                             GERTY
                   Sam, is everything okay?

                                                            54.



                     SAM 1
           We had a fight. Me and the other
           guy, the other Sam. We had a
           fight, Gerty. He's a maniac. You
           know what he did? He flipped the
           entire model over. Do you know
           how much work I've put into that
           thing?

                        GERTY
           938 hours.

                      SAM 1
           938 hours, exactly.
               (then)
           Really? 938 hours.

                     GERTY
           Approximately.

                     SAM 1
               (a beat)
           He scares me, Gerty.

                     GERTY
           What is it about Sam that scares
           you?

                     SAM 1
           He flies off the handle. I see it
           now...I see what Tess was talking
           about.
               (a beat)
           I've never told you this, Gerty,
           but she left me. Tess left me.
           For six months. She moved back in
           with her parents.

                        GERTY
           I know.

                      SAM 1
           Oh...
               (beat)
           It was the year before I came in
           here. She gave me a second
           chance. I promised her I'd
           change.

                     GERTY
           You have changed, Sam.

                     SAM 1
           Yeah, I guess I have.

A beat.

                                                            55.



                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           Gerty, since I've been up here
           I've sent Tess over a hundred
           video messages. Where did those
           messages go? Did they ever reach
           her?

A pause.

                     GERTY
           Sam, I can only account for what
           occurs on the base.

                     SAM 1
           What about the messages she sent
           to me?

A long pause. Finally Gerty repeats:

                     GERTY
           Sam, I can only account for what
           occurs on the base.

                     SAM 1
           Gerty, am I really a clone?

                     GERTY
           Sam, when you first arrived at
           Selene, there was a small crash.
           You woke up in the infirmary. You
           suffered minor brain damage and
           memory loss. I kept you under
           observation and ran some tests.

                     SAM 1
           I remember.

                     GERTY
           Sam, there was no crash. You
           were being awakened.
               (a beat)
           It is standard procedure for all
           new clones to be given tests to
           establish mental stability and
           general physical health. Genetic
           abnormalities and minor
           duplication errors in the DNA can
           have considerable impact--

                       SAM 1
           And Tess?    Eve?

                     GERTY
           They are memory implants, Sam.
           I'm very sorry.

                                                                           56.



      Sam 1 nods at this. He's broken-hearted.   He begins to
      leave.

                           GERTY (CONT'D)
                 Sam, it's been several hours
                 since your last meal. Can I
                 prepare you something?

                           SAM 1
                 No thanks, Gerty.

      Sam 1 exits.

                                                         CUT TO:


101   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                        101

      Sam 1 enters the sleeping quarters -- straightens the bed
      and lies down. He picks up the picture of the pregnant
      TESS, stares at it long and hard.

                                                         CUT TO:


102   INT. REC ROOM   -- LATER                                      102

      The TV is off. Sam 2 is sitting, arms folded, entrenched in
      GLOOM.

      Sam 1 enters and heads for the kitchen, prepares himself a
      snack. Sam 2 is aware that Sam 1 is there, but keeps his
      eyes focussed forward, as immobile as a statue.

      Eventually Sam 1 tentatively comes over.

                             SAM 1
                 You okay?

                           SAM 2
                 I'm staring into space.
                     (points to the window)
                 Get it?

      Sam 1 does get it. He smiles to be polite, sits.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 How's the nose?

                             SAM 1
                 Better.

      A beat.

                           SAM 2
                 Listen, I went haywire before. I
                 lost it. I'm sorry.

                                                            57.



                        SAM 1
           It's okay.

                      SAM 2
           No it's not okay. I fucked up
           Fairfield -- your model -- that's
           unacceptable. I don't know what's
           wrong with me.
               (then)
           I've got a temper. I need to do
           something about it.

                     SAM 1
           Yes you do.

A pause.

                     SAM 2
           I've been thinking. That Rescue
           Unit -- Eliza -- they'll be here
           in less than fourteen hours. I
           don't know about you but I'd like
           to figure out where we stand
           before they get here.

                     SAM 1
           Absolutely.

                      SAM 2
           Ostensibly they're coming to deal
           with the stalled harvester. We
           both know that isn't true.
               (then)
           They're coming to dig your body
           out of that rover. They think
           you're in there.

                        SAM 1
           Right.

                     SAM 2
           What'll their reaction be when
           they find out you survived the
           crash? I wasn't supposed to find
           you. Lunar instructed Gerty to
           lock me inside the base for
           Christ's sake.

A pause. Sam 1 thinking it over.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           And there's something else.
           Something I haven't told you.
               (a beat)
                     (MORE)

                                                                    58.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Right around the time I was
           awakened...I walked in on Gerty
           talking to Central. He was having
           a live conversation.

                     SAM 1
           A live conversation?

                      SAM 2
           Yeah.

                     SAM 1
           That's not possible.

                     SAM 2
           No no no, it is possible. It's
           possible because I saw it, that's
           my point.

Sam 2 feels himself losing his temper a little here. He
reigns himself in.

                     SAM 1
           How do you know the conversation
           was live?

                     SAM 2
           It was a back and forth exchange.
           And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers
           up on the monitor. I was supposed
           to be asleep in the Infirmary.
           The moment I walked into the
           comms room Gerty terminated the
           transmission. Now I was a little
           drugged up, granted, but I didn't
           imagine it.

                     SAM 1
           The communications equipment is
           damaged -- there was a solar
           storm --

                      SAM 2
           Tabitha.

                     SAM 1
           Tabitha, right.

                     SAM 2
           Lunar made it up. Maybe. I don't
           know. Bottom line is they don't
           want us to be able to contact
           Earth. Otherwise why would they
           have lied to us?

A pause. Sam 1 staring forward, concentrating. Sam 2
concentrating on Sam 1.

                                                                           59.



                           SAM 1
                 How are they blocking the live
                 feed? The base's communications
                 equipment works fine --

                           SAM 2
                 Maybe they're not blocking the
                 signal from inside the base.

                           SAM 1
                 From where then?

      As if reading each others minds, the two Sams' heads turn
      to the window -- a slow, perfectly synchronized movement.

      The lunar landscape, as black and vast as ever. The view
      almost cruel in its emptiness. It's not giving them any
      answers, not yet.

                                                        CUT TO:


103   I/E. ROVER ONE/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                            103

      Sam 1 speeding along in one of the Rovers. He wears his
      space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver -- shifts
      up a gear, the vehicle flirting with peak speed.

      He flies past one of the Harvesters, speaks through a
      microphone inside his helmet.

                           SAM 1
                 Just passing the last of the
                 Harvesters -- looks like John --

      All of this against the ROAR of the Rover's engine.


104   I/E. ROVER TWO/MOON SURFACE                                   104

      Driving away from base in a   different direction, Sam 2. He
      also wears a space suit. He   also guns the engine. He also
      has a microphone inside his   helmet. The two clones are able
      to talk back and forth with   no delay.

                           SAM 2
                 How long until you're out of the
                 base's range?

      We INTERCUT between the two Sams in their Rovers.

                           SAM 1
                 If I maintain this speed...a
                 minute. Ninety seconds tops.

                           SAM 2
                 You ever been this far out?

                                                                         60.



                              SAM 1
                 No, never.


      ANOTHER ANGLE -- SECOND ROVER

      Viewed from far away, the Rover's speed less impressive
      from a distance.


105   I/E. ROVER'S ONE AND TWO/MOON SURFACE -- INTERCUT           105

      As the Sams continue to drive.

                           SAM 1
                 You see anything yet?

                           SAM 2
                 Nothing. You?

                            SAM 1
                 There isn't shit out here...I
                 feel like I'm about to drive off
                 the end of the world.
                     (then)
                 It would help if I knew what I
                 was looking for.

      Through the glass of Sam 1's helmet we see his FACE
      suddenly SHIFT.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 Wait a second, wait a second.

      Sam 1 squints and leans closer towards the windshield, like
      he's trying to decipher a road sign --

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 I see something.


      SAM 1'S POV

      About a hundred feet away -- appearing from thin air -- a
      massive metal pole stretches up into the black sky.

                           SAM 2
                 What is it?

                           SAM 1
                 Don't know yet.

      Sam 1 getting closer.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 Looks like some kind of antenna.

                                                                  61.



                      SAM 2
           Antenna? Really?
               (then)
           Hang on, looks like there's one
           on this side too.

Sam 2 is indeed approaching something similar.

Sam 1 stops his Rover about twenty feet from the Jammer. He
opens the Rover's door and steps out to take a closer look.


WIDE SHOT -- SAM 1/ROVER

Taking in the Jammer and the adjacent Rover. Sam 1 loping
towards the Jammer, seemingly in slow motion.

The JAMMER is GIGANTIC --An intimidating, stark pole
stabbed into the lunar landscape, like the worlds biggest
caber. Next to it Sam 1 is tiny, a white dot, as
insignificant as a pin prick.

Sam 1 and Sam 2

We cut back and forth between the two Sams as they both
investigate the separate but identical-looking Jammers.

                      SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           I can just make out the top. Must
           be a hundred feet tall at least.
           It's huge!

                     SAM 1
           Whoever built these things meant
           business. They weren't fucking
           around.

Their voices ENERGIZED -- they are excited to have made
this discovery -- they aren't dealing with the negatives
yet.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           What do you think?

                     SAM 2
           Its not an antennae, dude. Its a
           jammer.
               (looking around)
           No wonder we can't get a live
           feed. These things must be
           blocking our signal.

Suddenly Sam 1 doubles over. He vomits thick, viscous
blood and sick into his helmet. Revolting.

The noise is AUDIBLE over the microphone.

                                                                         62.



                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                  You okay?

      No answer from Sam 1. He COLLAPSES backwards onto the
      ground. His chest LURCHES like he's been punched at from
      the inside -- he spins over onto his front --

                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                  Sam?

      Sam 1 manages to climb to his feet -- heads slowly back to
      the Rover -- he dips in, closes the door.

                            SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                  Sam, can you hear me?

                             SAM 1
                  Yeah, I hear you.
                      (then)
                  I'm going to head back to base.
                  I'm not feeling too good.

                            SAM 2
                  I'll stay out here a little
                  longer. I want to see if there
                  are any more of these things.

      Sam 1 pulls a U-turn and begins his journey back to base.

      Sam 2 remains out by his Jammer, investigating further.

                                                      CUT TO:


106   I/E. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                             106

      Sam 1 at the wheel. He has pulled his helmet off within
      the safe pocket of the rovers cabin. He's a grizzly mess
      of splashed sick and blood all over his face and chest.

      Sam 1 screams out with confusion, frustration, terror.

                              SAM 1
                  Fuck!

      He seizes the steering wheel, shakes it FIERCELY --
      beginning to really LOSE IT --


107   INT. DOCK                                                   107

      Sam 1 drives his Rover into the Dock -- not with his
      customary precision -- parks at an angle, grazes the wall.

      The Rover's door JERKS opens and Sam 1 steps out
      unsteadily, his face visibly PALE through the glass of his
      helmet.

                                                                           63.



      He STAGGERS across the dock -- doesn't even close the
      Rover's door behind him -- heads into the corridor.


108   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 108

      Sam 1 goes swerving up the corridor like a drunkard --
      BANGING into walls -- he finally reaches the bathroom and
      ducks in --


109   INT. BATHROOM                                                 109

      Sam 1 sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl. With great
      effort he is able to remove his helmet, placing it on the
      floor next to him. He stares into the toilet.

      For a moment all is calm. The gentle "ping-ping-ping" of a
      computer somewhere inside the base. Sam breathing steadily.
      Spots of sweat on his upper lip.

      And then he VOMITS. He vomits LOUD, he vomits VIOLENTLY.
      His whole body THRUSTS forward in the process, taught,
      tense, like a dog being YANKED on a CHAIN.

      Sam 1 vomits again. And again. And again. And stops.


      ANGLE FROM ABOVE -- SAM 1

      Sam 1's vomit is DARK RED -- he's thrown up BLOOD -- but
      that's not all -- we can clearly see two or three TEETH
      floating in the vomit --


      THE MIRROR

      Sam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide
      to look for the missing teeth -- he uses his thumbs, shows
      his gums -- revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of
      teeth.

      He flushes the toilet.

                                                      CUT TO:


110   EXT. MOON -- DAY                                              110

      Sam 2 driving along in his Rover. He comes across another
      one of these JAMMERS. He drives right up, ducks down,
      peering up through the windshield -- this new Jammer is as
      tall as the others, in fact, it is identical in every way.

      How many of these things are there?

                                                                           64.



      Sam 2 circles the Jammer in the Rover, drives on.

                                                        CUT TO:


111   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       111

      Sam 1 enters and sits down at The Old Man. Frantically he
      starts typing in numbers.

      An array of Log Entries appear ON THE SCREEN. Sam watches
      one of them.

                           SAM 1
                     (on screen)
                 January 12th, Lunar hour 8:32.
                 All Harvesters running smoothly
                 today. Readouts are as follows:
                 Matthew, 12.7 miles; Mark 11.9
                 miles...

      These are just his log entries. What's he looking for?

      Sam 1 starts scrolling BACK through the log entries, like
      he's REWINDING chapters on a DVD, showing himself at
      various stages of his time on Selene -- his beard
      essentially growing in REVERSE as the messages stretch
      further back -- eventually Sam 1 is clean shaven --

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                     (on the screen)
                 Luke, 12.9 miles; John, 11.1
                 miles...

      Sam 1 keeps typing in numbers.

      ON THE SCREEN: "RESTRICTED. PASSWORD REQUIRED."

      No go.   He tries to hack his way in, but is having no luck.

      One of Gerty's long spindly ARMS slides into the room. Sam
      backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery, but it
      stops within reach of the computer.

      Sam 1 watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the
      password in for him. It leaves the room the way it came
      in.

      Sam 1 continues to go further and further back -- and
      suddenly he POPS up on the screen again -- or is it him? --
      this Sam up on the screen has stubble -- no beard -- and
      looks seriously ILL --

      He is barely able to talk -- in fact he's SLURRING --

                                                                        65.



                           SAM
                     (on screen)
                 ...John, 15.1 miles...sorry, I'm
                 not feeling too hot today -- I'm
                 going to have to continue this
                 later --

      The SEQUENCE becomes a FAST-PACED and NIGHTMARISH MONTAGE --
      continuing to BACKTRACK through the log entries -- showing
      yet more SAMS -- one has a MOUSTACHE -- one has a SHAVED
      HEAD -- one has grown out his hair and has a PONY TAIL,
      we've seen this particular Sam before in an earlier scene.

      But all the Sams have one thing in common: towards the
      latter end of their log entries they all appear to be in
      very bad physical shape --

                            SAM 4
                 ...I've got blood coming out of
                 my nose...

                           SAM 5
                 I don't feel too well, Old Man.

                           SAM 6
                 My hair's falling out...look it.

      Sam 1 searches even DEEPER into the COMPUTER and uncovers
      yet more footage.

      We see the others Sams returning to Earth -- yet they don't
      seem to go anywhere -- when they blast off the RETURN
      VEHICLE remains in its bay --

      Sam 1 views different Sams blasting back to earth in the
      return vehicle -- always with the same result -- the return
      vehicle remaining in its bay, the Sams seemingly VANISHING.

      In one particularly GRAINY SEQUENCE Sam 1 views Gerty
      opening the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and
      beginning to VACUUM what appears to be DUST or DEBRIS --

      Sam 1 understands now that the Return Vehicle is not a
      spacecraft, but some kind of INCINERATOR.


112   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                         112

      Sam 1 heads into the Return Vehicle. Its dominated by the
      cryo pod, used to hold astronauts in a state of cryogenic
      sleep on their way back to Earth. Sam 1 pops open the lid
      and starts frantically searching the chamber for TRACES of
      the previous Sams, eventually finding particles of DUST in
      the cracks --

                                                                        66.



      He closes the lid. A video showing a TECHNICIAN in a white
      lab coat begins to play on a screen aimed at the glass lid
      of the pod. It's mute, but we can hear a tinny version of
      the audio coming from the cryo pod. Sam 1 pushes a button
      on the monitor and we hear the audio properly.

                            TECHNICIAN
                  ...relax and breathe deeply. The
                  cryo pod is designed to put you
                  into a deep sleep for the
                  duration of your three day return
                  journey back to Earth. As you
                  begin to get sleepy, think about
                  the magnificent job you've done,
                  and how proud your family are of
                  what you've accomplished.

      Relaxing music begins to play. After a moment the music
      stops. There is a pause. Then an almighty pulse of light
      from the cryo pod. This is how Sams past have met their
      end. Nuked to ash like microwave meals in the cryo pod.

      Sam 1 inspects the controls of the spacecraft to see if it
      really is a vehicle -- in the process of his search he
      finds himself down on his knees checking out the wiring.

      Suddenly Sam 1's attention is on the floor BENEATH HIM. He
      appears to be kneeling on some kind of PANEL -- like a
      tablet in the return vehicle's floor -- he presses his ear
      against the panel -- KNOCKS --

      The panel sounds HOLLOW.


      CUBBY

      Sam 1 opens a cubby, swipes something similar to a CROW
      BAR, heads out of the frame --


      RETURN VEHICLE

      Back in the Return Vehicle, Sam 1 stands over the panel in
      the floor. He uses the CROW BAR to prize the panel open --
      this takes an extraordinary effort -- the panel eventually
      LIFTING like a manhole cover.

      Sam 1 can't believe his eyes. At the top of the OPEN PANEL,
      leading down into darkness...there's A LADDER.


113   INT. DOCK                                                  113    

      Sam 2 returns from his tour of the perimeter of the base;
      pulls up alongside Sam 1's Rover, having to compensate for
      his clone's poor parking job.

                                                                        67.




114   INT. CORRIDOR                                               114

      Sam 2 exits the Parking Bay and removes his helmet. Down
      the corridor he sees Sam 1 standing outside the Return
      Vehicle: facing him, waiting.

                           SAM 2
                 I saw three more of those
                 jammers. The base is surrounded.
                 I printed out their coordinates --

      Sam 2 begins to remove a piece of paper from his pocket,
      but suddenly stops. He can tell by Sam 1's expression that
      something has happened.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 What? What is it?

                           SAM 1
                 I found your secret room.                               

                                                      CUT TO:


115   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                         115

      Standing over the Open Panel, an anxious Sam 1 and Sam 2
      stare down.

                           SAM 2
                 Who goes first?

      Sam 1 wordlessly takes the lead, crouching slightly to
      seize the ladder and twist his body down into the hole. He
      begins to DESCEND. When he is roughly half way down Sam 2
      follows.


116   INT. LOWER DECK/CHAMBER -- CONTINUOUS                       116

      Sam 1 reaches the bottom of the ladder. He's in a dark
      room, a kind of CHAMBER -- if NASA did crypts, it would
      look like this.                                                    

      The only light source right now is the coming from the
      Return Vehicle up above. Sam 2 hops down beside Sam 1,
      squints into the darkness.

                           SAM 2
                 Is there a light?

      Both Sams FUMBLE along opposing walls -- Sam 1 eventually
      finding a SWITCH, snaps it on.

      An array of overhead fluorescent bulbs begin to STUTTER and
      FLASH before ILLUMINATING the chamber completely --

                                                                  68.



The two Sams can hardly believe their eyes: stretching back
maybe fifty feet are rows and rows of PODS -- like upright
glass coffins -- and standing inside each pod, an as-of-yet
UNAWAKENED CLONE. It's like an ENTIRE ARMY of Sam Bells...

Spooky as hell.

For a few moments Sam 1 and 2 are too stunned to speak.
They walk to the end of the chamber and back again, looking
at each clone one at a time -- all the clones are bare
chested and wear some kind of white cloth to cover their
genitals, like a diaper.

Of course they all look the same, that's why they're
clones, but this piece of scientific wizardry is mind-
boggling to Sam 1 and 2 -- they MARVEL at how each of the
clones is identical in every way, and down to the minutest
of details -- same length of hair, same skin tone, same
fingernails --

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Why are there so many of them?

                     SAM 1
           The cryo pod in the Return
           Vehicle is an incinerator.

Sam 2 reacts with appropriate shock.

                       SAM 2
           What?

                     SAM 1
           We don't go home. We're burned to
           death up there. Then the company
           wakes up a new one. Every three
           years. Like clock work.                             

Sam 2 absorbing this. Then:

                     SAM 2
           How do you know all this?

                      SAM 1                                    
               (beat)                                          
           I hacked into the Old Man.
           Actually, Gerty did. I saw
           footage. You're right, there have
           been other clones before us.

                       SAM 2
           How many?

                       SAM 1
           Enough.                                             

A pause.

                                                                           69.



                           SAM 2
                 If that Rescue Unit finds the two
                 of us awake at the same time,
                 they'll kill us both for sure.

      Sam 1 doesn't respond, he's in his own world.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 What are we going to do?

      All of a sudden Sam 1 makes a beeline for the ladder,
      starts heading back up.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 Where are you going?


117   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MOMENTS LATER                      117

      Sam 1 is digging in drawers, removes some equipment, some
      wires; a radio, a small machine called a VIDEO PHONE,
      referred to as a VP.

      He is watched by Gerty.

                            GERTY
                 Sam, can I help you with
                 something?

                           SAM 1
                 Not now, Gerty, okay?

      Gerty begins to slide out of the room.   Sam calls after             
      him.                                                                 

                            SAM 1 (CONT'D)                                 
                 Gerty? Why did you help me? With                          
                 the password? Doesn't that go                             
                 against your programming or                               
                 something?                                                

                           GERTY                                           
                 Helping you is what I do.                                 

      Gerty leaves.                                                        

      Sam 1 goes on picking up equipment, shoves it all into a
      backpack he swiped from a peg.

      Now Sam 2 appears in the doorway.

                           SAM 2
                 What's going on?

                           SAM 1
                 There's something I've got to do.

                                                                        70.



      Sam 1 brushes by Sam 2 on his way out.


118   INT. DOCK                                                   118

      Sam 1 marches up to his Rover, tosses in the backpack and
      dips inside without his helmet, closes the door and backs
      out into the black day.


119   I/E. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                             119

      Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks
      possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --


      WIDE SHOT

      Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now
      know circle the perimeter of the base.

      Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.
      Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might
      be able to get a signal through to Earth.

      ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and
      starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto
      the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP
      resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but
      nonetheless high-quality screen.

      Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters
      some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He
      is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         
      so he is only sending audio.                                       

      A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.

                            SAM 1
                  Come on...come on...

      Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems
      to have gone through.

      And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.

      Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his
      hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles
      dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.

      The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --
      that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:

                            GIRL
                  Hello?

                                                                     71.



That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to
respond:

                     SAM 1
           Uh, Bell residence?

The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or
two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We
assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on
the Girl's end.

The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,
ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.

                     GIRL
           This is the Bell Residence.

                     SAM 1
           I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between
melancholy and curiosity --

                      GIRL
           I'm sorry, she passed away some
           years ago.

Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged
a paring knife into his belly.

                     SAM 1
           No...no way.

The girl just stares.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           Tess Bell? Are you sure?

                      GIRL
           Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her
           daughter.
               (then)
           Can I help you?

And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes
a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new
revelation.

The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.

Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.

                     SAM 1
           Eve?

Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.

                                                                   72.



                     EVE BELL
           Yes?

A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam
1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.

                      SAM 1
                (overwhelmed)
           Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you
           now?

For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --
but is still pulled in, intrigued.

                      EVE BELL
           I'm fifteen.
               (then)
           Do I know you?

                     SAM 1
           How did mom die, sweetheart?

                     EVE BELL
           Uh...

Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from
the screen and calls to someone in another room:

                     EVE BELL (CONT'D)
           Dad!

And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.

                     SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
           What!

                     EVE BELL
           Dad, there's someone asking about
           mom...

 Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into
 the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     

                     SAM'S VOICE
           Who's asking about mom?


Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.

He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of
nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --
Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

                                                                        73.




120   EXT. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     120

      The Rover viewed from outside. We can't hear a thing. Just
      the endless and unrelenting MOON SILENCE.

      Inside the Rover we are able to make out Sam 1, quivering
      at the wheel as he sobs.

                                                      CUT TO:


121   INT. COMMS ROOM                                             121


      CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

      The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.

      Appearing on The Old Man's monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA:
      ARRIVAL TIME, 12 HOURS and 22 MINUTES."

                                                      CUT TO:


122   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                        122

      Sam 2 is sitting before the model. He's flipped it back
      over and returned it to the table top. Now he is attempting
      to fix some of the demolished pieces. At this moment he's
      gluing the spire back on the church.

      Sam 2 hears a sound from the corridor. Moments later Sam 1
      appears in the doorway wearing the backpack.

      Sam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ILL. His depleting
      health has been evident throughout the film, but now it
      seems to have jumped to a new level.

      He watches Sam 2 for a little while.

                           SAM 1
                 Want me to help?

      Sam 2 shifts over to give Sam 1 the adjacent chair. Sam 1
      walks over, sits down. Together they work on gluing the
      church back together.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 Remember that crazy drunk guy who
                 used to hang out by the church?

                           SAM 2
                 Barbara Streisand?

                                                                  74.



                     SAM 1
               (with a smile)
           He looked like Barbara Streisand.
           We used to hide his Bible when he
           passed out. Drove the guy nuts.

Sam 2 nods, remembering. A pause.

                     SAM 2
           How do you carve these things?

                     SAM 1
           Want me to show you?

Sam 2 nods. Sam 1 picks up a block of wood, grabs an exacto
blade. Demonstrates.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           You need to hold the wood away
           from you. Like this.

                     SAM 2
           You're shaking.

Sam 2 isn't kidding. Though he is carving the block of
wood, Sam 1 can't keep it steady.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Why are you shaking?

                      SAM 1
           Watch what I'm doing.
               (then)
           You watching?

                     SAM 2
           Yeah.

                     SAM 1
           Now you try.

Sam 1 hands the wood and exacto blade to Sam 2.

Sam 2 attempts to whittle. He smiles, a little embarrassed.

                     SAM 2
           I suck.

                     SAM 1
           You'll get the hang of it.
               (a beat)
           You see, that's a little better
           already.

                                                                  75.



Suddenly Sam 1 turns around and has a vicious coughing fit.
It actually seems to propel Sam 1 out of his chair and up
onto his feet. Sam 2 watches with concern. Eventually the
coughing subsides.

                     SAM 2
           What's happening to you?

Sam 1 averts his gaze.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Listen, I realize I've been less
           than cooperative. But I want to
           change that. You and me, we need
           to work together. And that starts
           with not keeping secrets from
           each other.
               (a beat)
           Now what's going on?

Sam 1 tells the truth.

                     SAM 1
           I think I'm dying.

Sam 2 stares back at him.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           There's blood in everything. My
           urine. My vomit. I've got a
           constant headache. Dizzy spells.
               (a beat)
           The same thing happened to the
           other clones. I saw it when I
           hacked into the Old Man. After
           three years they all started to
           get sick. Now it's happening to
           me. Well, it's been happening for
           a while now. A couple of weeks.

                     SAM 2
           What do you think it is?

                      SAM 1
           Maybe we don't live that long.
           Maybe we start to decompose or
           something.

                     SAM 2
           Jesus.

Suddenly Sam 1 closes his eyes -- SWAYS -- looks like he's
going to pass out.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Hey hey hey, you okay?

                                                                        76.



      Sam 2 stands and moves to Sam 1. Holds him up, checks his
      temperature.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you lie down for a
                 while? Take some tranqs. Get
                 some sleep.

                           SAM 1
                     (grim smile)
                 No tranqs. I don't think I would
                 ever wake up again.

      Sam 1 manages a nod.

      Sam 2 hooks his arm around Sam 1's shoulder, helps him from
      the room.


123   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      123

      Sam 2 deposits Sam 1 onto the bed. He removes Sam 1's
      backpack, eases a pillow under his head. Sam 1 is instantly
      asleep. Sam 2 pulls the comforter over him.

      Sam 2 begins to leave the room, sees Sam 1's backpack on
      the floor, the VP sticking out of it. Curious, Sam 2 grabs
      the VP.

      FLASHING on the VP's SCREEN: "Last Transmission: 15:14pm."

                                                      CUT TO:


124   INT. REC ROOM                                               124

      Sam 2 enters the Rec Room and shuts the door. He moves to
      one of the tables and sits down, POPS on the VP.

      ON THE VP MONITOR we begin to re-watch the conversation
      between Eve Bell and Sam 1. Obviously we are only seeing
      Eve's face on the screen, but WE HEAR Sam 1's voice in the
      background.

                           SAM 1 (O.S.)
                 Uh, Bell Residence?

                           EVE
                 This is the Bell residence.

                           SAM 2
                     (commenting as he
                      watches)
                 No you didn't...

                           SAM 1 (O.S.)
                 I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

                                                                           77.



                            EVE
                 I'm sorry, she passed away some
                 years ago.

      Sam 2 and Sam 1 have exactly the same reaction at the same
      time.

               SAM 1 (O.S.)                           SAM 2
      No...no way.                     No...no way.

                           SAM 1 (O.S.)
                 Tess Bell? Are you sure?

                            EVE
                 Uh, yeah, I think so, I'm her
                 daughter.
                     (then)
                 Can I help you?

      I'm her daughter. A couple of days ago Sam 2 didn't know he
      had a daughter, and now he's seeing her as a teenager, a
      young woman. He is stunned.

      Sam 2 continues to watch the message but we

                                                         CUT TO:


125   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- DAY                                 125

      Sam 1 fast asleep. Sam 2 watches him from the doorway.


126   INT. STORAGE CUBBY                                            126

      Gerty is just continuing with his tasks like nothing is
      happening. Right now he's STACKING ready-meals and
      miscellaneous lunar snacks into neat columns.

      Sam 2 walks up.

                           SAM 2
                 Gerty, I need to talk to you.

                           GERTY
                 Of course, Sam, how can I help?

                           SAM 2
                 We found the hidden room. We know
                 about the other clones.

      A long pause. Then:

                           GERTY
                 I don't know of a hidden room.

                                                            78.



                     SAM 2
           The hidden room under the Return
           Vehicle, Gerty. You know what I'm
           talking about. We found it on our
           own. Lunar doesn't know anything
           about it.

A beat.

                     GERTY
           The lower deck is out of bounds
           to awakened clones --

                     SAM 2
           Ordinarily, Gerty, but what with
           there being two of us awake at
           the same time, and what with the
           situation being unprecedented,
           the rules have had to change. Do
           you understand?

                     GERTY
           I understand the situation is
           unprecedented.

                     SAM 2
           Good.
               (a beat)
           Gerty, how long does it take for
           a clone to wake up?

                     GERTY
           A clone is awake the moment his
           pod is opened. But he is not
           fully conscious for several
           hours.

A beat.

                     SAM 2
           Gerty, we need to wake up a new
           clone.

                     GERTY
           I am not permitted to do that,
           Sam.

                     SAM 2
           If we don't wake up another clone
           me and the other Sam will die.
           We'll die, Gerty. Do you
           understand?

                     GERTY
           Yes.

                                                                        79.



                           SAM 2
                 Do you want me and the other Sam
                 to die?

                           GERTY
                 That is the last thing I want.

                           SAM 2
                 Then you have to wake up a new
                 clone. Okay, pal?

      Sam 2 waits for a response. And waits.

                                                      CUT TO:

      CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

      The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.

      Appearing on The Old Man's monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA:
      ARRIVAL TIME, 6 HOURS and 19 MINUTES."

      Sam 1 fast asleep in bed.


129   SAM 1'S DREAM                                              129

      A stretch of green grass dissected by a dirt path. A light
      breeze. Endless blue sky above. No clouds. No visible sun.


130   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                     130

      Back on the sleeping Sam 1. Deep breaths. Eyelids twitching
      slightly.


131   SAM 1'S DREAM -- CONTINUED                                 131

      In the distance, sitting beneath a tree on a blanket, we
      see TESS BELL. She is removing items from a picnic basket.

      Sam enters the frame, his back to the camera. He watches
      his wife for a few moments, maintaining his distance.

      Tess looks up and sees Sam. She lifts her hand, waves.

                                                                        80.




      ON SAM -- IN THE DREAM

      Sam's expression is blank at first, but then he smiles at
      Tess, waves back.


132   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      132

      Sam 1's eyes open slowly. He's awake.

      Was his dream a memory? A premonition? Or was it simply
      made up?


      ANOTHER ANGLE -- SAM 1

      A BLEARY Sam 1 yawns and stretches his arms over his head.
      He reaches across the bed and rips a couple of tissues from
      a box of Kleenex, blows his nose.

      Afterwards he checks the tissues: a thick RED GOO came out
      of his nose, the color and consistency of tomato purée.
      Yeah, gross.

      Sam 1 rolls out of bed, plants his feet on the ground.

      The base seems eerily quiet. Too quiet. Sam 1 stands and
      crosses to the door.


133   INT. CORRIDOR                                               133

      Sam 1 begins to walk left, down towards the Rec Room and
      the Monitoring Station, but hesitates -- he turns the other
      way, towards the Infirmary, heads that way instead.


134   INT. INFIRMARY -- CONTINUOUS                                134

      Lying in one of the Infirmary beds, eyes closed, a NETWORK
      of WIRES attached to his chest...Sam. We don't know which
      Sam it is yet. He is clean shaven. He looks like any one of
      the clones down in the secret chamber; then again he could
      just as easily be Sam 2.

      And that's what Sam 1 naturally assumes as he enters the
      Infirmary and sees him lying there. Sam 1 moves closer,
      curious, until he is standing right at the edge of the bed.

      Sam 1 reaches out his hand to wake him up when there is a
      voice from the doorway behind:

                           SAM 2
                 Don't touch him.

                                                                          81.



      Our suspicions are now confirmed. The Sam in the Infirmary
      bed is a new clone. We will call him SAM 3.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 He's not conscious yet. Gerty and
                 I only woke him up a few hours
                 ago.

      Sam 1 is not even remotely on the same page.

                           SAM 1
                 Why?

      Sam 2 puts his finger to his lips. Then:

                           SAM 2
                 Come to the Rec Room.

      Sam 2 turns and leaves. Sam 1 follows slowly, one or two
      glances at the sleeping clone along the way.


135   INT. REC ROOM                                                135

      We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation
      between Sam 1 and Sam 2.

                           SAM 2
                 When the Rescue Unit arrives
                 they'll expect to find a body in
                 the crashed Rover, right?
                     (a beat)
                 We've got our body.

                           SAM 1
                     (points towards the
                      Infirmary)
                 That guy?

      Sam 2 nods.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 They'll expect to find a dead
                 body in the crashed Rover.

                           SAM 2
                 I know.

                           SAM 1
                     (stunned)
                 You're going to kill him?

                           SAM 2
                 Someone's got to pull the short
                 straw here, better someone who's
                 unconscious than you or me.

                                                                     82.



Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           If we go through with this, I'm
           going to need your help hauling
           him out to the crash site.

                     SAM 1
           What about us? Eliza arrives,
           finds you and me as the welcome
           party --

                     SAM 2
           They're not going to find you and
           me as the welcome party, they're
           going to find me. You're going to
           blast back to Earth before they
           get here in one of the Helium 3
           containers.
               (a beat)
           You're going home.

 Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           You've done your three years. I
           can't expect you to stick around.
           Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

 A beat.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           I saw the message on the VP. Eve
           is beautiful. She looks like her
           mom.

 Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no
 secrets between them now.

 They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.
 Finally:

                     SAM 1
           How do you think she died?

                      SAM 2
           I don't know.
               (then)
           Jane died of cancer. I mean, it
           was in the family. Who knows? Or
           maybe it was an accident? Could
           have been a million things.

                     SAM 1
           I wish I'd been there.

                                                                           83.



                           SAM 2
                 Yeah. Me too.

      The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.


                                                         CUT TO:


136   EXT. MOON BASE -- DAY                                         136

      Shot of Selene from across the lunar plane. The base looks
      almost peaceful. No evidence of the DRAMA going on inside.


137   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 137    

      The two Sams are testing out the CARGO CONTAINER to see if
      their plan is going to work and Sam 1 can actually fit
      inside.

      These containers were designed to carry cannisters of
      Helium 3, not to accommodate human beings.

      Sam 1 looks in increasingly bad shape. Blanket draped
      around his shoulders -- gaunt, bobbing, shivering.

                              SAM 2
                 Go for it.

      Sam 1 hunches and slowly insinuates himself into the
      container -- yes, he fits, but it's tight, like really
      tight -- Sam 1 can anticipate one hell of a stiff neck by
      the time he steps out onto terra firma.

                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 Comfy?

                              SAM 1
                 No.

      Sam 2 chuckles.

                           SAM 2
                 But you fit. That's good. You
                 fit.

      With a HEAVE Sam 2 PULLS Sam 1 from the container.

                                                         CUT TO:


138   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                         138

      Gerty is running tests on the unconscious Sam 3.

                                                                        84.



      Sam 1 and Sam 2 stand on opposite sides of the room. Both
      clones seem uneasy. They can't look at each other. They
      can't look at Sam 3. Their eyes roam every inch of the room
      just about before finally settling on Gerty.

      Regardless of Sam 3 being unconscious, are they really
      going to kill him?

                                                      CUT TO:


139   INT. COMMS ROOM                                            139

      Sam 2 sits at the comms unit recording the message, a smile
      plastered on his face, as WIDE as it is FAKE.

                           SAM 2
                 Sam Bell reporting to Central.
                 19:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 14.
                     (a beat)
                 Evening Overmeyers, evening
                 Thompson! According to the Old
                 Man Rescue Unit Eliza will be
                 here in just over three hours.
                 Not a moment too soon! I never
                 thought I'd say this, but I want
                 to get out there, I want to work.
                 I feel like a kid who's been
                 grounded. Looking forward to
                 Eliza straightening everything
                 out and things getting back to
                 normal around here. Well...that's
                 it. I'll let you know how it
                 goes. Over and out, gentlemen.

      Sam 2 sends the message, his SMILE instantly COLLAPSING. He
      mutters under his breath:

                             SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 Bastards.


140   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- DAY                              140

      Sam 1 is sitting on the edge of his bed holding the
      photograph of the pregnant Tess -- staring with great
      concentration -- almost penetrative -- like he's trying to
      will himself into the photograph.

      We find out what's running through his head, cutting to:


141   SAM 1'S DREAM                                              141

      Sam 1 has gone back to his dream -- or his vision -- of
      Tess sitting on the picnic blanket beneath the tree.

                                                                           85.



      Sam and Tess continue to wave to one another. Sam hasn't
      moved. Tess calls out:

                            TESS
                 Come on!

      Suddenly we hear a voice.

                            SAM 2 (O.S.)
                 Sam?


142   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                        142

      Sam 2 is standing at the door. Sam 1 looks up at him.

                           SAM 2
                 We need to do it. We need to do
                 it now. He'll be conscious any
                 minute.
                     (a beat)
                 We've been putting it off for
                 long enough.

      Sam 1 stares back at Sam 2 with defiance.

                           SAM 1
                 We don't have to do anything. I
                 changed my mind.

      Sam 2 isn't following.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 I'm not going back.
                     (a beat)
                 I'm coughing up blood, I'm as
                 white as a ghost. I look like I
                 belong in a graveyard. I meet Eve
                 now, I'll scare the shit out of
                 her more than anything else.
                 D'you think she'll even come
                 within ten feet of me, the way I
                 look?

                           SAM 2
                 What are you talking about?
                 She's your daughter, man! She's
                 not going to care what you...

                           SAM 1
                     (angry)
                 She's not! She's not... my
                 daughter. At least, I'm not her
                 father. Not to her.


      Sam 2 keeps quiet.

                                                                  86.



                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           I'll put myself in the Rover,
           I'll be the body -- it was me to
           begin with anyway, right? You go
           back to Earth. You go back.
           You're healthy. You've got three
           years ahead of you. You stand a
           much better chance than I do. The
           other guy....Gerty can get him up
           to speed...he can be here to meet
           Eliza when they arrive.

Sam 1 seems to have it all figured out. Although Sam 2
should in some ways be relieved by Sam 1's decision, he
looks closer to distraught.

                     SAM 2
           This is wrong. What are we
           supposed to do? Sit around here
           and wait to die? Fuck that!

                      SAM 1
           I don't know.
               (beat)
           It's what we were designed to do.

Both Sams struggle to hold in their emotions; Sam 1 morose,
Sam 2 angry.

                     SAM 2
           Screw that! I'll go! ...And I'm
           going to find this asshole, Sam
           Bell, and ask him why the hell he
           put us through this shit!

Sam 1 looks concerned.   Sam 2 reads his mind.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           I'll be careful. I'll keep Eve
           out of it. She wont even know I
           exist.

Sam 1 smiles wearily, watching his old self.

                     SAM 1
           You're a good guy, Sam.

                      SAM 2
           I might stop shaving; It suits
           us.
               (beat)
           If all our memories are implants,
           no disrespect, but I think its
           about time I got some of my own,
           as well.

                                                                         87.



                           SAM 1
                 Yeah. You should travel.     I've
                 always wanted to do that.

                           SAM 2
                 I'd like that.

                                                       CUT TO:


143   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                              143

      Driving to the crash site. Sam 2 at the wheel, Sam 1 riding
      shotgun. Both men staring ahead in silence.


      MATTHEW

      Where all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled
      Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it.
      The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater
      shipwreck.

      The Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it
      approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a
      standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester.


144   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    144

      Sam 2 keeps the engine running as Sam 1 takes a handful of
      TRANQUILIZERS one by one, washing down each pill with a
      swig from a bottle of water.

      Afterwards: a long pause. The two Sams sitting side by
      side, staring across the bleak landscape. Neither of them
      wants to say good-bye particularly.

                           SAM 1
                 Tess came in for the interview,
                 remember?

      Sam 2 is nodding away. Of course he remembers.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 She was so beautiful. Even   if she
                 wasn't the best candidate,   I just
                 knew I had to give her the   job. I
                 thought she was so sweet.
                     (a beat)
                 And then it was the end of   the
                 summer.

                            SAM 2
                 She was going back to San
                 Francisco.
                            (MORE)

                                                                        88.

                            SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 You knew you had to take a
                 chance. So you called her.
                 You were terrified and wrote that
                 whole speech for her answer
                 machine --
                     (a beat)
                 But I didn't need it because Tess
                 answered the phone. And I could
                 tell in her voice as we talked,
                 she was thinking...
                 "Why has Sam called me?"
                 "The internship's over, why's he
                 called me at home?"
                 And then I asked her if she was
                 going to Adrian Fiddle's barbecue
                 and...

      Sam 1 has dropped off to sleep. The back and forth exchange
      is now essentially Sam 2's monologue.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 That's when I knew she liked me.
                 Because she didn't want to talk
                 to anyone else! She'd get up, get
                 some potato salad, go to the
                 bathroom, but she'd always come
                 back. And then we kissed. On the
                 steps in front of her apartment
                 building.

      Sam 2 finally turns and looks at Sam 1. Sam 1's head cocked
      to one side, eyes closed.

      Sam 2 lifts the helmet off Sam 1's lap -- carefully lowers
      the helmet onto Sam 1's head.


145   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     145    

      Sam 2 LOPES towards the crashed rover holding Sam 1 in both
      arms like a bride. He places Sam 1 on the ground and PRIZES
      open the rover door -- he slowly slides Sam 1 inside.

      Inside the Rover Sam 1 lies with his head jammed awkwardly
      against the passenger side door. At once he looks peaceful
      and wretchedly uncomfortable.

      Sam 2 can barely bring himself to look at Sam 1. With both
      hands he FORCES the door CLOSED, pivots around and slowly
      BOBS back to his rover.


146   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    146

      Sam 2 driving back to base. He has removed his helmet and
      is brushing tears from his eyes with his glove.

                                                      CUT TO:

147   INT. COMMS ROOM                                            147


      CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

      The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.

      Appearing on The Old Man's monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA:
      ARRIVAL TIME, 1 HOUR and 40 MINUTES."

148   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                    148

      Gerty is continuing to run tests on Sam 3. Sam 2 enters. He
      carries the freighted exhaustion of a man who has just
      completed a long and difficult journey.

                           SAM 2
                 How long before he's conscious,
                 Gerty?

                           GERTY
                 The new clone will be conscious
                 within one hour.

                           SAM 2
                 That's good. That's very good.

                            GERTY
                 Sam?   Where is Sam?

                           SAM 2
                 He's gone home, Gerty.

      Sam 2 leaves.


149   INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                             149

      Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER
      in preparation for his trip back to Earth.

      Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there
      in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.

      Gerty glides in as he works.

                           GERTY
                 Sam, this is not going to work.                        

                           SAM 2
                 What? Why not?                                         

                                                                        90.



      Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon
      snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final
      addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15
      million dollars worth!

                           GERTY
                 If the Rescue Unit examine my
                 memory banks they will discover
                 what has taken place over the
                 last week. As you know I record
                 everything. If they are
                 suspicious, the first thing they
                 will do is search my memory
                 banks, and this would put you in
                 considerable danger.

      Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.
      This is serious. It could ruin everything.

      The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the
      robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.

                           GERTY (CONT'D)
                 I recommend erasing my memory
                 banks. I can reboot myself once
                 you have departed.

                 I'll require your assistance,                          
                 Sam.                                                   

                           SAM 2
                 Sure, just let me finish this.

      Sam 2 continues his work.

      SAM 1'S DREAM

      Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the
      blanket. She looks over at Sam, continuing to wave.

                           TESS
                 Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!

      Sam begins to walk towards Tess.

      Back on Sam 1. The glass of his helmet is beginning to MIST
      with blood. Sam sees a sliver of the sun as he dawns on his
      side of the moon. He closes his eyes for the last time.

                           SAM 2
                 I've set your computer to reboot
                 the second I've blasted off.

                              GERTY
                 Okay, Sam.

                            SAM 2
                 Thanks for all your help, Gerty.
                 I wish I could say I was going to
                 miss you, buddy, but to be
                 honest, I can't wait to get away
                 from here.

                           GERTY
                 I understand, Sam. I hope life
                 is everything you remember it to
                 be.

                           SAM 2
                 Thanks. Are you sure you're                            
                 going to be ok?

                            GERTY
                 Of course. The new Sam and I                           
                 will be back to our programming
                 as soon as I have finished
                 rebooting.

                           SAM 2
                 Gerty, I'm not programmed.

                                                                          92.



      Gerty doesn't respond.    Sam 2 seems troubled.

      Sam 2 leans forward and activates the Memory Erase button.
      Gerty's READOUT SCREEN begins to TWITCH and FLASH with
      RANDOM DATA -- then slowly FADES TO BLACK.

      The Robot has been officially SHUT DOWN.

      Gerty just stands there. Completely still. As lifeless as a
      toy.

      Sam 2 heads out of the room at top speed.

      Sam 2 pauses at the window...looking for Eliza. The Rescue
      Unit is so close Sam 2 might actually be able to pick out
      their spacecraft.

      And he can! It's tiny, but nevertheless it's there -- a
      metallic spacecraft, glinting like a jewel -- and heading
      steadily towards the Moon.

      There isn't a moment to lose. Sam 2 swings around, heads
      for the CARGO CONTAINER.

      We remain inside the Monitoring Station as Sam 2 climbs
      inside the Cargo Container He readies himself. Says a
      little prayer and... he cant do it! Cursing at himself and
      glancing at the time ticking away before Eliza lands, he
      jumps back out of the CARGO CONTAINER and runs back into
      the base.

      He starts to frantically type, altering the PATH of the

      and tears off through the base towards the cargo container.

      begin to TWITCH. His READOUT SCREEN streams with DATA.               

      Gerty's head begins to swivel left and right -- as if he's

      crosses to him.

      robot literally picking up where he left off.

      A beautiful picnic is spread out before them. Tess has

                 What took you so long?

          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is
          a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide
          corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and
          battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at
          the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are
          clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.
                         
          Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling
          the gutters.
                         
          A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully
          eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel
          slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He
          takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the
          turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.
                         
          A child's voice says over the speaker:
                         
           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
           In order to show you how a big symphony
           orchestra is put together, Benjamin
           Britten has written a big piece of music,
           which is made up of smaller pieces that
           show you all the separate parts of the
           orchestra.
                         
          As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their
          bedrooms and down to the landing.
                         
          The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is
          Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer
          shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a
          twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high
          socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is
          Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.
                         
          The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They
          lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their
          fists, listening.
                         
          Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly
          and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the
          cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her
          neck.
                         
          Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She
          raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out
          into the rain.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          A rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside
          with turrets and a widow's walk. A weather vane swings
          creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The
          sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland
          is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window,
          watching.
                         
                         TITLES OVER:
                         
          The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain.
                         
          In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They
          shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat
          grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen.
                         
          In half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a
          tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed
          glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs.
          Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly
          Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair,
          topless, in the kitchen sink.
                         
          In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet
          branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker
          fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field.
          She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry.
                         
          In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The edge of a cliff above a white beach. A rocky peninsula
          curls into the background. Brisk wind rustles the tall grass.
          A fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the
          sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a
          tripod. He wears rubber boots and a parka. He is the
          narrator. He speaks to the camera:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           This is the island of New Penzance.
           Sixteen miles long. Forested with old-
           growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by
           shallow tidal creeks. An important
           seabird habitat. There are no paved roads
           but instead many miles of intersecting
           foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry
           that runs twice daily from Stone Cove.
           The year is 1965. We are on the far edge
           of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the
           ferocious and well-documented storm which
           will strike from the east on the fifth of
           September -- in three day's time.

          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
                         
          A clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched
          in a row. A banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind. It
          reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow
          neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch
          over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye.
                         
          A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges
          through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward.
          He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown
          reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin
          scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side.
          He is Gadge.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Morning, Gadge.
                         
                          GADGE
           Morning, sir.
                         
          Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout
          Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and
          rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an
          army-shovel. He is Deluca.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Deluca. Latrine inspection.
                         
          Deluca stops digging. He pulls on a rope and water runs down
          a chute. It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and
          a small, red flag flips up. Scout Master Ward nods.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Good.
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Scout Master Ward strides away. He stops
          in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a
          stump twisting something in his fingers. He is Roosevelt.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Roosevelt. How's that lanyard coming?
                         
                          ROOSEVELT
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           I don't know. I think I skipped a stitch.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A small, woven, multi-colored cord with a rabbit's foot
          attached to the end of it. It has been braided exceedingly
          badly and is brutally twisted and misshapen.
           4.
                         
                         
          Scout Master Ward studies the lanyard briefly. He looks
          perplexed. He pats Roosevelt on the back gently and does a
          secret handshake with him. Gadge makes a note. Scout Master
          Ward strides away.
                         
          An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the
          tents. It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air,
          and revs away riding a wheelie. Scout Master Ward frowns.
                         
          Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs
          stacked six feet high. A thick-set scout with black hair and
          a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms. He is
          Skotak.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Skotak. What's all this lumber for?
                         
                          SKOTAK
                          (CHEERILY)
           We're building a tree house.
                         
          Skotak points up. Scout Master Ward squints. There is a small
          platform under construction about sixty feet above them. Two
          scouts are sawing something in half on it. Scout Master Ward
          looks astonished.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           That's not a safe altitude.
                         
          Scout Master Ward circles around the trunk while looking up
          at the tree house. He stammers:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Why's it up so high? If somebody falls --
           it's a guaranteed death.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Well, where would you've built it?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (PAUSE)
           Lower!
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Skotak looks sheepish. Scout Master Ward
          strides away. He stops in front of a very small scout with
          tiny eyes poking at an anthill with a stick. He appears to be
          contemplating pouring lighter fluid on it. He is Nickleby.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Nickleby. Spot check.
                         
          Nickleby stands up. He looks extremely disheveled.
           5.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Your socks are down. Your shirt-tails are
           untucked. Your trousers are not properly
           pressed. You are reported for uniform
           violation!
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Nickleby slouches. Scout Master Ward
          strides away. He stops in front of a work-bench covered with
          newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel
          into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a
          metal press. They are Panagle and Izod. A sign on the side of
          the table reads No Smoking. Scout Master Ward hands his
          cigarette to Gadge, who holds it away at arm's length.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           How many rockets you up to, Panagle?
                         
                          PANAGLE
           Sixteen and a half.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (TO GADGE)
           That enough for the Jubilee?
                         
          Gadge shakes his head. Scout Master Ward turns to Izod.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Izod, go fetch another pint of gun-powder
           from the armory shed.
                         
          Izod dashes around the corner. Scout Master Ward strides
          away. He shouts:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Redford! Halt!
                         
          The motorcycle skids to a stop in front of Scout Master Ward,
          engulfing him in a thick cloud of dust. He coughs and waves
          his arms in the air. As the smoke clears, we see that the
          rider is a bronze, all-American-looking boy with blond hair.
          He is Redford. His motorcycle has flames painted on the gas
          tank. He tries to cover for himself:
                         
                          REDFORD
           Safety-test, sir.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (BRISTLING)
           Come again?
                         
                          REDFORD
           The vehicle appears to be in good working
           order. I'm just checking if --
           6.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (ANGRILY)
           Reckless cycling. Second warning. Next
           time, I take away the keys.
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Redford scowls. Scout Master Ward strides
          away. He walks past a scout in a white apron cooking bacon
          over a charcoal grill. He is Chef.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Morning, Chef.
                         
          Chef rings a bell hanging on a post. Scout Master Ward
          arrives at a long picnic table. He sits down and opens a
          magazine called Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover
          of a scout troop crossing a bridge in Indonesia.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The first page. A caption across the top reads Scout Master-
          in-Chief. There is a drawing of a seventy-year-old man on
          horseback. He has silver hair and a moustache. A signature
          below reads Commander Pierce. There is a quotation in large
          text: "An eagle was never hatched from a goose's egg."
                         
          As Scout Master Ward reads, all the scouts begin to join him
          one-by-one. They range in age from twelve to fifteen. They
          unscrew the tops of tin mess-kits and assemble folding
          utensils. The chef brings a tray of scrambled eggs to the
          table. The scouts serve themselves noisily.
                         
          Scout Master Ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal
          cup -- then stops. He looks up from his magazine.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Who's missing?
                         
          Scout Master Ward silently reels off a list of names,
          scanning the troop. He turns and shouts across the camp:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Shakusky! Breakfast!
                         
          Silence. Scout Master Ward calls to Lazy-Eye:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Lazy-Eye.
                         
          Lazy-Eye plays another tattoo. Silence.
                         
          Scout Master Ward closes his magazine. He flicks his
          cigarette into a red bucket labelled Fire. He picks up a
          strip of bacon and chews on it as he rises to his feet and
          walks down the row of smaller tents. The last one is sealed
           7.
                         
                         
          at the front. Scout Master Ward stands with his hands on his
          hips and says:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Shakusky? You in there?
                         
          Scout Master Ward tugs on the tent's flaps. He frowns. He
          says to Gadge:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           It's zipped from the inside.
                         
          The other scouts begin to gather with their tin breakfast
          plates in their hands, watching curiously while they eat.
          Scout Master Ward's voice softens:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Sam?
                         
          Scout Master Ward looks concerned. He produces a wooden-
          handled scout pocket-knife. He unfolds a few blades and
          gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the
          end. He crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap
          at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up
          briskly, unzipping the tent.
                         
          INT. SCOUT TENT. DAY
                         
          The lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and
          pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. There is a foot
          locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it,
          and an empty cot. Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent
          over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot
          locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks
          up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from
          under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns
          suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides
          it aside.
                         
          There is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a
          basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. Scout
          Master Ward looks to his staring troop.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Jiminy Cricket. He flew the coop.
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
                         
          A one-room bungalow with a sign on the door that reads Island
          Police. There is a wood-panelled station wagon parked
          alongside it with roller-lights on the roof and a sheriff's
          office insignia on the door. (This is the only car on the
          island.) A dock stretches from the cottage into a small
           8.
                         
                         
          harbor. There is a launch moored at the end of it which bobs
          in the rough tide.
                         
          A silver Airstream trailer is parked under a tree nearby.
                         
          A six-foot tall, forty-five-year-old man sits on a stool
          fishing from the side of the dock. He wears a short-sleeved
          police uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap. His
          glasses have clear, plastic frames and a strap. He is Captain
          Sharp.
                         
          Two grouchy, leathery, very old men in plaid flannel and
          hunting caps fish alongside Captain Sharp. A speaker on a
          post emits an electric buzz. Captain Sharp turns. He stands
          up briskly and says to one of the old men:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Watch my line, Edgar.
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION. DAY
                         
          A small office with a desk, a file cabinet, and a two-way
          radio. Captain Sharp comes inside, sits down, grabs a
          microphone, and presses a red button on the side of it with
          his thumb.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over.
                         
          Scout Master Ward's voice comes over a crackly speaker:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           Captain Sharp, this is Randall Ward over
           at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.
                         
          Captain Sharp pours himself a cup of coffee from a pot on a
          hot-plate as he answers distractedly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Morning, Randy. What can I do for you?
           Over.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           I'm not sure, exactly. I've got an
           escaped Khaki Scout. Over.
                         
          Silence. Captain Sharp frowns slightly.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What does that mean? Over.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           One of my boys seems to have stolen a dug-
           out and some fishing tackle, ten pounds
                          (MORE)
           9.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
           of sundries, two bedrolls, plus an air
           rifle -- and disappeared. Over.
                         
          Captain Sharp slowly stirs sugar into his coffee as he
          contemplates this. He says finally:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Any idea why? Over.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           No. He left me a letter of resignation.
           Over.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A sheet of wide-ruled yellow paper which reads in a boy's
                         PENCILED SCRAWL:
                         
           Dear Scout Master Ward, I am very sad
           to inform you I can no longer be involved
           with the Khaki Scouts of North America.
           The rest of the troop will probably be
           glad to hear this. It is not your fault.
           Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.
                         
          Captain Sharp scratches his head. He checks his watch. Pause.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I guess we better notify his folks. Over.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           OK. Over and out.
                         
          EXT. POST OFFICE. DAY
                         
          A clapboard cottage surrounded by a white, picket fence. A
          sign on the door reads U.S. Mail. Captain's Sharp station
          wagon is parked in the background.
                         
          INT. POST OFFICE. DAY
                         
          A young woman with her hair in a bun sits at an operator's
          switchboard eating a sandwich wrapped in wax-paper. She is
          Becky. She wears bulky head-phones with a microphone
          attached. Captain Sharp paces behind her. Scout Master Ward
          flips through a stack of letters and post cards.
                         
          A bell rings on the switchboard. Becky plugs cords into
          sockets.
                         
                          BECKY
           Hello, Diane.
           10.
                         
                         
           OPERATOR (V.O.)
           Becky, I have your person-to-person from
           Chesterfield.
                         
                          BECKY
           Hold the line, please.
                         
          Becky signals to Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward. They
          sit down quickly and put on their own sets of operator head-
          phones.
                         
                          BECKY
           Go ahead, Chesterfield.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
          Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a
          seventy-five-year-old man with a grizzled face sitting at a
          kitchen table drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette while a
          white-haired woman ices a cake in the background. They are
          Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. Mr. Billingsley says into his
                         TELEPHONE:
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           Hello?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp.
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank
           you very much. In fact, we've come to a
           decision, as a family, because this is
           only the most recent incident involving
           Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to
           the others, so, unfortunately -- we can't
           invite him back, at this time.
                         
          Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky all look puzzled.
          Captain Sharp says evenly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll
           find him. We're just notifying you as a
           matter of protocol and so on.
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           I understand that. I'm notifying you of
           the situation on my end.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I'm confused by that statement. You can't
           invite him back?
           11.
                         
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           I'm afraid not. He's a good boy, he's got
           a good heart, but it's just not fair to
           the others, you see? He's emotionally
           disturbed.
                         
          Long pause. No one moves except Mrs. Billingsley icing her
          cake. Captain Sharp says finally:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Am I speaking to Sam's father?
                         
          Mr. Billingsley frowns. He says, surprised:
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a
           number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs.
           Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's
           been with us since last June.
                         
          Mrs. Billingsley has stopped icing her cake. She watches Mr.
          Billingsley. Scout Master Ward interjects:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Excuse me, sir. This is Scout Master Ward
           speaking. Are you implying Sam's an
           orphan?
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           Well, it's a known fact. Of course, he
           is.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Why the hell doesn't it say that in the
           register? Excuse my language.
                         
          Scout Master Ward holds up a manila file-card. Mr.
          Billingsley shrugs.
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           I don't know. What register?
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The manila file-card. It is labelled Khaki Scout Register.
          Sam Shakusky is typed across the top line. There is an
          address, health information, and a small, faded snap-shot
          stapled to the corner of it of a twelve-year-old boy standing
          in a sunny tobacco field. He wears his scout uniform with a
          Davy Crockett-style coon-skin cap.
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           We sent him a letter. It should reach you
           presently.
           12.
                         
                         
          Scout Master Ward looks quickly through his stack of letters.
          He stops and pulls out an air-mail envelope. He stares at it.
          Captain Sharp says forcefully but highly agitated:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped
           Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a
           matter of protocol. You say you can't
           invite him back? You say he's an orphan?
           Well, I don't understand how that works.
                          (TOTALLY CONFUSED)
           What am I supposed to do with him?
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           That's up to Social Services. They'll be
           in touch with you. They'll look after
           Sam. Good luck to you.
                         
          Mr. Billingsley hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords
          out of their sockets. Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master
          Ward. Silence.
                         
          Becky opens a tin of home-made chocolate chip cookies.
          Captain Sharp declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He
          looks very impressed.
                         
          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
                         
          Scout Master Ward stands on a bench addressing his assembled
          troop. The scouts are equipped for hiking with back-packs and
          walking-sticks.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You have your orders. Use the
           orienteering and path-finding skills
           you've been practicing all summer. Let's
           find our man and bring him safely back to
           camp. Remember: this isn't just a search
           party, it's a chance to do some first-
           class scouting. Any questions?
                         
          Lazy-Eye raises his hand. Scout Master Ward points to him.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Lazy-Eye.
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           What's your real job, sir?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (CAUGHT OFF-GUARD)
           I'm a math teacher.
           13.
                         
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           What grade?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (STIFFENING)
           Eighth. Why?
                         
          Lazy-Eye shrugs. Scout Master Ward frowns.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You know, we're, actually, kind of, in
           the middle of something, if you didn't
           notice. This is a crisis. Anybody else?
                         
          Redford raises his hand. Scout Master Ward points to him.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Redford.
                         
                          REDFORD
           What if he resists?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (HESITATES)
           Who?
                         
                          REDFORD
           Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on
           him?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (IRRITATED)
           No, you're not. This is a non-violent
           rescue effort. Your instructions are to
           find him, not to hurt him. Under any
           circumstances. Do I make myself
           understood?
                         
          The scouts murmur their understanding. Scout Master Ward
          nods.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Good.
                         
          Pause. Scout Master Ward wheels back to Lazy-Eye:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           I'm going to change my answer, in fact.
           This is my real job. Scout Master, Troop
           55. That's us. I'm proud of that.
                         
          The scouts look impressed but slightly lost. Scout Master
          Ward says finally:
           14.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Be leery out there. OK, let's get
           started. Where's Snoopy?
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Right here.
                         
          Skotak holds up a leash attached to a wire-haired terrier.
          Scout Master Ward takes a sock with a fleur-de-lis on it out

           Give him the scent.
                         
          Scout Master Ward hands the sock to Skotak.

          Redford, Deluca, Nickleby, Lazy-Eye, and Gadge at the back of
          the group talking under their breath while Skotak waves the
          sock under the dog's nose:
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           I heard he ran away because his family
           died.
                         
                          GADGE
           I heard he never had any family in the
           first place.
                         
                          DELUCA
           That's probably why he's crazy.
                         
                          REDFORD
           I'll tell you one thing: if we find him,
           I'm not going to be the one who forgot to
           bring a weapon.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           Me, neither.
                         
                         MONTAGE:
                         
          The troop moves in a wide line searching through a thicket of
          skinny trees. Redford carries a net and a giant tomahawk in a
          sling. Deluca has a large hunting knife tucked under his
          belt. Panagle holds a walking stick with a cluster of nails
          sticking out on the end of it. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye
          all wear bows and quivers of arrows strapped to their backs.
          The wire-haired terrier strains at the end of a leash,
          sniffing down a foot-path.

          Scout Master Ward speeds up the river in a small boat with an
          out-board motor. He gives orders over a walkie-talkie. Gadge
          steers.
                         
          Captain Sharp stands on the doorsteps of various big houses
          showing the snap-shot of the missing scout to: an elderly
          woman, a house-keeper, a group of children, a priest. They
          all shake their heads.
                         
          Captain Sharp drives his station wagon down a beach, through
          a field, and over a bridge.
                         
          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          Captain Sharp stands at the front door talking with Mr. and
          Mrs. Bishop. Mr. Bishop holds a glass of red wine in one hand
          and an open bottle in the other. Mrs. Bishop looks slightly
          uneasy. They both study the snap-shot.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Camp Ivanhoe? That's all the way across
           the other side of the island. You really
           think a twelve-year-old boy could row
           this far in a canoe?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Most likely not.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           (with a shrug)
           It's possible, Counsellor.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (SLIGHTLY IRRITATED)
           I disagree, Counsellor. It'd take him
           three days, at least.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I don't think so. Two days, maximum.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Be that as it may, will you let me know
           if you see anything unusual?
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of Captain Sharp from overhead as he walks
          away down the front steps. He passes Lionel, Murray, and Rudy
          on their way up the path. They wear wet bathing suits and
          towels around their shoulders. Captain Sharp pats Rudy on the
          top of his head. He dries his hand on the leg of his
           16.
                         
                         
          trousers. He gets into his station wagon, backs out of the
          driveway, circles through the woods, and drives around to a
          small dirt road a hundred yards behind the house. He stops
          the car. He gets out, sits on the hood, and lights a
          cigarette.
                         
          Suzy watches from the widow's walk with her binoculars. She
          lowers them. She looks curious. She raises them back to her
          eyes and sees:
                         
          Mrs. Bishop from overhead as she comes out the back door of
          the house carrying a basket of damp laundry. She pauses at a
          clothesline, looks left and right, then walks quickly into
          the trees. She crosses a foot-bridge and arrives at the dirt
          road. Captain Sharp stands up. They talk briefly but
          intensely. Mrs. Bishop leans against the car and stares into
          space. Captain Sharp touches her hair. Mrs. Bishop makes a
          gesture with her fingers. Captain Sharp hands her his
          cigarette. Mrs. Bishop takes a puff, hands it back, and
          strides away again through the woods. Captain Sharp gets into
          his station wagon and drives off.

          A portable night stand. There is a reel-to-reel tape recorder
          recording on it. A framed photograph next to it shows the
          Scout-Master-in-Chief posing with a troop in front of the
          Matterhorn.
                         
          INT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. NIGHT
                         
          The front flaps are tied-open, and a mosquito net is drawn. A
          hanging lantern flickers on a hook. A bugle plays a variation
          of taps in the distance. Scout Master Ward sits on a cot
          dressed in pajamas. He smokes a cigarette and drinks a glass
          of brandy while he speaks tensely into a microphone:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Scout Master's log. September second.
           First day of search party for Sam
           Shakusky. Morale is extremely low, in
           part, I suppose, because Sam is,
           unfortunately, the least popular scout in
           the troop, by a significant margin. I'm
           worried, and I'm confused. Please, let us
           find him tomorrow. Please, don't let him
           fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn
           lake or something. A terrible day at Camp
           Ivanhoe. Let's hope tomorrow's better. In
           fact, I'm going to say a prayer.
                         
          Scout Master Ward presses stop. He kneels down on the floor,
          closes his eyes, presses his palms together, and whispers.

          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. NIGHT
                         
          Scout Master Ward zips up his tent and turns off the light.
          Crickets chirp. Bats circle. The wire-haired terrier digs
          carefully through a pile of trash.
                         
          EXT. NARROW STREAM. DAY
                         
          The next morning. A fast current runs along a shallow ravine
          deep in the forest. The boy from the snap-shot rows a mini-
          canoe painted with Native American tribal symbols and
          severely over-loaded with boxes, bags, and blankets. He wears
          a pellet gun slung on a strap over his shoulder and his coon-
          skin cap. He smokes a pipe. A sash across his chest is
          decorated with numerous small, embroidered patches. There is
          a woman's enamelled brooch pinned to his shirt. It is a
          jeweled, black scorpion. He whistles to himself quietly as he
          steers under a fallen tree-trunk and winds through gentle
          rapids. He is Sam.
                         
          EXT. RIVER BANK. DAY
                         
          An eddy under a willow tree. The end of the canoe is tied to
          a branch, and the cargo is stacked on the shore. Sam covers
          the boat with a camouflage net and dresses the top with pine-
          needles.
                         
          EXT. ROCKY GORGE. DAY
                         
          Sam hikes through a pass wearing an extremely large back-pack
          with stakes, metal poles, and two bed-rolls strapped to the
          bottom. He wears a compass on a string around his neck.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of Sam emerging from the woods into a wide
          meadow. The grass comes up to his chest and flows in waves.
          He pauses to check his compass. He spins slowly one direction
          and then back the other while he stares at the dial. He looks
          up again. He walks onward. He stops.
                         
          EXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY
                         
          Suzy lowers her binoculars. She stands at the end of a path
          cut through the high grass. She has a leather folder in one
          hand, the portable record player in the other, plus a small
          suitcase and her kitten in a basket at her side. Sam takes
          his coon-skin hat slowly off his head. He strides across the
          meadow. Suzy watches him approach. She swallows. Her lips
          part. Sam comes onto the path. He stops ten feet away from
          Suzy.
                         
          Sam and Suzy stare at each other. Silence. (NOTE: Suzy is
          slightly taller than Sam.)

          A poster box with St. Jack's Church across the top. A purple-
          ink mimeographed page is stapled to a bulletin board inside
          under the heading Summer Pageant, 1964. It reads:

          Dusk. A brick church at the top of a bluff overlooking the
          bay. It is overgrown with ivy and wisteria. There is a
          cemetery with a low wrought-iron fence. An organ plays
          inside.

           One Year Earlier
                         
          INT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. EVENING
                         
          A play is in progress. The set includes a long ark with a
          sail built on a platform behind the altar. Two teenagers
          crouched in the wings ripple a narrow, blue sheet across the
          foot of the stage. (This is meant to be water.) The rest of
          the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the
          center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large
          congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the
          walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir
          loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a
          brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next
          cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised.
                         
          Khaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the
          church. A very young troop in a slightly different version of
          the uniform fills a row near the exit. Sam sits on the aisle.
          He looks bored.
                         
          A baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard
          sings ominously on the stage. Cymbals crash. Sam stands up
          and discreetly wanders toward the side door with his hands in
          his pockets. A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform
          watches him from the end of the pew, frowning.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam quietly entering the lobby. The sound of the music
          deadens as he gently shuts the door behind him. He turns
          around and puts on a yellow scout cap with Junior Khaki
          stitched on the bill. The room is jammed with children
          dressed as animals, waiting nervously in a long line that
           19.
                         
                         
          winds all around the space. They whisper and shuffle. A large
          woman stares through a small window into the church with her
          hand on a doorknob. She is Mrs. Lynn. She snaps her fingers
          suddenly without looking to the children. They fall silent.
          Pause.
                         
          Mrs. Lynn swings open the center doors. Music fills the room
          again. The first twenty of the children begin to sing. They
          march out of the lobby, two by two. The woman closes the
          doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to
          wait.
                         
          Sam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and
          skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching
          horns, tusks, and teeth. No one pays attention to him. He
          drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a
          bowl and sucks on it. He slips out through a swinging door.
                         
          INT. DRESSING ROOM. EVENING
                         
          Sam moves down a dark corridor. Voices murmur. He pokes his
          head around a corner. A rack of choir robes and cassocks
          blocks his path. He slides two of them apart and looks
                         THROUGH AT:
                         
          Five eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a
          bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. They talk
          quietly and fix their make-up. They all wear wings on their
          arms and beaks on their heads. Suzy sits among them in black
          feathers. Sam stares at her. He steps into the light
          silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection. The other girls
          turn around quickly, covering themselves.
                         
          Sam removes his cap and takes another step forward. His eyes
          dart briefly among the other girls. He says to Suzy:
                         
                          SAM
           What kind of bird are you?
                         
          Suzy hesitates. She looks to the girl next to her, who says
          in a bossy voice:
                         
                          BOSSY GIRL
           I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and --
                         
          Sam does not look away from Suzy as he interrupts, pointing:
                         
                          SAM
           No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?"
                         
          The other girls all look to Suzy. Pause.
                         
                          SUZY
           I'm a raven.
           20.
                         
                         
          Suzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead. The
          other girls look annoyed but transfixed. The bossy girl
          frowns.
                         
                          BOSSY GIRL
           Boy's aren't allowed in here.
                         
          Sam does not look away from Suzy as he answers quietly:
                         
                          SAM
           I'll be leaving soon.
                         
          Sam points down at Suzy's lap. One of her hands is wrapped in
          a bandage.
                         
                          SAM
           What happened to your hand?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (PAUSE)
           I got hit in the mirror.
                         
                          SAM
                          (TAKEN ABACK)
           Really. How'd that happen?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SHRUGS)
           I lost my temper at myself.
                         
          Sam is deeply intrigued by this. The other girls look
          puzzled. Suzy presses her hair back off her face. She watches
          Sam nervously.
                         
                          SUZY
           What's your name?
                         
                          SAM
           Sam. What's yours?
                         
                          SUZY
           I'm Suzy.
                         
          Sam nods with his eyes still glued to Suzy's. Suzy bites her
          fingernails. The bossy girl rolls her eyes.
                         
                          BOSSY GIRL
           It's not polite to stare.
                         
          Sam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking.
          Mrs. Lynn steps into the doorway.
                         
           MRS. LYNN
           Birds! Ready?
           21.
                         
                         
          Mrs. Lynn does a double-take. She snaps at Sam:
                         
           MRS. LYNN
           Who are you? Where'd you come from? Go
           back to your seat.
                         
          Sam hesitates. He spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out
          through the clothing rack, and is gone. A skinny girl dressed
          as an owl watches Suzy while the other girls hurry to their
          feet. She says quietly:
                         
                          SKINNY GIRL
           He likes you.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH YARD. EVENING
                         
          Troops flood out from one side of the church while children
          in animal costumes flood out from the other. They criss-cross
          among grave-markers and head-stones. Sam stops abruptly, face
          to face with the skinny owl. She whispers something, points
          behind her, and thrusts a folded scrap of paper into Sam's
          hand.
                         
          INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT
                         
          A vehicle crowded with scouts. Sam sits alone in the back
          row. He stares into space, entranced.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Suzy on-stage at the top of a pedestal with her arms in the
          air, spreading her wings. She is surrounded by the entire
          cast of singing animals. The music soars.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam as he looks down at the piece of paper in his hand.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A sheet of pink stationary with an address in a girl's red
          felt-tip cursive and the words:
                         
           Write to me.

          The present. Sam and Suzy face each other in the wide meadow.
          Sam says carefully:
                         
                          SAM
           Were you followed?
           22.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
                          (LOOKING AROUND)
           I doubt it.
                         
                          SAM
           Good.
                         
          Sam frowns and squints. He points.
                         
                          SAM
           Did you bring a cat?
                         
          Suzy nods. Sam smiles. Suzy smiles. Sam takes a folded map
          out of his pocket. He signals for Suzy to come closer.
                         
                          SAM
           Can you read a map?
                         
                          SUZY
           Uh-huh.
                         
                          SAM
           I do cartography.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a
          protractor embroidered on it. He unfolds the map.
                         
                          SAM
           I feel we should go halfway today and
           halfway tomorrow, since you're a less
           experienced hiker, and you're wearing
           Sunday-school shoes.
                         
                          SUZY
           OK.
                         
                          SAM
           (pointing on the map)
           Here's where we are right now. I'd like
           to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred
           (which means four o'clock). How does that
           sound?
                         
                          SUZY
           Fine.
                         
                          SAM
           You want some beef jerky?
                         
                          SUZY
           OK.
                         
          Sam tears a strip of dried meat in two and gives half to
          Suzy. She tries to chew on it. Sam nods:
           23.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Let's go.
                         
                         MONTAGE:
                         
          Sam and Suzy walk together down a hill, across a field, and
          through a wooded path eating beef jerky. They both smile
          continuously.
                         
                          SAM
           Are you thirsty?
                         
                          SUZY
           No.
                         
                          SAM
           Well, if your throat gets parched, stick
           a pebble in your mouth and suck on it.
           You can quench your thirst with the spit,
           supposedly.
                         
          Sam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out
          from under his coonskin cap.
                         
                          SAM
           Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It
           cools your head down.
                         
                          SUZY
           That's a good idea. It might help also if
           you didn't wear fur.
                         
                          SAM
                          (HESITATES)
           True, but this adds camouflage.
                         
          Sam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass. He
          holds it in his fist.
                         
                          SAM
           Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air,
           and you can see which direction the
           wind's blowing.
                         
          Sam throws up the grass. It swirls and drifts vaguely. Suzy
          squints.
                         
                          SUZY
           Which way?
                         
                          SAM
           Unknown. I guess it doesn't really
           matter, as long as we cover our tracks.
           24.
                         
                         
          Sam and Suzy stop to investigate and discuss: a patch of
          mushrooms, moss on a stump, ferns, poison ivy, and a low bush
          with purple fruit. Sam looks skeptical.
                         
                          SAM
           These might be poisonous.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (STUDYING THEM)
           No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try
           one.
                         
          Suzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry. Sam puts one
          into his mouth and nods.
                         
                          SAM
           Not bad. Anyway, they're good for
           survival.
                         
          Sam and Suzy look through Suzy's binoculars at a deer
          drinking from a stream. Suzy whispers:
                         
                          SUZY
           He knows someone's watching him.
                         
                          SAM
           I agree. Why do you say that?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SQUINTING)
           I don't know. I just think he can feel
           us.
                         
          Sam and Suzy walk across a fallen tree over a stream. A snake
          swims on the surface below them. Sam assists Suzy onto the
          far bank.
                         
                          SAM
           You smell like perfume.
                         
                          SUZY
           It's my mother's.
                         
          Sam picks up two pebbles. He and Suzy both put them in their
          mouths. They click against their teeth.
                         
                          SAM
           I brought water, too.
                         
          Sam and Suzy watch a small, green worm wriggling in the air,
          swaying from a silk thread. They stare, wide-eyed. Suzy cups
          her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a
          circle. Sam shrugs.
           25.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Should we catch him?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (HESITATES)
           What for?
                         
                          SAM
           Trout bait. We need worms.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SHARPLY)
           No.
                         
          Pause. The worm curls and uncurls itself gently. Sam nods.
                         
                          SAM
           You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe
           I've got a licorice whip.
                         
          EXT. LAKE SHORE. DAY
                         
          The banks of a large pond. All of Sam's and Suzy's bags,
          boxes, and suitcases are arranged around a small tent
          decorated with more tribal symbols. The kitten is asleep. Sam
          and Suzy stand at the water's edge as he removes the
          camouflage net from the canoe and says gravely:
                         
                          SAM
           How strong of a swimmer are you?
                         
                          SUZY
           Pretty good. I broke our school record
           for the back-stroke.
                         
                          SAM
                          (MILDLY SURPRISED)
           OK. Well, I'm not that strong of a
           swimmer, so I wear a life-preserver. I
           think it's a good policy to get in the
           habit, anyway.
                         
                          SUZY
           OK.
                         
          Sam and Suzy both strap on vests belted with cork blocks.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A strip of bright red licorice on a hook under water.
                         
                         CUT TO:
           26.
                         
                         
          Sam and Suzy in the middle of the lake. Suzy sits at one end
          of the canoe fishing with a bamboo pole. Sam drapes his
          fingers off the side and stirs the water.
                         
                          SAM
           Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you,
           if you put your fingers in their mouths.
           Let me see if I can catch this one.
                         
          Sam dips a net into the lake and brings it up with a small
          turtle in it. He lifts it out of the net. It has red and
          yellow markings and a slightly damaged shell. Sam flips it
          over. The word Albert is written on the underside of the
          turtle in magic marker. Sam says blankly:
                         
                          SAM
           Somebody wrote on him.
                         
          The fishing pole jerks in Suzy's hands. She yells:
                         
                          SUZY
           The stick's moving!
                         
                          SAM
                          (ALERTED)
           You got one!
                         
          Sam jumps to his feet and heaves the turtle with two hands.
          It sails through the air across the pond and splashes down
          with a whack. Sam yells an announcement:
                         
                          SAM
           Fish on hook!
                          (TO SUZY)
           Reel him in! Slowly.
                         
          The canoe rocks violently. Suzy snaps:
                         
                          SUZY
           Sit down!
                         
          Sam sits back down. Suzy winds the reel carefully. Sam says,
                         GENTLY ENCOURAGING:
                         
                          SAM
           You're doing good.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a rod
          and reel embroidered on it.
                         
                          SAM
           This is for fishing.
           27.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE SHORE. DUSK
                         
          Sam twists a stick with a shoelace in kindling and builds a
          small camp-fire circled with rocks. He cooks two fish with
          bologna in a frying pan over a camp-fire. He throws in a dash
          of salt, grinds some pepper, and flips the fish in the air.
          He holds out a bite on a spatula to Suzy sitting on a log
          next to him. She tastes it. She looks surprised and nods
                         ENTHUSIASTICALLY:
                         
                          SUZY
           Very good. You know a lot about camping,
           don't you?
                         
                          SAM
                          (STIFFENING)
           I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained
           for.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has fried
          eggs and bacon on it.
                         
                          SAM
           Anyway, I used to be.
                         
          Sam serves the fish onto two tin plates. He says as they eat
          with folding forks:
                         
                          SAM
           We can feed your cat the guts and
           eyeballs.
                         
          Sam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of
          newspaper. Suzy frowns.
                         
                          SUZY
           That's OK. He only eats cat food.
                         
          Suzy points to a cardboard box. Sam looks inside. It is
          filled with ten cans of cat food. Sam raises an eyebrow.
                         
                          SAM
           What else did you bring? We should make
           an inventory.
                         
                          SUZY
           OK.
                         
          Sam flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book.
                         
                          SAM
           Go ahead.
           28.
                         
                         
          Suzy opens the top of her portable record player. She
          displays it like a salesman.
                         
                          SUZY
           This is my record player. It works with
           batteries. Actually, it belongs to my
           little brother Lionel. I left him a note.
           Do you like music?
                         
          Sam nods and makes a note. Suzy opens her leather folder.
          There are three L.P. records in it. She takes out one by a
          French singer.
                         
                          SUZY
           This is my favorite record album. My
           godmother gave it to me for my birthday.
           She lives in France.
                         
          Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy opens her suitcase. It
          is filled to the brim with hard-back copies of fantasy books.
          It contains no other items of any kind (including clothing).
                         
                          SUZY
           These are my books. I like stories with
           magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms
           on earth or on foreign planets. Also,
           time-travel, if they make it realistic.
           Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not
           always. I couldn't bring all of them
           because it got too heavy. You can borrow
           any you want.
                         
          Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy produces a few more
                         ITEMS:
                         
                          SUZY
           I also brought my lefty scissors because
           I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some
           rubber bands, extra batteries, and my
           binoculars, as you know. I forgot my
           comb.
                         
          Sam surveys the entire collection of articles. He scratches
          his head.
                         
                          SAM
           That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No
           canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't
           you get the packing list I sent you in my
           last letter?
           29.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
                          (FROWNS)
           I thought that's what you're supposed to
           bring. I don't own a canteen.
                         
          Pause. Sam shrugs. He smiles.
                         
                          SAM
           That's OK. We can share.
                         
          Sam picks up one of the books. It is called The Girl from
          Jupiter. There is an illustration on the cover of a young,
          alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks. Sam
          examines the other books in the suitcase. He looks slightly
          puzzled.
                         
                          SAM
           These are all library books. In my school
           you're only allowed to check-out one at a
           time. Some of these are going to be
           overdue.
                         
          Sam hesitates. He suddenly realizes something. He asks
                         BLUNTLY:
                         
                          SAM
           Do you steal?
                         
          Silence. Suzy nods reluctantly. Sam looks confused.
                         
                          SAM
           Why? You're not poor.
                         
          Suzy stares at the books. She absently brushes some dust off
          them. She rearranges them slightly. She says finally:
                         
                          SUZY
           I might turn some of them back in one
           day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's
           bad. I think I just took them to have a
           secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason,
           it makes me feel in a better mood
           sometimes.
                         
          Sam thinks about this. He leans his chin against his fist. He
                         SAYS SERIOUSLY:
                         
                          SAM
           Are you depressed?
                         
          Suzy bites her fingernails. She shrugs.
                         
                          SAM
           How come?
           30.
                         
                         
          Pause. Suzy says philosophically:
                         
                          SUZY
           Well, I can show you an example, if you
           want -- but it doesn't make me feel very
           good. I found this on top of our
           refrigerator.
                         
          Suzy looks into her leather folder and shuffles through some
          pages. She withdraws a small pamphlet.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The cover of the pamphlet. There is a drawing of a broken tea-
          cup and the title "Coping with the Very Troubled Child".
                         
          Sam frowns. His eyes widen.
                         
                          SAM
           Does that mean you?
                         
          Suzy nods. Sam explodes with laughter.
                         
                          SUZY
           It's not funny.
                         
                          SAM
           To me, it is.
                         
          Sam slaps his knee and shakes his head. Pause. Suzy dumps her
          fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a
          frisbee into a tree trunk. It bounces off with a ding. She
          stands up and says coolly:
                         
                          SUZY
           You really know how to make friends.
                         
          Suzy walks away. She goes behind a bush and sits down on a
          rock. She starts to cry. Sam looks stricken and confused. He
          is very still. He gets up slowly. He tentatively approaches
          the bush. He looks behind it. He takes two steps closer. He
          stands above Suzy. He unties his neckerchief, crouches down,
          and holds it out.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Suzy looks to Sam. She hesitates. She takes the neckerchief.
                         
                          SUZY
           That's OK.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm on your side.
           31.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           I know.
                         
          Suzy dries her eyes. She unfolds the neckerchief and studies
          its design. It is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off
          the side of a galloping horse. Sam motions to the books:
                         
                          SAM
           Which one's the best?
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Dusk. Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his
          pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads
          aloud from a book called The Francine Odyssies. There is an
          illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a
          bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown.
                         
                          SUZY
           His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins,
           Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the
           rippling surface of the cool shallows and
           down to its stone floor. "My people once
           were lead by a great and noble beast --
           and I no longer see his face in this
           reflection."
                         
          Suzy looks to Sam. He is asleep. She takes the pipe out of
          his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp-fire. She draws a
          blanket over his chest. She continues:
                         
                          SUZY
           Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha,
           Francine rested. There would be another
           time for war.
                         
          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          The dining room. There is a long, wide, empty table with
          sixteen chairs around it. Tucked in the corner, Lionel,
          Murray, and Rudy sit at a folding card table. They have
          plates on place-mats and forks and knives. There is one extra
          seat. Mrs. Bishop's voice booms, amplified, from the next
                         ROOM:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Suzy! Dinner! I'm not going to say it
           again!
                         
          Pause. Mrs. Bishop charges into the room with a steaming
          casserole. She wears an oven mitt on one hand and carries an
          electric megaphone in the other. She sets the casserole on
          the card table and looks out the window. Through the thicket
           32.
                         
                         
          of trees behind the house, a pair of headlights blinks. Mrs.
          Bishop checks her watch. She says sharply:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Where's your sister?
                         
                          LIONEL
           I don't know, but she borrowed my record
           player for ten days without asking.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (CONFUSED)
           What does that mean?
                         
          Lionel holds up a small, folded-up piece of pink stationary.
          Mrs. Bishop snaps it out of his hand and opens it.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A short note on pink stationary in a girl's red felt-tip
          cursive. It reads:
                         
           Dear Lionel, I need to use your
           record player. I will give it back in
           ten days or less. Do not tell Mom.
           (Or Dad.) I will replace the batteries
           when I return. Signed, Suzy Bishop
                         
          Mrs. Bishop frowns. She bolts back out of the room. Her voice
                         BOOMS AGAIN:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Walt! Where the hell are you?
                         
          There is a loud thump upstairs. Mr. Bishop shouts from
                         OUTSIDE:
                         
           MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Right here! Why are you cursing at me?
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Exterior. Mr. Bishop leans out of an upstairs window. Mrs.
          Bishop appears in one below. She yells up through the
                         MEGAPHONE:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Does it concern you that your daughter's
           just run away from home?
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (PAUSE)
           That's a loaded question.
           33.
                         
                         
          Mrs. Bishop brandishes the note with her free hand.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Come down and read this.
                         
          A radio squawks in the woods behind the house. Mr. and Mrs.
          Bishop turn quickly toward the sound. Mrs. Bishop looks
          tense. Becky's garbled voice says over a tinny speaker:
                         
           BECKY (V.O.)
           Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no
           luck. They're going home for the --
                         
          There is a rustling and the sound of a car door opening --
          then the radio cuts off. Mr. Bishop frowns. He shouts:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Who's there?
                         
          Captain Sharp emerges slowly from the dark, tangled in a
          bramble, hopping slowly on one foot as he unwinds a root from
          around his ankle. He smiles awkwardly and says:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was
                          JUST --
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (ANGRILY)
           What are you doing here? Nobody called
           the police.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I know, that's what I'm saying. The
           search party's not over yet. In other
                          WORDS --
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Suzy's missing, too! Go find her.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (HESITATES)
           OK. Where'd she --
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Wait for me.
                         
          Mr. Bishop disappears into the house. Captain Sharp and Mrs.
          Bishop exchange an uncertain look.
                         
          INT. STATION WAGON. NIGHT
                         
          Captain Sharp pans a spot-light back and forth in the
          darkness while he steers the car. The lamp has a short in it
           34.
                         
                         
          and flickers with each bump. Mr. Bishop rides in the
          passenger seat. He stares ahead down the road and says to
                         HIMSELF:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           How can we help her? She's got so many
           problems. It's getting worse.
                         
          Mr. Bishop looks strangely to Captain Sharp. He asks:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Whose fault is it?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (HESITATES)
           I don't know, but just for the record:
           ninety-five percent of all runaways
           return home within six hours. That
           doesn't do you any good right now. It's
           just a statistic -- but in all likelihood
           Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at
           her best friend's house playing Chinese
           Checkers at this very moment, as we
           speak.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           She doesn't have any friends.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (LONG PAUSE)
           How's Laura?
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (IRRITATED)
           How's Laura?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Mrs. Bishop, I mean.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           I don't understand.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Is she upset?
                         
          Mr. Bishop looks baffled and disgusted. He throws his hands
          into the air. He looks away and shakes his head. Silence.
          Captain Sharp wiggles some wires.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I got to get this spot-light fixed.
           35.
                         
                         
          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          Captain Sharp and Mr. Bishop come to a stop and get out of
          the station wagon. They look dejected. The screen door bangs
          open, and Mrs. Bishop quickly descends the front steps with a
          open shoebox full of letters in her hands. She says
          breathlessly, shouting:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           She has a pen pal! It's very intimate!
           They planned this together!
                         
          Captain Sharp takes one of the letters and studies it. He
          says to himself:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Sam Shakusky. That's my escaped Khaki
           Scout. His family died.
                         
          Mr. Bishop takes a handful of the letters and flips through
          them. He stops suddenly. He looks horrified.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Holy Christ. What am I looking at?
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A small painting on construction paper of a naked girl
          stepping into a bathtub. She wears a flower in her hair.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop continues to shout as she explains:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           He does watercolors! Mostly landscapes,
           but a few nudes!
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy watch from a downstairs window.
          Lionel takes a bite from a bowl of melting ice cream. Mr.
          Bishop stares at the painting. He squints at it and asks
                         INCREDULOUSLY:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           She sit for this?
                         
          Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look over Mr. Bishop's
          shoulder. Captain Sharp says calmly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What does he say?

          The history of Sam and Suzy's correspondence.
           36.
                         
                         
          Sam, dressed in a greasy jump-suit, writes at a work bench in
          a garage while six teenagers take apart carburetors behind
          him. They are his foster brothers. Sam reads in voice-over:
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, You have a superb voice. You
           were my favorite animal in the program,
           by far. Please, find enclosed --
                         
          Suzy writes at a small desk on the upstairs landing while
          Lionel and Murray play a loud duet on a red piano behind her.
          (Rudy turns the pages of the sheet music.) Suzy reads in
                         VOICE-OVER:
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, Thank you very much. I got
           replaced as the raven because I yelled at
           Mrs. Lynn. After that I was only a blue
           jay, but --
                         
          Sam works in an alley emptying garbage from several small
          trash cans into a larger one. Mr. Billingsley watches
          television in a window, smoking a cigarette. He points to a
          crumpled wrapper on the ground. Sam picks it up.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, I am sorry your brothers are
           so selfish. Maybe they will grow out of
           it. Sometimes people do things without
           knowing the reasons for --
                         
          Suzy reads a book called Disappearance of the 6th Grade.
          There is an illustration on the cover of a school-teacher
          levitating at the front of her classroom. There are several
          watercolor pictures taped to the wall behind her. Most are
          landscapes of small-town vacant lots. One is a swimming girl
          in a bikini.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, You are an excellent painter,
           especially trees and telephone poles. Is
           the girl in the water supposed to be me?
           My favorite color is --
                         
          Sam stands in pajamas staring blankly, eyes wide, at a dog
          house in flames next to a rusty swing-set. A dachsund sits
          next to him, also watching. Mrs. Billingsley comes running
          out of the house with a fire extinguisher.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a fire
           while I was sleep-walking. I have no
           memory of this, but my foster parents
           think I am lying. Unfortunately, it is --
           37.
                         
                         
          Suzy stands in the kitchen looking out through a pane of
          glass with a hole smashed in the middle of it. Mrs. Bishop is
          next to her with her hair hanging over the sink while the two
          of them carefully pick bits of glass out of it.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, I am in trouble again because I
           threw a rock through the window. My mother
           still has glass in her hair. Also --
                         
          Five of Sam's foster brothers watch calmly as the sixth
          throws Sam against the wall then jumps on top of him, pinning
          his arms to the floor while Sam struggles crazily.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, I have been trying very hard
           to make friends, but I feel people do not
           like my personality. In fact, I can
           understand why they might --
                         
          A classroom of sixth graders watches in a panic as Suzy
          throttles one of her classmates. The classmate flails and
          grimaces as she is strangled.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, Now I am getting suspended
           because I got in a fight with Molly. She
           says I go berserk. Our principal is
           against me. Why do --
                         
          Sam does sit-ups on a hard mattress in a basement room lined
          with bunks. He counts out the repetitions under his breath.
          There is a small, black and white photograph of a man and
          woman at their wedding tacked to the wall above him.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your
           feelings, but they still love you. That
           is more important. If they --
                         
          Suzy stands in a doorway screaming at her family while they
          watch wearily from the dinner table with forks and knives in
          their hands.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, I do think you should think of
           their faces every day, even if it makes
           you sad. It is too bad they did not leave
           you more pictures of themselves. Can you --
                         
          Sam writes in his bunk crouched beneath a blanket with a
          Khaki Scout flashlight pointed at his paper.

           Dear Suzy, Here is my plan.
                         
          Suzy writes in her bed crouched beneath a quilt with a
          plastic lantern glowing beside her.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)

          window with the shoebox of letters beside her. Outside, the
          woods are black beyond a moonlit field.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, Walk four hundred yards due
           north from your house to the dirt path
           which has not got any name on it. Turn
           right and follow to the end.
                         
          Suzy raises her binoculars to her eyes.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           I will meet you in the meadow.

          The next morning. The end of the path cut through the high
          grass where Sam and Suzy met the day before. Captain Sharp,
          Scout Master Ward, Mrs. Bishop, and Becky stand in two groups
          talking. Gadge and Skotak stretch a string with ribbons tied
          to it from stake to stake marking a perimeter. Lazy-Eye walks
          with the wire-haired terrier pulling at its leash. Other
          scouts search the field and scan the horizon.
                         
          Captain Sharp's station wagon and Redford's motorcycle are
          parked in the dirt.
           39.
                         
                         
          Mr. Bishop stands off to the side by himself poking at the
          ground with a stick. He has two black eyes, and half his face
          is swollen and purple. Scout Master Ward asks Becky quietly:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           What happened to him?
                         
                          BECKY
           I'm not sure. I think he went searching
           in the dark.
                         
          Mr. Bishop says loudly without looking up from the ground:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           She stole the batteries out of my
           flashlight.
                         
          Scout Master Ward looks at Becky and grimaces. Becky raises
          an eyebrow. Mrs. Bishop stands next to Captain Sharp. They
          move slightly away from the others. Captain Sharp whispers
          quickly, almost inaudibly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I think he's onto us.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (INSTANTLY)
           Of course, he is.
                         
          Captain Sharp looks surprised and defensive. He whispers
                         BACK:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Of course, he is?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Of course, he is.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (CONFUSED)
           Why aren't we worried about that, then?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I am.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (ASTONISHED)
           Well, I didn't know. Or, anyway, I
           thought I was wrong. Did you hit him?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           No. He fell in a ditch.
           40.
                         
                         
          Nickleby pops up from below the tall grass and thrusts an
          empty can of cat food into the air. He shouts excitedly:
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           Cat food! I think it's a clue.
                         
          The group quickly gathers around Nickleby. Mr. Bishop
          snatches the can out of his hand and examines it. He says
                         BLANKLY:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           That's her.
                         
          Mr. Bishop throws the can away over his shoulder and walks
          off with his hands in his pockets. Nickleby runs after the
          can and picks it up again. Mr. Bishop continues down the
          hill. Scout Master Ward watches him. He asks Mrs. Bishop,
                         UNEASY:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Where's he going?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I don't know.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop follows Mr. Bishop. Captain Sharp turns to the
          rest of the group and says briskly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           All right. We know they're together. We
           know they're within a certain radius of
           this spot. I'm declaring the case with
           the county right now. Until help arrives:
                         
          Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward as he points to
          various scouts and divides the group into teams:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny
           one, and the kid with the curly hair to
           come with me in the station wagon. Randy,
           you drop-in and head up-river with the
           rest of your troop, then split-up on
           foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to
           circle over this end of the island and
           fly low.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of the seaplane flying in a pattern. It
          banks sharply. The binocular shot tilts down. Far below, in
          the distance, Captain Sharp's station wagon rumbles along a
          dirt road through the woods. The binocular shot pans wide. On
          the side of the river, Scout Master Ward's motorboat stops.
           41.
                         
                         
          Two scouts, tiny figures, pull the camouflage net off the
          hidden canoe.
                         
          EXT. HIGH RIDGE. DAY
                         
          Suzy watches through her binoculars while Sam crouches beside
          her. They are hidden behind a pile of rocks. Suzy says
                         OMINOUSLY:
                         
                          SUZY
           They found the canoe.
                         
                          SAM
           (angry at himself)
           Rats! I should've put more pine needles
           on it. Let's go. We're almost there.
                         
          Sam lifts his backpack onto his back and slings his air-rifle
          over his arm. Suzy picks up her suitcases and puts the kitten
          on her shoulder. They walk down a narrow path through a
          thicket. They emerge into a small clearing.
                         
          Sam and Suzy stop in their tracks.
                         
          Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and Lazy-Eye stand in a row
          along the edge of the woods ahead of them. Deluca brandishes
          his hunting knife. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye point their
          bows and arrows. Panagle holds his walking stick weapon. The
          wire-haired terrier strains growling at the end of his leash.
          Deluca jerks him back. The kitten cowers. The sound of a
          motorcycle guns, and Redford bursts through the trees, pops a
          wheelie, and skids to a stop. He lifts his goggles.
                         
          The motor idles. Sam says finally:
                         
                          SAM
           What do you creeps want?
                         
          Redford shrugs and answers with a callous smile:
                         
                          REDFORD
           We're looking for you.
                         
                          SAM
           Why?
                         
                          REDFORD
           Because you're a fugitive.
                         
                          SAM
           No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of
           resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts.
           42.
                         
                         
                          REDFORD
           You're still in uniform.
                         
          Pause. Sam quickly takes off his shirt and throws it aside.
                         
                          REDFORD
           Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. You
           don't have that authority. We've been
           deputized. Now are you going to come
           along peacefully or not?
                         
          Sam takes a deep breath. He pleads:
                         
                          SAM
           Listen to some reason: I don't like you.
           You don't like me. Why don't you stupid
           idiots just let us disappear?
                         
                          REDFORD
                          (PAUSE)
           It's tempting, but I can't allow it.
                         
          Deluca spits on the ground. He says to Suzy:
                         
                          DELUCA
           You shouldn't be friends with him.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (OFFENDED)
           Why not?
                         
                          DELUCA
           Because he's crazy.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (COLDLY)
           Maybe you just don't know him.
                         
                          REDFORD
           We know him a lot better than you. He's
           emotionally disturbed because his family
           died. Nickleby, tie him up.
                         
          Nickleby takes a step forward with his bow and arrow pointed
          and ready. Suzy looks furious. Sam flips his air-rifle off
          his shoulder with a twirl. He points it at Redford and
          Nickleby. Nickleby hesitates. Sam says darkly:
                         
                          SAM
           Do not cross this stick.
                         
          Sam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him. Silence.
           43.
                         
                         
                          REDFORD
           You're doomed, Shakusky.
                         
          Redford revs the motor, pops the clutch, and races across the
          clearing toward Sam and Suzy. The rest of the troop
          converges, yelling crazily.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The wide canyon echoing with shouts, screams, and a small
          explosion. One by one, Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and
          Lazy-Eye come running out of the trees and down the hill.
          Finally, Redford hobbles after them, limping and groaning and
          clutching his side.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Redford's charred, partially demolished motorcycle smoldering
          in the branches of a tree.
                         
          Suzy stands on the edge of the ravine staring at the pair of
          bloody scissors in her hand. She looks shaken. Sam takes the
          scissors, cleans them with his fingers, and hands them back
          to Suzy. He says gently:
                         
                          SAM
           It was him or us.
                         
          Suzy nods. She turns slowly away. Her eyes widen.
                         
                          SUZY
           Oh, no.
                         
          Suzy points. The wire-haired terrier lies on his back on the
          ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder
          blades. The kitten licks at the wound. Sam and Suzy run over
          to the wounded dog. Sam crouches down, gently presses the
          kitten away, and says bleakly:
                         
                          SAM
           They got Snoopy through the neck.
                         
          Suzy has tears in her eyes. She slides her hands under the
          wire-haired terrier's body. She begins to hyperventilate as
                         SHE SAYS:
                         
                          SUZY
           He needs a doctor.
                         
          Sam puts his finger to the wire-haired terrier's neck. He
                         SAYS SADLY:
                         
                          SAM
           No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue.
           44.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           (trying to catch her breath)
           He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go?
                         
          Suzy lifts the bleeding dog into her arms. Sam grabs her by
          the shoulders. He locks eyes with her and says with grit and
                         MELODRAMA:
                         
                          SAM
           Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to
           make it.
                         
                          SUZY
           (starting to cry)
           Don't say that.
                         
                          SAM
           They're after us. We got to move.
                         
                          SUZY
           (raising her voice)
           He's dying! We can't just leave him!
                         
                          SAM
                          (SHOUTING)
           It's too late! He's already gone!
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SCREAMING)
           Stop yelling at me!
                         
          Sam slaps Suzy in the face. She falls silent. He says slowly:
                         
                          SAM
           I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're
           panicking. The first rule in any
           emergency is you never --
                         
          Suzy drops the wire-haired terrier which hits the ground with
          a thud. She slaps Sam back with a huge, roundhouse smack. Sam
          falls over sideways. Suzy stands over him.
                         
                          SUZY
           Don't ever do that again. No one's
           allowed to slap me.
                         
          Sam stands up and dusts himself off. He and Suzy stare down
          at the lifeless animal. Suzy says quietly:
                         
                          SUZY
           You're right. He's dead.
                         
          Sam reaches into a side-picket of his back-pack and takes out
          an army-shovel. He assembles it. Suzy says hopefully:
           45.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Was he a good dog?
                         
          Pause. Sam shrugs. He says distantly, even cosmically:
                         
                          SAM
           Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to
           die.
                         
          Suzy slowly wraps her arm around Sam's shoulder. They squeeze
          each other tightly. Sam sighs. He begins to dig.
                         
          INT. STATION WAGON. DAY
                         
          Captain Sharp speeds bouncing down a winding dirt road. Lazy-
          Eye, Deluca, and Gadge sit next to him crowded into the
          passenger seat. Lazy-Eye yells into the hand-set of the
                         POLICE RADIO:
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           She stabbed Redford in the back with
           lefty scissors!
                         
          A voice responds over the speaker:
                         
           JED (V.O.)
           Repeat that, please? Over.
                         
          Captain Sharp grabs the hand-set out of Lazy-Eye's hand. He
          shouts into it:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room
           for a stretcher in the cockpit!
                         
          Redford is lying on his stomach on a towel in the rear of the
          vehicle. Scout Master Ward kneels next to him pressing his
          hand firmly into the middle of his back. There is significant
          blood. Redford moans loudly. Scout Master Ward reassures him:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You're going to be OK. Thank goodness,
           she missed the artery. Bite on this.
                         
          Scout Master Ward puts a pencil in Redford's teeth. Redford
          grimaces, crunching it. In the back seat, the rest of the
          troop excitedly re-cap:
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           I tried to chop him, but he dodged my
           tomahawk.
                         
                          PANAGLE
           Who else got hit?
           46.
                         
                         
                          IZOD
           Not me. I ran away when the girl went
           berserk.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           He's got great marksmanship. He shot
           Deluca in both arms.
                         
          Skotak points to the front seat. Deluca sits glumly in
          silence. He has numerous small welts all over his arms. Gadge
                         SAYS SUDDENLY:
                         
                          GADGE
           Where's Snoopy?
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
                         
          Captain Sharp's station wagon skids to a stop next to his
          office while the seaplane pulls up to the dock as Mr. and
          Mrs. Bishop approach pedalling furiously on bicycles. Mr.
          Bishop wears boating shoes. Captain Sharp and Scout Master
          Ward jump out of the car. Skotak and Gadge help them remove
          Redford on a stretcher from the back of the station wagon.
          Mr. Bishop struggles with his kick-stand. He shouts:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           What happened? Who's that? Why's he
           bleeding?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Clear the dock, Edgar!
                         
          Captain Sharp motions for the two old fishermen to get out of
          the way. He and Scout Master Ward run with the stretcher onto
          the dock. Mrs. Bishop is frantic:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Is Suzy with you?
                         
                          GADGE
           No, she's in the woods with Shakusky.
                         
          Gadge points toward the hills. A man wearing a jumpsuit and
          aviator sunglasses stands next to the seaplane. He is Jed. He
          shouts as the stretcher approaches:
                         
                          JED
           Where'm I going?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be
           right behind you.
           47.
                         
                         
          Captain Sharp motions for Skotak, Gadge, and Lazy-eye to help
          Jed load the stretcher into the small cockpit. He tosses a
          set of keys to Scout Master Ward and says:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Warm up the motor. I'll be right back.
                         
          Scout Master Ward takes the keys and starts untying the
          police launch. Captain Sharp heads toward his office. Mr.
          Bishop says firmly:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Hold it right there. You're not leaving
           this island. Our daughter's been abducted
           by one these beige lunatics.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Walt, it's very clear: the two of them
           conspired in this together.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Don't worry, Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.
           Sam's got excellent wilderness skills.
                         
          Mr. Bishop wheels on Scout Master Ward. He explodes:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Why can't you control your scouts?
                         
          Scout Master Ward recoils. He says quietly, troubled:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           I'm trying.
                         
          Mr. Bishop takes off his shoe and throws it at Scout Master
          Ward. Scout Master Ward ducks, and the shoe bounces off his
          back. Captain Sharp blocks Mr. Bishop.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Stop.
                         
          Mr. Bishop scuffles with Captain Sharp. Mrs. Bishop jerks him
          backwards and shouts:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Stop it, Walt!
                         
          Mr. Bishop faces Mrs. Bishop and Captain Sharp, breathing
          heavily. Scout Master Ward looks depressed. Jed, Gadge,
          Skotak, and Redford watch frozen from a gangplank alongside
          the seaplane.
           48.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I do blame him --
           (pointing to Scout Master Ward)
           -- but I also blame myself and both of
           you. With all due respect: you can't let
           your children stab people.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (HESITATES)
           What are you talking about?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           She's violent, Mrs. Bishop. Look.
                         
          Scout Master Ward shows Mrs. Bishop the blood all over his
          hands and uniform. Mrs. Bishop looks confused.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I don't get it. Were there witnesses?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Of course. It's assault.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I beg your pardon. Are you a lawyer?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           No, ma'am, but --
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (FURIOUS)
           Well, I am!
                         
          Captain Sharp gently draws Mrs. Bishop away by the shoulder.
          He links arms with her as he tries to placate the group:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Easy does it. Calm down, Laura.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Stay away from my wife.
                         
          Mr. Bishop pushes Captain Sharp away from Mrs. Bishop into
          Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward lunges at Mr. Bishop but
          is intercepted by Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop. They shout
                         REPEATEDLY:
                         
           CAPTAIN SHARP/MR. BISHOP SCOUT MASTER WARD/MRS. BISHOP
          Dammit! Christ! Shit! Jesus!
                         
          At this moment, a voice interjects from the shore:
           49.
                         
                         
           NARRATOR (O.S.)
           Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, Captain
           Sharp?
                         
          Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Mr. and Mrs. Bishop
          stop fighting and turn around at once. They see: the
          narrator. He stands at the foot of the dock holding a journal
          with rubber bands wrapped around it. They all stare at him
          blankly. He continues:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           As some of you know, I taught Sam for the
           cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a
           smart boy, and he expressed a keen
           interest in the history of the island's
           indigenous peoples. In particular, I
           recall his fascination with the idea of
           retracing the original path of the old
           Chickchaw harvest migration.
                         
          Long pause. Everyone looks utterly perplexed. The propeller
          of the seaplane starts up, and they all shield their eyes
          from the blast of wind and dust. The narrator hesitates. He
          yells over the noise:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           What I'm getting at is this: I think I
           know where they're going.
                         
          The narrator removes the rubber bands from his journal.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A carefully hand-drafted nautical chart. A cove is marked
          with a red arrow and the caption Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The portable record player. Suzy's fingers place the needle
          onto a spinning disc.
                         
          EXT. TIDAL LAGOON. DAY
                         
          A small cove enclosed by a low, rocky cliff. It forms an
          almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines, flowers,
          and branches. A thin channel leads out to the ocean. The sand
          on the shore is white, and the water is perfectly clear and
          crowded with shells at the bottom. Birds echo and fly from
          tree to tree.
                         
          Sam's and Suzy's luggage is piled on the beach. The kitten
          wanders, exploring. The lid of the portable record player is
          open. The voice of Leonard Bernstein says over the speaker:
           50.
                         
                         
           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
           Onto the bird-house, where every kind of
           bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling
           around. This is a real acrobatic act for
           our gifted young flute player, Paula
           Robeson.
                         
          As they listen, Sam and Suzy take off their shoes and socks
          and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove.
          They each climb up a rock over the water. They look at each
          other across the lagoon. They both laugh. Suzy shouts,
                         SMILING:
                         
                          SUZY
           This is weird.
                         
                          SAM
           I know!
                         
          Sam takes off his coon-skin cap and throws it aside. Suzy
          removes her cardigan and drops it on the ground. Sam strips
          off his uniform down to his white briefs. Suzy take off
          everything except her underwear and a training bra. They
          throw their clothes into the water. Sam yells:
                         
                          SAM
           On three!
                         
          Suzy immediately counts very quickly. They both scream as
          they leap into the water. They swim toward each other,
          laughing and shouting.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A clothesline hung with Sam's and Suzy's wet clothes swaying
          like flags and snapping in the wind. The tent has been
          pitched on a low, sandy plateau close to the water. Two lines
          of shells mark a path to the entrance. A long stick is jammed
          into the ground with a flickering safety-candle stuck into
          the Y at the top. The kitten is asleep.
                         
          Sam sits on a folding stool in front of a portable easel. He
          dips his brush into a tin cup and paints. Suzy poses
          stretched out and propped up on one arm. She adjusts herself
          slightly.
                         
                          SUZY
           I like it here, but I don't like the
           name.
                         
                          SAM
           Me, neither.
           51.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring
           to it.
                         
                          SAM
           Let's change it. What should it be?
                         
                          SUZY
           Let me think for a minute.
                         
          Sam continues to paint while Suzy thinks.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of a deep blue, star-filled sky.
                         
          Suzy lies on her back on a flat rock in the middle of the
          cove looking up into the night. Sam wades out to her and
          climbs up beside her.
                         
                          SAM
           I made you some jewelry.
                         
          Sam holds up two dead, shimmering, opalescent beetles with
          fish-hooks threaded into their shells. Suzy looks enchanted.
                         
                          SAM
           Are your ears pierced?
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Inside the tent, lit by a lantern. Sam clenches his teeth as
          he forces one of the fish-hooks through Suzy's earlobe. Suzy
          screams murderously. Sam releases her. The beetle dangles
          neatly. A line of blood runs down the side of Suzy's neck.
          Sam holds up a little mirror. Suzy nods.
                         
                          SUZY
           It's pretty. Do the other one.
                         
          Sam switches to Suzy's other earlobe. She resumes her
          screaming.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam and Suzy standing on the beach listening to the French
          singer's record. They face each other, bobbing their heads
          and tilting awkwardly to the music. Suzy eventually begins to
          dance. Sam does something vaguely like the Twist. They press
          against each other and kiss. Suzy says quietly:
                         
                          SUZY
           It feels hard.
           52.
                         
                         
                          SAM
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Do you mind?
                         
                          SUZY
           I like it.
                         
                          SAM
                          (PAUSE)
           Tilt your head sideways.
                         
          Sam and Suzy kiss again. Sam pushes his hands through Suzy's
          hair and draws it back behind her ears. Suzy whispers:
                         
                          SUZY
           You can touch my chest.
                         
          Sam slides his hand up under the training bra and presses it
          onto Suzy's breast.
                         
                          SUZY
           They're going to grow more.
                         
          Sam nods. He looks to be in a trance.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam and Suzy sitting on a tree branch over the water eating
          raisins from Sam's hand. Suzy has flowers in her hair. She
          looks down into the water with her binoculars.
                         
                          SAM
           Why do you always use binoculars?
                         
          Suzy thinks for minute. She says finally:
                         
                          SUZY
           It helps me see things closer. Even if
           they're not very far away. I pretend it's
           my magic power.
                         
                          SAM
                          (IMPRESSED)
           That sounds like poetry. Poems don't
           always have to rhyme, you know. They're
           just supposed to be creative.
                         
          Suzy gives Sam the binoculars. He points them at her and
          stares.
                         
                          SAM
           What do you want to be? When you grow up.
           53.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           I don't know. I want to go on adventures,
           I think. Not get stuck in one place. How
           about you?
                         
                          SAM
                          (PAUSE)
           Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck,
           too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm
           just repeating what you just said, but I
           couldn't think of anything as good as it.
           On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown
           up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the
           exact future.
                         
                          SUZY
           That's true.
                         
                          SAM
           It's possible I may wet the bed, by the
           way. Later, I mean.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SURPRISED)
           OK.
                         
                          SAM
                          (RELUCTANTLY)
           I wish I didn't have to mention it, but
           just in case. I don't want to make you be
           offended.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SOFTLY)
           Of course, I won't.
                         
                          SAM
           Some people frown on these problems.
                         
          Suzy nods. She holds Sam's hand. She points to the scorpion
          brooch pinned to Sam's shirt.
                         
                          SUZY
           What's that one for?
                         
          Sam looks at the brooch. He shakes his head.
                         
                          SAM
           It's not an accomplishment. I inherited
           it from my mother. It's actually not
           meant for a male to wear -- but I don't
           give a damn.
                         
          Suzy nods thoughtfully. Pause.
           54.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Are your foster parents still mad at you?
           For getting in trouble so much.
                         
                          SAM
           I don't think so. We're getting to know
           each other better. I feel like I'm in a
           family now. Not like yours, but similar
           to one.
                         
                          SUZY
           I always wished I was an orphan. Most of
           my favorite characters are. I think your
           lives are more special.
                         
          Sam frowns. Tears suddenly well-up in his eyes. He shakes his
          head.
                         
                          SAM
           I love you, but you don't know what
           you're talking about.
                         
          Long pause. Suzy says genuinely:
                         
                          SUZY
           I love you, too.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A campfire burns in front of the tent. Sam lies on his back
          on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits
          Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud from a book called
          The Light of Seven Matchsticks. There is an illustration on
          the cover of a child's hand extinguishing a little flame. A
          ribbon of smoke curls between its fingers.
                         
                          SUZY
           The flashlight's beam drew a moon through
           the black across the attic and settled on
           a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no
           bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched
           on his flat feet and placed his hand in
           front of the tiny opening. "It's windy,"
           he said. "Like someone in there's blowing
           on my fingers." Christy rolled her eyes
           and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she
           thought. Little brothers drive people
           crazy.
                         
          Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam nods and
          signals for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page and reads
                         ON:
           55.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Part Two.
                         
                         OMIT
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The next morning. Sam and Suzy are asleep with their arms
          wrapped around each other inside the tent. They wear only
          their underwear. The sound of an airplane approaches. Sam's
          eyes open. The noise buzzes by loudly overhead. Suzy sits up.
          Sam scrambles to his feet, unzips the flaps of the tent, and
          looks out. Suzy crouches beside him, holding onto his leg.
                         THEY SEE:
                         
          Captain Sharp standing on the beach fifteen feet away. Scout
          Master Ward waits behind him with Gadge, Skotak, and Lazy-
          Eye. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop stride up out of the water. Mr.
          Bishop looks incensed. They are wet to the waist. The police
          launch is moored in the lagoon. Two larger boats with St.
          Jack Wood Fire Brigade printed on their hulls float further
          away. Men in red caps stand on their decks.
                         
          Suzy pulls Sam back inside. She zips up the tent again. She
          kisses Sam. Mr. Bishop hollers:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Suzy! Get out here!
                         
          Mr. Bishop grabs hold of the entire tent by the top and rips
          it up out of the ground, uprooting the stakes which go
          flying. This reveals:
                         
          Sam and Suzy, half-naked, entwined, kissing.
                         
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both freeze. Sam and Suzy look up to
          them. Mr. Bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a
          monster. Sam and Suzy look horrified. Mr. Bishop's face
          suddenly drains of all emotion. Pause. Mrs. Bishop commands
          Sam and Suzy:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Put your clothes on. Both of you.
                         
          Sam and Suzy remain perfectly still. Mrs. Bishop grabs Suzy
          by the arm and jerks her to her feet. Sam and Suzy hang onto
          each other. Mrs. Bishop slaps Suzy with a whack. Sam lets go,
          and Suzy is gone.
                         
          Scout Master Ward comes over to Sam sadly and hands him his
          uniform. Sam takes it. Scout Master Ward turns to the other
          scouts, claps his hands twice, and says:
           56.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Strike this camp.
                         
          Sam starts putting on his socks. Captain Sharp watches him.
                         
          EXT. POLICE LAUNCH. DAY
                         
          Captain Sharp drives his boat along the coast with a grim
          look on his face. Suzy rides in the back with Mr. and Mrs.
          Bishop. Sam rides in the front with the other scouts. An
          interrogation is in progress:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           How long were you planning to stay there?
                         
                          SAM
           I don't know.
                         
                          MURRAY
           You said ten days or less.
                         
                          SUZY
           That was a lie.
                         
                          GADGE
           Didn't you ever think about what would
           happen next?
                         
                          SAM
           Not to my recollection.
                         
                          LIONEL
           You're a traitor to our family.
                         
                          SUZY
           Good. I want to be.
                         
          Scout Master Ward sits next to Captain Sharp. He shows him
          the air-mail envelope.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           What do I do about this?
                         
          Captain Sharp shrugs. He says, resigned:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Give him his mail.
                         
          Scout Master Ward turns to Sam. He holds out the envelope.
          Sam takes it. He opens it. He reads. Suzy watches him from
          across the boat. She calls out anxiously:
                         
                          SUZY
           What does it say?
           57.
                         
                         
                          SAM
                          (PUZZLED)
           They can't invite me back.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (OUTRAGED)
           Why not?
                         
                          SAM
                          (UPSET)
           I gave them too much aggravation.
                         
          Suzy stands up. She says as she starts across the boat:
                         
                          SUZY
           Let me read it.
                         
          Sam holds out the note. Mr. Bishop pulls Suzy back down to
          her seat. He stands up, himself, and walks over to Sam. He
          takes him by the wrist and leads him to a small cabin. He
          opens the door and presses him forward. Sam stumbles down the
          steps and looks back. Mr. Bishop shuts the door. Captain
          Sharp glares at him. Suzy says icily:
                         
                          SUZY
           That's child abuse.
                         
          Mr. Bishop returns to the back of the boat and sits down
          again. He gives Suzy a direct order:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Be advised: the two of you will never see
           each other again. Those were your last
           words. Do you understand?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (DARKLY)
           I'd be careful if I were you. One of
           these days somebody's going to be pushed
           too far, and who knows what they're
           capable of.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (HESITATES)
           Is that a threat?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SIMPLY)
           It's a warning.
                         
          Suzy looks from Captain Sharp to Mrs. Bishop and back to Mr.
          Bishop. Mr. Bishop falls silent.
           58.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           I wish I knew what makes you tick.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (HESITATES)
           I beg your pardon?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Please, terminate this conversation.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (TO LIONEL)
           She's saying that to me?
                         
          Lionel shakes his head bitterly. Suzy stares out to sea.
          Scout Master Ward walks over to the cabin, opens the door,
          and goes inside.
                         
          INT. POLICE LAUNCH. DAY
                         
          A small room with two bunks, two portholes, and a pile of
          ropes. Sam sits hunched over with his hands in his lap. He
          stares at the envelope. Scout Master Ward sits down across
          from him. He motions to the envelope and says quietly,
          pausing between each sentence:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           I'm sorry about this. I didn't know your
           situation. It's not on the register.
           How'd you lose your parents? I shouldn't
           ask that. Never mind. I wish we had time
           for an inspection back there. On the
           beach. I would've given you a
           "commendable". That was one of the best-
           pitched camp-sites I've ever seen.
           Honestly.
                         
          Sam does not respond. Scout Master Ward asks in a wounded
                         VOICE:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You don't want to be a Khaki Scout
           anymore?
                         
          Sam shakes his head.
                         
          INT. POST OFFICE. DAY
                         
          Becky sits at the switchboard with her head-phones on.
          Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward sit behind her wearing
          their own sets of head-phones. There is a click on the other
          end of the line.
           59.

           Hello, Becky.
                         
                          BECKY
           Judy, I have your person-to-person from
           New Penzance.
                         
           OPERATOR (V.O.)
           Go ahead, New Penzance.

          Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
          Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a
          fifty-year-old woman in a blue and white uniform pants-suit
          with a Salvation Army officer-style hat and a red ribbon tied
          in a bow around her neck. She is Social Services. She sits at
          a desk in a cinder block office. Guards and orderlies criss-
          cross in a bullet-proof window to a long, grey corridor
          behind her.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Hello? This is Captain Sharp.
                         
          Social Services flips open a file-folder and picks up a ball-
          point pen. (She takes notes throughout the conversation.) She
          says into her telephone:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social
           Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam
           Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand
           he's in your custody.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           That's correct.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           What's his condition? Has he suffered any
           injury or trauma of any kind?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           He's OK.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Very good. How do I get to you?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can
           bring you in with the mail.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's
           acceptable to you. Is someone able to
                          (MORE)
           60.
                         
           SOCIAL SERVICES (cont'd)
           provide reasonable care and nourishment
           for the boy until that time?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Uh-huh.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Is that a yes?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Uh-huh.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Very good. I'll contact you again before
           the end of the day.
                         
          Social Services starts to hang up the telephone. Captain
          Sharp says abruptly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Wait a second.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (HESITATES)
           Yes?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Social Services?
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (EVENLY)
           Captain Sharp.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (ANXIOUS)
           What's going to happen to him?
                         
          Pause. Social Services puts down her pen. She clasps her
          hands together in front of her. She says finally:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Well, normally, we'd try to place him in
           another foster home, but that option is
           no longer available to us, in my opinion,
           with his case history -- which means
           he'll go to Juvenile Refuge.
                         
          Captain Sharp exchanges a look with Scout Master Ward. Scout
          Master Ward interjects:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           What's that? An orphanage?
                         
          Social Services frowns. She asks calmly:
           61.
                         
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Who's speaking?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           This is Scout Master Ward.
                         
          Social Services refers to a document in her file-folder. She
          nods.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Right. An orphanage -- but the first step
           is the admissions panel requires a
           psychological evaluation to determine
           whether or not the boy's a candidate for
           institutional treatment or electroshock
           therapy. Beyond that --
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that
           be necessary? He's not violent.
                         
          Social Services picks up the document. She points to it.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           The report describes an assault with
           scissors.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (OBJECTING)
           That was the girl! Who did that.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (PAUSE)
           Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but
           that's not our job. OK?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (LONG PAUSE)
           OK.
                         
          Social Service hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords
          out of their sockets. Scout Master Ward looks to Captain
          Sharp. Silence.
                         
          Becky opens a tin of home-made lemon bars. Captain Sharp
          declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He looks
          completely enchanted.
                         
          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          The living room. There is a wicker rocking chair, a vase
          filled with wilted wildflowers, and a portrait of some
           62.
                         
                         
          Pilgrims hanging over a stone fireplace. Lionel, Murray, and
          Rudy sit together on the floor playing Parchesi.
                         
          Mr. Bishop lurches into the doorway, shirtless. He carries an
          open bottle of red wine with a glass in one hand and a long-
          handled woodsman's axe in the other.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           I'll be out back.
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Lionel look up from their game. Mr.
          Bishop hesitates. He seems slightly disoriented.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           I'm going to find a tree to chop down.
                         
          Mr. Bishop exits. Pause. Lionel rolls a pair of dice.
                         
          INT. SUZY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT
                         
          Old linoleum floor. Dark curtainless window. One bare light
          bulb. Suzy sits erect in the bathtub staring blankly into
          space. Mrs. Bishop washes her with a soapy sponge. Suzy's
          clothes and leather folder are in the corner with the kitten
          scratching at them.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean.
           I've had moments myself where I say: what
           am I doing here? Who made this decision?
           How could I allow myself to do something
           so stupid --
                          (WITH FEELING)
           -- and why is it still happening? We
           women are more emotional. You have to
                          REMEMBER --
                         
          Suzy turns to Mrs. Bishop and interrupts:
                         
                          SUZY
           I hate you.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (HESITATES)
           Don't say "hate".
                         
                          SUZY
           Why not? I mean it.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           You think you mean it. In this moment.
           You're trying to hurt me.
           63.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Exactly.
                          (PAUSE)
           I know what you do with that sad, dumb
           police man. You go to bed with him.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop looks stunned. She says quietly:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           He's not dumb, but I guess he is kind of
           sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that.
           It's not appropriate for me to even
           acknowledge what I already just said.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop sees something sticking out of the leather
          folder. She pulls it out and stares at it. It is the "Coping
          with the Very Troubled Child" pamphlet. She looks to Suzy.
          Suzy looks away. Mrs. Bishop sighs deeply and says, on the
          verge of tears:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for
           you?
                         
          Suzy starts to cry. She covers her face. Her voice breaks as
                         SHE SAYS:
                         
                          SUZY
           We're in love. We just want to be
           together. What's wrong with that?
                         
          Mrs. Bishop puts her arms around Suzy. Suzy shakes, silently
          sobbing. Mrs. Bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of Suzy's
          hair. She studies the beetle earrings. She says wearily:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Oh, my God. How are we going to get these
           fish-hooks out?
                         
          INT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT
                         
          Captain Sharp cooks sausages on a skillet in a kitchenette.
          He has a bottle of beer in his hand. Sam sits waiting at a
          fold-out table with a glass of milk in front of him. He says
          without looking up:
                         
                          SAM
           I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That
           part's true. We knew people would be
           worried, and we still ran away, anyway --
           but something also happened which we
           didn't do on purpose. When we first met
           each other. Something happened to us.
           64.
                         
                         
          Captain Sharp stirs the sausages in the pan. He nods. He says
                         SERIOUSLY:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I agree with you. That's eloquent. I
           can't argue against anything you're
           saying -- but I don't have to, because
           you're twelve years old.
                         
          Captain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves
          three links onto one plate and three onto another. He sits
          down.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Look, let's face it, you're probably a
           much more intelligent person than I am.
           In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart
           kids sometimes stick their fingers in
           electrical sockets, if you see what I
           mean. It takes time to figure things out.
           It's been proven by history: all mankind
           makes mistakes. It's our job to try to
           protect you from the dangerous ones. If
           we can.
                         
          Captain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides
          it over to Sam.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           You want a slug?
                         
          Sam nods. He and Captain Sharp both drink sips. Captain Sharp
          asks gently and sincerely:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What's the rush? You've got your whole
           life in front of yourself. Ahead of you,
           I mean.
                         
                          SAM
                          (SHRUGS)
           Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (DEFENSIVE)
           What does that have to do with it? So are
           you.
                         
                          SAM
                          (SADLY)
           That's true. Did you love someone ever?
           65.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (PAUSE)
           Yes, I did.
                         
                          SAM
           What happened?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           She didn't love me back.
                         
                          SAM
           Ah.
                         
          Sam considers this. Captain Sharp looks depressed. They start
          eating their sausages. Captain Sharp says quietly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's
           what people say.
                         
                          SAM
           Thanks.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What happened?
                         
                          SAM
           A drunk truck driver smashed into them.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (PAINED)
           Good grief.
                         
          Silence. Captain Sharp refills both their beer glasses.
                         
          INT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. NIGHT
                         
          Scout Master Ward sits on his cot in his pajamas again with a
          cigarette in his mouth. His tape recorder is recording. He
          says into the microphone:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Scout Master's Log. September fourth.
                         
          Scout Master Ward hesitates. He thinks for a minute. He takes
          a deep breath. He closes his eyes. He opens them again. He
          looks desperate. He looks up at the ceiling. He shakes his
          head. He presses stop. He kneels on the floor with his palms
          together and smokes.
                         
          There is a slight commotion outside. Scout Master Ward
                         SHOUTS:
           66.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Stow it, out there! I want to hear some
           Z's!
                         
          INT. TREE HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          The fort sixty feet above the camp. It is still under
          construction. The entire troop (with the exceptions of
          Redford and Sam) has gathered for a clandestine meeting. They
          all wear pajamas. Skotak stands on a balcony with his back to
          the group and his hands on a wooden railing.
                         
                          GADGE
           I heard he's going to reform school.
                         
                          DELUCA
           I heard they're going to take out a piece
           of his brain and send him to an insane
           asylum.
                         
                          ROOSEVELT
           I like his girl.
                         
                          PANAGLE
           She's too scruffy for me.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           Supposedly, they got to third base.
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           That's not true. He just felt her up.
                         
                          ROOSEVELT
                          (DEEPLY INTRIGUED)
           Over-shirt or under-shirt?
                         
          Skotak slams his fist on the railing. Everyone looks
          startled. Skotak turns around to face the group. He says
                         ANGRILY:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Damn us.
                         
          The railing collapses behind Skotak, ripping part of a wall
          and a row of shingles off the structure as it falls away.
          There is a moment of silence before it hits the ground with a
          splintering thud. Skotak hesitates. He moves a half-step away
          from the edge. He continues:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           This troop has been very shabby to Field
           Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a
           bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so
           unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's
                          (MORE)
           67.
                         
                          SKOTAK (CONT'D)
           emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a
           disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?
                         
          Skotak moves among the group, looking from face to face, as
                         HE ASKS:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye?
           (from the heart)
           Gadge?
                         
          Skotak circles around the edge of the tree house. He says
                         WITH FEELING:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs
           our help. Are we man enough to give that?
           So part of his brain doesn't get removed
           out of him.
                         
          Skotak stands still. He says mysteriously:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           They were prepared to die for each other
           out there.
                         
          Silence. The other scouts begin to murmur to each other,
          shaking their heads, shrugging, whispering, and gesturing.
          Finally, Deluca looks up to Skotak.
                         
                          DELUCA
           What do you need?
                         
                          SKOTAK
                          (EXCITED)
           For starters? Three yards of chicken
           wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a
           bucket of wheatpaste.
                         
          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          A thick tree has been chopped almost completely through its
          trunk. For some reason, it remains standing. Mr. Bishop sits
          on the ground leaning against it. He breathes heavily. The
          axe rests across his lap.
                         
          A twig snaps. Mr. Bishop looks up, listening. Pause. He
          drinks a sip of wine.
                         
          In the background, on the other side of the lawn, five small
          silhouettes run silently in a row away from the house into
          the trees on the left. A moment later, one taller silhouette
          rides a bicycle silently away from the house into the trees
          on the right.
           68.
                         
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD. NIGHT
                         
          Captain Sharp sits on the hood of his station wagon. Mrs.
          Bishop leans against it with her bicycle in front of her.
          They smoke cigarettes. Captain Sharp says sadly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           In other words, it's over.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I guess so. For the moment.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Until further notice.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           That's right.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I understand.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I've got to do better. For everybody.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Except me.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Except you.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (SINCERELY)
           Well, I hope you can. I think you will.
           You're doing the right thing.
                         
          Pause. Captain Sharp suddenly slides his hand inside Mrs.
          Bishop's shirt onto her breast and simultaneously kisses her
          -- then just as suddenly gets into his car and starts the
          engine. Mrs. Bishop hesitates. She reaches inside the window
          and puts her hand on the top of Captain Sharp's head. She
          says, worried:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Who know what's going to happen, Duffy?
           I'll probably see you tomorrow.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (CALMLY)
           No, you won't.
                         
          Silence. The motor idles. Captain Sharp says distantly:
           69.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I admire them, you know? There's a purity
           to it. I only feel bad because they both
           seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable
           people -- but maybe that's romantic.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (PUZZLED)
           I don't see it that way.
                         
          Captain Sharp puts the car into gear and drives off. Mrs.
          Bishop finishes her cigarette. She gets on her bicycle and
          rides away.
                         
          INT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT
                         
          A burning match drops down into the fireplace near the foot
          of a bunk where Sam lies sleeping. He has the sheet pulled up
          to his chin, but his toes stick out. He opens one eye. Dust
          descends and settles. Something scrapes and scratches. The
          flame burns out.
                         
          Sam slides slowly off the mattress and creeps across the
          floor. He crouches in front of the fireplace. He flicks on a
          scout flashlight and sees:
                         
          The end of a hanging rope.
                         
          Sam leans quickly into the fireplace and looks straight up,
          shining his flashlight. Skotak is looking down at him from
          the top of the chimney. He puts his finger to his lips. Sam
                         WHISPERS SHARPLY:
                         
                          SAM
           Get out of my chimney.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Listen to me. We're here for friendship.
           We're going to get you off this island.
                         
                          SAM
                          (LONG PAUSE)
           No, thanks.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue.
                         
                          SAM
           It's worthless to me. There's no point.
           Not without Suzy.
                         
          Skotak gestures for Sam to wait. He disappears from view. A
          moment later, Suzy's face appears at the top of the chimney,
          smiling toothily. Sam looks ecstatic.
           70.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           How'd you get here?
                         
                          SUZY
           They snuck me down the laundry chute and
           left a paper-maché dummy in my bed.
                         
                          SAM
                          (IMPRESSED)
           Diversion tactics. Good thinking.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The next room. Captain Sharp sleeps in boxer shorts on the
          floor of the kitchenette in the dark. He snores quietly.
                         
          EXT. ROUGH CHANNEL. NIGHT
                         
          Five mini-canoes race across a wide, choppy strait close to
          the open sea. Skotak, Deluca, Nickleby, Gadge, Lazy-Eye,
          Panagle, Roosevelt, Chef, and Izod paddle aggressively. We
          hear in voice-over:
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Where we going?
                         
           SKOTAK (V.O.)
           Fort Lebanon. My cousin Ben runs the
           Supply and Resources outpost for the
           Jubilee. He's a Falcon Scout,
           Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to
           do.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Can we trust him?
                         
           SKOTAK (V.O.)
           Normally, I'd say no.
                         
          Sam and Suzy ride in the back of the canoe that Skotak rows.
          Sam has his arms around Suzy's waist. The kitten is on her
          shoulder. Sam sees the portable record player among Suzy's
          things.
                         
                          SAM
           Did you leave another note for Lionel?
                         
                          SUZY
           Not this time. He can't keep his trap
           shut. Besides, I'll probably never see
           him again.
           71.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           That's true.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A pebble beach below high dunes. Large waves sweep into the
          shore. Spray blows through the air. There is a black
          lighthouse on a rocky point in the distance. The narrator
          stands at the water's edge holding a meteorologist's
          measuring stick. He braces himself against the gusting winds.
          He speaks to the camera:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           This is the island of St. Jack Wood,
           extending far north from Land's End along
           the deep-water channel that leads to
           Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates
           the beach from the town-ship above. A
           small but prosperous community.
                         
          The narrator takes out a pocket barometer. He reads it. He
                         SAYS GRAVELY:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           The barometer reads twenty-seven inches
           and dropping. Strong winds, as you can
           see, already at twenty-two knots.
           (checks his watch)
           The time is now four thirty-five A.M.
                         
          The narrator walks quickly out of the shot. The five canoes
          land on the beach with the tide. Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the
          rest of the troop quickly jump out and drag the boats up the
          shore.
                         
          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          The room is black. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop lie in separate single
          beds side-by-side. They both stare at the ceiling. The
          windows rattle, the walls creak, and trees sway outside.
                         
          Long pause. Mrs. Bishop whispers:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Did you file the motion for continuance?
           Peabody vs. Henderson.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           It was sustained.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Good.
           72.
                         
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (PAUSE)
           Did the judge consider your application
           for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           He granted it.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Great.
                         
          Silence. Mrs. Bishop's voice breaks as she says quietly:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I'm sorry, Walt.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           It's not your fault. Which injuries are
           you apologizing for? Specifically.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (WISTFULLY)
           Half of those were self-inflicted.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop shakes her head and smiles with tears on her
          face. A powerful blast of wind shakes the room. A night-light
          blinks. Mr. Bishop has a lump in his throat as he says:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           I hope the roof flies off, and I get
           sucked up into space. You'll be better
           off without me.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (SADLY)
           Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (PAINED)
           Why?
                         
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop look across at each other in the dark.
          Mrs. Bishop says desperately:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           We're all they've got, Walt.
                         
          Mr. Bishop takes a deep breath. He says finally, with a
                         DAWNING REALIZATION:
           73.
                         
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           It's not enough.
                         
          INT. STONE CAVE. NIGHT
                         
          Flashlight and lantern flames flicker over the jagged walls.
          Skotak is curled in a blanket on a high rock. Gadge is tucked
          into a sleeping bag under a ledge. The troop nestle on rocks
          and ledges in bedrolls and sleeping bags all around the deep
          cavern.
                         
          Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe
          while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud
          from a book called Annabelle's Midnight. There is an
          illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a
          window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her.
                         
                          SUZY
           "-- but I'm not going," said Barnaby
           Jack. "I'm running away tonight for good,
           and this time I won't get caught."
           Annabelle whispered: "I'm coming with
           you." Her yellow hair, now brown at the
           roots, caught up in the wind and danced.
           Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and
           pressed something into it the size of a
           jellybean. "Hide this in your socks, and
           be ready at midnight."
                         
          Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam looks to
          the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake. They
          all nod and signal for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page
          and reads on:
                         
                          SUZY
           He leapt out the window and landed in the
           fresh-fallen snow.
                         
          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
                         
          The next morning. Camp Ivanhoe. Scout Master Ward emerges
          from his tent. He puts on his hat. The wind whips it off his
          head. He chases it, catches it, and puts it back on with the
          chin-strap tight. He frowns. He shouts:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           No bugle? No reveille? Lazy-eye, Gadge,
           Deluca, Izod? Where's my troop? Let's go!
           You're late!
                         
          Scout Master Ward tries to light a cigarette, but the match
          blows out. He walks past the latrine, the workbench, the row
          of smaller tents, and the charcoal grill. He throws his hands
          into the air.
           74.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Chef? Breakfast?
                         
          Scout Master Ward shakes his head. He arrives at the picnic
          table and rings his bell. He sits down. He opens a new issue
          of Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover of a scout
          troop rappelling in Tasmania. He struggles to keep the
          rippling pages from turning by themselves.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The first page. There is another drawing of the Scout Master-
          in-Chief. This time he is behind the wheel of a ship. His
          signature below, once again, reads Commander Pierce. There is
          a quotation in large text: "Anyone can hold the helm when the
          sea is calm."
                         
          Pause. Scout Master Ward lowers his magazine. He looks
          around, confused. Something dawns on him.
                         
          INT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
                         
          A small entourage of teenage scouts studies maps, charts, and
          documents at folding tables. One of them sits at a telegraph
          machine. He wears headphones and taps Morse code on a paddle
          as he listens to a transmission. He looks puzzled. He swivels
          his chair to a steno-machine and begins typing rapidly.
                         
          EXT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
                         
          A triple-sized tent with a canopy in front and a large totem
          pole looming over it. It stands on five-foot stilts. There is
          a school bus parked next to it with letters painted across
          its side which read Regional Jubilee.
                         
          A forty-five-year-old scout master with several medals on his
          chest is sharpening a straight razor. He is Secretary
          McIntire. He adjusts a hot towel on the face of a man in a
          barber's chair.
                         
          The young telegraph operator hurries out of the tent carrying
          a strip of paper. He hands it to Secretary McIntire.
          Secretary McIntire stares at it. He says to the man under the
                         TOWEL:
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           You're not going to believe this one,
           sir. That Scout Master on New Penzance?
           Has now lost his entire troop.
                         
          The seated man whips the towel off his face and rises to his
          feet. He is Commander Pierce himself. He has silver hair, a
          moustache, and a much greater number of medals. He says in
          disbelief as he snatches the slip of paper:
           75.
                         
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo?
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
                          (VAGUELY)
           I couldn't say.
                         
          Commander Pierce shakes his head. He continues to study the
          document as he sits back down. Secretary McIntire begins to
          lather his cheeks with a brush.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A vast archway of wood, straw, and rope construction. Fort
          Lebanon is spelled out across the top with bound sticks. A
          large flag waving madly on a pole reads Khaki Scouts of North
          America. A bugler on a platform plays the familiar staccato
          tattoo. It echoes for miles.
                         
          Sam and Suzy wait inside the gates crouched behind a row of
          trash cans with the rest of the troop except Skotak. They
          shiver. Sam has on his back-pack. Suzy carries her suitcase.
          Gadge holds a tennis ball can.
                         
          A scout master in an Indian chief's headdress stops as he
          walks by. He looks curiously at Sam and especially Suzy. He
          says to Nickleby:
                         
                          GUARD SCOUT
           Who's your unit leader?
                         
          Pause. Nickleby points to a fat man in an apron cooking
          hamburgers on a grill.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           That guy.
                         
          The scout master shrugs. Skotak comes over and says
                         FURTIVELY:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           There's a broken gum-ball machine behind
           the snack tent.
                         
          Skotak distributes a handful of gum-balls among Sam, Suzy,
          and the rest of the troop. They all put them in their mouths.
          Skotak motions for everyone to follow him.
                         
          A footbridge across a stream leads to a Quonset hut with an
          awning in front labelled Supply Tent. A crowd of very young
          scouts waits at a wide counter bartering over boxes of food,
          drink, and equipment. A team of helpers collects money and
          packages goods. At the center, there is a twenty-year-old
           76.
                         
                         
          scout with a pencil behind his ear. He is Cousin Ben. He says
          to a nine-year-old Junior Khaki:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I don't care how they do it where you
           come from. You want pop? You want candy?
           You want a snake-bite kit? Get some
           money.
                         
          Skotak appears and whispers something to Cousin Ben. Cousin
          Ben nods. He says to his customers:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Come back in five minutes.
                         
          Cousin Ben pulls a curtain shut behind the counter.
                         
          EXT. WOODEN PROMENADE. DAY
                         
          Sam, Suzy, Skotak and the rest of the troop follow Cousin Ben
          briskly out a door and onto a cat-walk that runs along the
          top of a wall made from tall, pointed logs. As they talk,
          they walk past dozens of rows and clusters of tents grouped
          by color in the fields below. They walk past towers, huts,
          ladders, latrines, and a catapult under construction. They
          walk past a white infirmary with a red cross on it and a
          doctor taking a boy's blood pressure. They walk past a fleet
          of small, antique sailboats flying assorted troop banners.
          Five hundred scouts and fifty scout masters work, eat, talk,
          cook, and play sports and games all around the compound in
          spite of the fierce winds. One group rides motorcycles,
          another fires model rockets, another flies by overhead on a
          cable-trolley.
                         
          Cousin Ben points to Sam and asks Skotak over the sound of
                         THE WIND:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Is this him?
                         
                          SAM
           Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55,
           resigned.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the
           can?
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in
           nickels.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Give it to me.
           77.
                         
                         
          Skotak motions for Gadge to hand Cousin Ben the tennis ball
          can. It appears to be very heavy and jingles as it moves.
          Cousin Ben takes it. He says to Sam:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           You badge in seamanship?
                         
                          SAM
           Yes, sir.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has an
          anchor embroidered on it.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Good. There's cold-water crabber moored
           off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an
           I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as
           a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life,
           but it's better than shock therapy.
                         
                          SAM
           Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the
           chapel tent?
                         
          Cousin Ben hesitates. He points behind them with his thumb:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Back there, but the padre's home with the
           mumps. Why do you ask?
                         
                          SAM
           I want to bring my wife.
                         
          Cousin Ben stops walking. He looks Sam up and down. Suzy says
                         BEHIND HIM:
                         
                          SUZY
           But we're not married yet.
                         
          Cousin Ben turns to Suzy. He looks back to Sam and back to
          Suzy again.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           You his girl?
                         
          Suzy nods. Cousin Ben looks intrigued. He says tentatively:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener.
           I'm authorized to declare births, deaths,
           and marriages. You're kind of young. You
           got a license?
           78.
                         
                         
          Sam and Suzy shake their heads. Cousin Ben nods. He speaks
          more gently now:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I can't offer you a legally binding
           union. It won't hold up in the state, the
           county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the
           world due to your age, lack of a license,
           and failure to get parental consent --
           but the ritual does carry a very
           important moral weight within yourselves.
           You can't enter into this lightly. Do you
           love each other?
                         
          Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben continues:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Are you sure you're ready for this?
                         
          Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben looks perturbed.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Let me rephrase it.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           We're in a hurry.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
                          (SNAPPING)
           Spit out the gum, sister. In fact,
           everybody.
                         
          Cousin Ben puts out his hand. Suzy spits her gum into his
          palm. He throws it away over his shoulder. Sam and the rest
          of the troop spit their gum out on the ground. Cousin Ben
                         SAYS STERNLY:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I don't like the snappy attitude. This is
           the most important decision you've made
           in your lives. Now go over by that
           trampoline and talk it through before you
           give me another quick answer.
                         
          Cousin Ben watches as Sam and Suzy walk away and stand next
          to a large trampoline. A small scout jumps from a high
          ladder, bounces, and does a back-flip.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam and Suzy uncertain how to begin the conversation. Sam
          shrugs.
           79.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           I guess we better try to pretend we're
           struggling over our decision for a minute
           before we go back over there and tell him --
                         
                          SUZY
           Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake.
                         
          Sam looks stunned. He is speechless. He stammers:
                         
                          SAM
           What? Why? How?
                         
                          SUZY
           Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to
           me. It might be better to just go steady
           permanently.
                         
          Sam shakes his head. He looks off into the distance. He says
                         QUIETLY:
                         
                          SAM
           I don't know what to say.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Cousin Ben counting nickels in the tennis ball can. He jerks
          his thumb toward Sam and Suzy and says dismissively:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I guess they're probably just trying to
           pretend they're struggling over their
           decision, but at least --
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Woah!
                         
          Cousin Ben looks. Suzy has her hands around Sam's throat and
          is throttling him. Sam squirms loose and calms her down. The
          troop watches transfixed. Sam takes a snapshot out of his
          pocket and shows it to Suzy, explaining. Suzy nods. They come
          back over to the group. There are tears on Suzy's cheeks. She
          says to Cousin Ben:
                         
                          SUZY
           We're sure.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           OK. Let's do a blood test.
                         
          INT. CHAPEL TENT. DAY
                         
          Cousin Ben stands at a collapsible altar. He wears a purple,
          silk stole around his neck with crosses stitched into it. Sam
           80.
                         
                         
          and Suzy hold a Bible with their hands on it. Skotak and the
          rest of troop listen solemnly as Cousin Ben reads from a
                         MANUAL:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           -- which we hereby consecrate on this
           day, the fifth of September, 1965.
                          (LOOKING UP)
           That's the end of the short-form. Do any
           of the witnesses have objections or
           remarks? Usually, they don't.
                         
          Skotak raises his hand. Cousin Ben reluctantly calls on him:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Skotak.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried
           about their future.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
                          (OFFENDED)
           That's my fee.
                         
          Skotak and the rest of the troop look very concerned. They
          murmur to each other:
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           What's going to happen to them?
                         
                          GADGE
           Nobody knows.
                         
                          DELUCA
           Let's take a vote.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           All in favor --
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
                          (LOUDLY)
           That's my fee.
                         
          Skotak and the rest of the troop look to Cousin Ben. Cousin
          Ben glares at them. He sighs. He points to Skotak.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           You're just like your brothers. OK, give
           them the tennis ball can.
                         
          Cousin Ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to
          his feet. Skotak takes it and zips it into a side-pocket of
           81.
                         
                         
          Sam's back-pack. Cousin Ben hands Sam and Suzy a receipt on a
          clipboard.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Sign here -- and initial here and here.
                         
          Sam and Suzy sign and initial. Cousin Ben tears out a copy.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's
           go.
                         
          Sam and Suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding
          hands. They do not smile. Cousin Ben, Skotak, and the rest of
          the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces.
          Sam touches Suzy's hair. Suzy kisses Sam's hand. They walk as
          a group through the camp.
                         
                         OMIT
                         
          EXT. CAMP MARINA. DAY
                         
          Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop wait at the end
          of a narrow dock. Cousin Ben stands below them in a small
          sailboat. He reaches up to Suzy and lifts her onboard. He
          reaches up to Sam and lifts him onboard, too. He rigs the
          sail.
                         
          Sam smiles sadly. He and Skotak do the secret handshake. The
          others quickly join in. Suzy blows them a kiss. Everyone
          looks choked up.
                         
          Cousin Ben unloops a line. The sails quickly catch the strong
          wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor. Skotak and the
          rest of troop wave and salute. They watch, bittersweet.
          Pause.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           Where they going again?
                         
                          GADGE
           He's going to work on a shrimper, if I
           understand correctly.
                         
                          SKOTAK
                          (WISTFULLY)
           I wish them well.
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           Me, too. Me, too.
                         
          Skotak sighs. He turns and starts up the dock. The others
          follow him. Roosevelt hesitates. He points.
           82.
                         
                         
                          ROOSEVELT
           I think they're coming back.
                         
          Skotak and the rest of the troop stop and turn around. The
          sailboat glides back in. Sam leaps onto the dock with the
          tennis ball can. Suzy looks worried. Cousin Ben yells:

           chapel tent.

           Just leave them.
                         
          Sam sprints up the dock. He yells back over his shoulder:
                         
                          SAM
           We can't. It's her magic power!

          A binocular shot of Sam running full-speed through the
          compound. He approaches quickly -- then skids to a stop.
                         
          EXT. CHAPEL TENT. DAY
                         
          Redford blocks the entrance. He is dressed in white hospital
          pajamas with a red cross on the breast pocket. His side is
          heavily bandaged and his arm is attached to an I/V drip. He
          lowers Suzy's binoculars.
                         
          Sam stands frozen in front of Redford. Redford stares at him
          icily. Sam starts to say something -- then pauses. He says,
                         INSTEAD:
                         
                          SAM
           You killed your dog, by the way.

           Well, it couldn't be helped.
                         
          Sam nods. He asks quietly:
           83.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Why do you consider me your enemy?
                         
          Redford frowns. He says in disbelief:
                         
                          REDFORD
           Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the
           back with lefty scissors.
                         
                          SAM
           She's my wife now.
                         
                          REDFORD
           Congratulations.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago.
           From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm
           trying to understand.
                          (IN SUMMATION)
           Why don't you like me?

                          (LONG PAUSE)
           Why should I? Nobody else does.
                         
          Sam runs up to Redford and pokes him as hard as he can in the
          scissor cut with his finger. Redford screams.
                         
          Scouts and scout masters everywhere stop what they are doing
          and look to the chapel tent. Across the compound, Commander
          Pierce comes out of his tent, alerted.
                         
          Sam whips the binoculars out of Redford's hands, turns away,
          and sprints. No one moves anywhere except Sam dashing toward
          the marina. Redford shouts at the top of his lungs:
                         
                          REDFORD
           He's here! The fugitive! Stop him!
                         
          An emergency alarm sounds. The entire camp swings into
          action. Two teams of scouts playing capture-the-flag descend
          from both sides and cut Sam off from the dock. They wear red
          and yellow jerseys over their uniforms.
                         
          Suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock. Sam sees her beyond
          the blockade of scouts. She waves her arms. Sam throws up his
          hands. He sprints in a new direction, onto a wide field.
          There is a small, pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the
          ground at the center of a plastic ring. Sam grabs it as he
          runs past. He looks back and sees:
           84.
                         
                         
          A mob of fifty scouts chasing him. He circles in a giant
          figure eight trailed by the huge group. He races up a hill
          and stops at the top.
                         
          Sam looks down at the approaching scouts and hundreds of
          others watching. A dark cloud rolls in casting a giant shadow
          over the entire camp. Sam throws the little flag down at his
          pursuers like a javelin. It sails in an arc and pokes down
          into the grass. There is a thunderclap. Sam looks up into the
          sky.
                         
          A bolt of lightning strikes him.
                         
          Sam is thrown ten feet through the air and lands on his back.
          The tennis ball can explodes nickels. The mob of scouts stops
          with a jolt. They look terrified. Sam sits up. He is covered
          in black soot. His shoes are on fire. He shakes them off his
          feet.
                         
          Suzy runs through the crowd of scouts and drops down on her
          knees in front of Sam. She looks astonished. Sam says
                         QUICKLY:
                         
                          SAM
           I'm OK.
                         
          Suzy helps Sam to his feet. Sam raises Suzy's smoldering
          binoculars to his eyes. Skotak and the rest of the troop join
          them.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of a ladder leaning against a high fence.
                         SAM SHOUTS:
                         
                          SAM
           Follow me!
                         
          Sam leads Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop fly at a
          sprint to the fence, climb the ladder, and pull it up after
          them. A bugle plays a cavalry charge. The mob bolts after
          them.

          Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
          Scout Master Ward, and Becky wearing their operator head-
          phones. On the other side, we see Commander Pierce, Secretary
          McIntire, and the commander's entourage inside the command
          tent. Commander Pierce says into his field-telephone:

                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Stand by, Commander Pierce.
                         
          Captain Sharp spins around in his chair and flips a switch on
          a two-way radio. He says into a microphone:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP

                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Becky, notify the Bishops: Suzy's there.
                         
          Becky nods. Captain Sharp turns to Scout Master Ward.

          head-phones.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Affirmative. I'm on my way.
                         
          Becky plugs a cord into a socket and says:
                         
                          BECKY
           Hello! Mr. Bishop?
                         
          Captain Sharp looks out the window with a sense of dread.

           MR. BISHOP
           Oh, dear God.
                         
          Mr. Bishop grabs Mrs. Bishop by the wrist. He says grimly:

          Scout Master Ward steers his outboard through the open

          in waves. Scout Master Ward is drenched. He does not flinch
          or even appear to notice.

          the woods as fast as they can. There are flashes of lightning
          and pounding thunder. Suzy trips on a root, and Sam pulls her
          to her feet. Sam trips on a rock, and Suzy pulls him to his
          feet.

          Secretary McIntire says gravely:

           That's coming our way.
                         
          Captain Pierce nods, worried. The capture-the-flag scouts in
          soaking jerseys gather, winded, outside the tent. One of the
          team captains stands in the entrance breathing heavily.
          Commander Pierce points to him:

          Two young priests cross in the opposite direction carrying

          The entire brigade of scouts stands assembled in formation in
          the rain. The last two stragglers come running and hurry into
          their positions. They all wear rain slickers or canvas
          ponchos. Commander Pierce, Secretary McIntire, and the
          commander's entourage emerge quickly from the command tent.
          Commander Pierce shouts:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           Attention, company! Prepare for --
                         
          Commander Pierce hesitates. He points down to the marina and
          says to Secretary McIntire:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           Who's that?
                         
          Secretary McIntire and the commander's entourage turn to see:
                         
          Scout Master Ward speeding toward the dock in his motorboat.
          He leaps to shore, throws a line over a post, and sprints up
          to the assembly. He salutes Commander Pierce. Commander
          Pierce frowns and asks with quiet ferocity:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           You call yourself a Khaki Scout?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (HESITATES)
           I'm sorry, sir?
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
                          (ENRAGED)
           Where's your goddamn troop? They could
           get killed out there!
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (SURPRISED)
           You don't have them?
           89.
                         
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
                          (DISGUSTED)
           You're a liability to us.
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
                          (IN EXPLANATION)
           The incident may affect our insurance
           premiums.
                         
          Commander Pierce looks at Scout Master Ward's breast pocket.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A name-tag that reads Scout Master Ward next to a patch with
          a picture of a snow-capped mountain. It says K.S.N.A.
          Leadership underneath.
                         
          Commander Pierce says bitterly:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           I'm field-stripping you of your command.
                         
          Commander Pierce rips the patch off Scout Master Ward's
          uniform and throws it aside. He holds out his hand, palm up.
          Scout Master Ward looks stricken. He reaches into his pocket,
          takes out his scout pocket-knife, and hands it Commander
          Pierce. Commander Pierce puts it into his own pocket. He
                         SHOUTS:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           Attention, company! Prepare for emergency
           evacuation!
                         
          Secretary McIntire leans close to Commander Pierce. He
                         WHISPERS DISCREETLY:
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           Sir, do you have your medicine?
                         
          Commander Pierce hesitates. He holds up a finger.
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           I'll be right back.
                         
          Commander Pierce strides back into the command tent.
          Secretary McIntire looks to Scout Master Ward, uneasy. Scout
          Master Ward stares down at the ground.
                         
          The flash-flood explodes out from the woods.
                         
          Gushing water pours down the hillside, cuts a swath through
          the center of the camp, and tears down everything in its
          narrow path. The command tent suddenly becomes a tiny island
          at the center of a rushing river.
           90.
                         
                         
          The company is taken aback. Scout Master Ward stiffens,
          watchful. The totem pole creaks and sways, then falls cleanly
          onto the command tent, splitting it down the middle. Inside,
          something sparks, pops, then blows up. The tent bursts into
          flames.
                         
          Secretary McIntire does not react. He stands perfectly still,
          watching the fire. Scout Master Ward taps him, grabs him, and
          shakes him. Secretary McIntire looks at him blankly. Scout
          Master Ward makes a snap decision. He turns to the company
                         AND SHOUTS:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Hold your position!
                         
          Scout Master Ward runs ahead, splashes into the raging flood,
          wades through it against the current, dodging branches and
          debris, then pulls himself up onto the fallen totem pole and
          walks balancing on it to the burning tent. He disappears
          inside.
                         
          Secretary McIntire and the vast company watch, riveted.
                         
          Scout Master Ward comes out the opposite side of the tent
          onto the other end of the fallen totem pole carrying
          Commander Pierce over his shoulders. He descends back into
          the water, trudges through it, and steps up onto the
          embankment. The company looks deeply, permanently impressed.
          Scout Master Ward hollers:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Company Secretary! Status report, sir!
                         
          Secretary McIntire hesitates. He stirs to attention and says
                         ENTHUSIASTICALLY:
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           All accounted for, Scout Master!
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Supply and Resources! Call it out!
                         
          Cousin Ben gives an A-OK sign near the front of the assembly.
                         HE SHOUTS:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Affirmative, sir!
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Fall in! We're going to run for it, boys!
           Let's move!
                         
          The entire company follows Scout Master Ward with Commander
          Pierce over his shoulders at a fast jog out of the camp.
           91.
                         
                         
          INT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. DAY
                         
          The room has now been converted into a full-fledged refugee
          center. Families from the town-ship huddle in pews with bags
          and piles of their wet belongings. Priests and nuns
          distribute towels and sandwiches to frightened children. Dogs
          and cats prowl nervously. Sandbags are stacked in low walls
          outside the doors and windows. The rain beats on the roof,
          and lightning continues to flash through the stained glass.
                         
          A side door opens. Captain Sharp comes in from the storm with
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Lionel, Murray, Rudy, and the two old
          fishermen follow closely behind them. They slam the door.
          Captain Sharp looks around frantically.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Who's in charge here?
                         
          Another side door opens. Scout Master Ward jogs in with
          Commander Pierce still over his shoulders and the entire
          company behind him flooding into the room. Captain Sharp
          yells to him:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Randy! What happened?
                         
          Scout Master Ward goes over to Captain Sharp and turns his
          back to him, jogging in place.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Take the commander off of me.
                         
          Captain Sharp helps Commander Pierce down off Scout Master
          Ward's back and into a pew to rest. Secretary McIntire
          assists them. Mr. Bishop strides up the aisle yelling to the
          left and right:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Suzy? Sam?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           (shaking his head)
           They ran away again.
                         
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop grimace, unbelievably frustrated. Scout
          Master Ward addresses the scouts:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           We're going back out. I need volunteers.
                         
          Hands raise. Scout Master Ward passes out walkie-talkies as
          he chooses his squad:
           92.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You, you, you, you --
                         
          Becky steps in front of Scout Master Ward with her hand
          raised. Scout Master Ward hesitates.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           -- and you?
                         
          Becky takes a walkie-talkie. She looks at Scout Master Ward
          with admiration and asks, concerned:
                         
                          BECKY
           Are you all right?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (WARMLY)
           Of course, I am. Come on.
                         
          Scout Master Ward leads Becky by the arm through the crowded
          church as they begin to gather supplies: extra flashlights, a
          flare gun, coils of rope.
                         
          Captain Sharp looks up to the choir loft. Eleven children
          dressed in animal masks sit quietly in a row. Captain Sharp
          does a double-take. One of the animals is an otter wearing
          Sunday-school shoes and binoculars around its neck. Next to
          her is the male of the species in a sash with numerous small,
          embroidered patches on it.
                         
          The front doors open. There is lightning, thunder, wind, and
          rain. Social Services enters. She takes off a wet cape with a
          red lining and hands it to an acolyte in a robe. Jed presses
          the doors shut behind them. Social Services asks immediately:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Where's the boy?
                         
          Captain Sharp hesitates. He says reluctantly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           We don't know yet.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           That's not acceptable.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           (pretending to be irritated)
           What do you want me to say, lady?
           (to no one in particular)
           Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee.
                         
          The acolyte runs to the coffee dispenser with a cardboard
          cup. Social Services charges over to Captain Sharp.
           93.
                         
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           You're Captain Sharp?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           That's right.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy
           to your personal custody. You're
           responsible for his safety. I'm told he
           was just struck by lightning.
                         
          Captain Sharp frowns. He looks to Scout Master Ward and says
                         SKEPTICALLY:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           That's the first I heard of it.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (UNFORTUNATELY)
           It's true.
                         
          Captain Sharp tries to process this. Social Services now
          moves in on Scout Master Ward. She says aggressively:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Scout Master Ward, I presume?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Yes, ma'am.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (BITINGLY)
           Your reputation precedes you.
                         
          Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward stand side-by-side in
          front of Social Services. She berates them:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           You two are the most appallingly
           incompetent custodial guardians Social
           Services has ever had the misfortune to
                          ENCOUNTER --
                          (SHOUTING)
           -- in a twenty-seven year career!
                         
          Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward look sheepish. Social
          Services says bitterly:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           What do you have to say for yourselves?
                         
          Captain Sharp hesitates. He says strangely:
           94.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           You can't do this. They'll eat him alive
           in there.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (HESITATES)
           Where?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           (aside, to Scout Master Ward)
           What's the name of the place again?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (HESITATES)
           Juvenile refuge?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (HORRIFIED)
           Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail.
                         
          Silence. In the background, the acolyte picks up Panagle's
          walking stick weapon off the floor. He stares at it, puzzled.
          Social Services says carefully:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Just find the boy -- and deliver him --
           (motioning to herself)
           -- to Social Services. Nothing else is in
           your power.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (SHARPLY)
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Social Services, Captain Sharp, and Scout Master Ward turn to
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Mr. Bishop looks tense.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Can we get back to the rescue now?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (URGENTLY)
           Suzy's still out there.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (FROWNING)
           Who are you?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Walt and Laura Bishop. Their daughter's
           the missing girl.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           The parents of the stabber?
           95.
                         
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I object to that description. She was
           attacked.
                         
          Commander Pierce appears with an oxygen mask over his face.
          He pulls it aside briefly and says to Secretary McIntire:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           I want the details. Where's the scout she
           knifed?
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           Right here.
                         
          Secretary McIntire snaps his fingers and gives a signal.
          Redford appears.
                         
                          REDFORD
           Field Mate Redford, sir.
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           (through the oxygen mask)
           What's his condition?
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           He may suffer some limited chronic kidney
           insufficiency. Here's the report.
                         
          Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce a doctor's report.
          Mrs. Bishop snatches it and throws it over her shoulder.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           We don't have time for this!
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           She's right!
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Let's go!
                         
          Social Services turns and starts up the aisle. She stops
          suddenly. Captain Sharp is standing in their path brandishing
          Panagle's walking stick weapon.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Nobody's going anywhere.
                         
          Everyone stops. Captain Sharp locks eyes with Social
          Services. He says in a steely voice:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           He's not getting shock therapy.
           96.
                         
                         
          Social Services looks furious. Her jaw sets. She reaches
          inside her jacket and withdraws a small pad labelled Citation
          Book.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           That's it! I'm citing you for gross
           misconduct! You are hereby summoned to
           appear before the board of --
                         
          Captain Sharp looks enraged. He grits his teeth. He reaches
          into his back pocket and withdraws a similar pad labelled
          Boating Violations.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I'm writing you up back! Be notified that
           you stand accused of the mistreatment and
                          IMPROPER --
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (SCREAMING)
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (SCREAMING)
           I won't let you do it!
                         
                          REDFORD
                          (SCREAMING)
           Look!
                         
          Everyone looks. Redford is standing on a pew with his arm
          stretched out pointing up at the choir loft in amazement. The
          troop is there, but Sam's and Suzy's seats are empty.
                         
          There is a flash, a bang, and all the lights in the room go
          out at once. People gasp. Candles flicker alight on
          candlesticks. A back-up generator kicks into gear, humming,
          and the room fills with a new, different light.
                         
          Captain Sharp says to himself:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           They're gone.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (CONFUSED)
           Who?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (UNCERTAIN)
           Suzy?
           97.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (YELLING)
           Sam?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (SHOUTING)
           Gadge! Lazy-eye! Skotak!
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (REALIZING)
           They're here?
                         
          Captain Sharp strides down the aisle. He shouts up to Skotak:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Where'd they go? Answer me!
                         
          Skotak hesitates. He and the rest of the troop all look up to
          a small, rickety, attic door. It is slightly ajar above a
          long, narrow ladder behind the pipes of the organ.
                         
          Captain Sharp bolts up the steps. Everyone follows him,
          running.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT
                         
          The storm rages. Captain Sharp opens a trap door onto the
          high eaves. Faces appear in numerous windows below, looking
          up. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop poke their heads out behind Captain
          Sharp. On the far end of the rooftop, Sam and Suzy huddle
          together at the base of the high steeple.
                         
          Captain Sharp stares up at Sam and Suzy, dumbstruck.
                         
          Sam and Suzy quickly start climbing a rusty gutter up the
          side of the steeple. Captain Sharp looks astonished. He
                         HOLLERS:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Halt! Stop!
                         
          Sam and Suzy continue to climb. Captain Sharp shouts back to
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop over the roaring wind:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Stay there!
                         
          Scout Master Ward appears and thrusts out the coil of rope.
          He yells to Captain Sharp:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Take this!
           98.
                         
                         
          Captain Sharp throws the rope over his shoulder and advances.
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both crawl out after him, but Scout
          Master Ward pulls them back. Mr. Bishop looks to Mrs. Bishop.
          They are both terrified and helpless. They hold on to each
          other tightly.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Captain Sharp tight-rope-walking along the edge of the
          slippery roof with his arms stretched out sideways,
          balancing. He army-crawls up steep slate shingles and reaches
          the bottom of the steeple. He looks up. Sam and Suzy have
          arrived at the top. They inch away sideways around a ledge
          and disappear to the other side. Captain Sharp's voice
                         STRAINS:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Where you going? What are you doing? Come
           down!
                         
          Captain Sharp rubs his eyes. He knots one end of the rope
          around his waist and ties the other to a pipe at the foot of
          the gutter. He pulls the rope tight, presses his foot on the
          wall, and gets ready to start climbing -- then stops
          suddenly. He hesitates. He pulls the walkie-talkie off his
          belt and yells into it:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Social Services? Do you read me? Over!
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam and Suzy at the top of the steeple standing with their
          backs against a painted cross. They look out.
                         
          The entire church has become an island. The cemetery is under
          water, and the circling streets are fast rivers. Suzy turns
          to Sam. They both appear relatively calm.
                         
                          SUZY
           We might have to swim for it.
                         
                          SAM
           How deep is it? I didn't bring my life
           jacket.
                         
                          SUZY
           I don't know, but if it's too shallow,
           we'll break our necks, anyway. Hang onto
           me.
                         
                          SAM
           OK.
           99.
                         
                         
          Sam and Suzy link arms.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Captain Sharp climbing the steeple as Social Services yells
          at him over the speaker of his walkie-talkie:
                         
           SOCIAL SERVICES (V.O.)
           Application denied! I'm sorry! Over!
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           Counsellors? What's the legal
           perspective? Over!
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop watching from the trap door with Scout
          Master Ward. Mr. Bishop's eyes widen. He turns quickly to
          Mrs. Bishop. She nods, energized. Mr. Bishop grabs Scout
          Master Ward's walkie-talkie and shouts forcefully:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           In this state? I would litigate with
           extreme confidence.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (ABSOLUTELY)
           I concur.

                         CUT TO:
                         
          Social Services' face, inscrutable, as she listens.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam and Suzy preparing to jump. They each take a deep breath.
                         
                          SUZY
           On three again.
                         
                          SAM
                          (SUDDENLY)
           Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, or
                          (MORE)
           100.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           they capture us, and we never see each
           other again anymore -- thank you for
           marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you,
           Suzy.
                         
          Suzy looks deeply moved. She kisses Sam. A little electric
          zap crackles at their lips. Suzy's eyes widen.
                         
                          SUZY
           I think you've still got lightning in
           you.
                         
                          SAM
           Let's jump.
                         
          Sam and Suzy look down at the water again. Captain Sharp's
          voice screams from off-screen:
                         
           CAPTAIN SHARP (O.S.)
           No!
                         
          Sam and Suzy recoil. Captain Sharp appears, clinging to the
          corner of the ledge. He shouts:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Goddammit!
                         
          Sam and Suzy retreat slightly. Captain Sharps waves his hands
          in surrender. He yells into the walkie-talkie:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Tell him! Over!
                         
          Captain Sharp holds out the walkie-talkie. Social Services
          voice comes over the scratchy speaker once more. She shouts:
                         
           SOCIAL SERVICES (V.O.)
           Captain Sharp is offering to assume the

          Scout Master Ward watching from the trap door with Mr. and
          Mrs. Bishop. He says excitedly into his walkie-talkie:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           He wants you to live with him!

          Social Services watching from an attic window. She says
          softly into her own walkie-talkie:

          Sam staring at Captain Sharp. Captain Sharp says hopefully:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What do you think, pal?
                         
          Tears stream down Sam's cheeks in the rain. He looks to Suzy.
          She nods. She holds Sam's hand, and Sam reaches out to take
          Captain Sharp's. Captain Sharp says into the walkie-talkie:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           We're coming down! Over and out.

          Inside the church. The congregation listens on another walkie-
          talkie. They are all just about to burst into a cheer -- when
          there is a second, brighter flash followed by a much louder
          bang and then a terrible, thunderous, ripping explosion. The
          lights go out again. Everyone screams.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT
                         
          Scout Master Ward, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop, and Social Services
          stare with their mouths open in frozen horror. The entire
          steeple has disappeared. Only a twisted stump remains. Off
          the edge of the roof, at the end of the rope, dangling in the
          rain, Captain Sharp hangs swinging with Sam's hand in his
          fist and Suzy's in Sam's. Voices shout in a panic above. Sam
          and Suzy look up at Captain Sharp. He says to them evenly,
          swaying above the rushing water:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Don't let go.

          Three days later. The detached steeple of the church lies on
          its side on the roof of a smashed Volkswagen. The ground is
          covered with strewn branches and trash. Sandbags still
          surround the building. The narrator stands in front of the
          wreckage and addresses the camera:

          A basketball backboard sticks up out of nine feet of standing

          rowboat floating alongside it.

          An enormous neon ace-of-spades with the word Open spelled in
          broken light-bulbs above it is jammed sideways into a sandy
          beach. Brightly painted wooden planks are littered
          everywhere. The black lighthouse remains intact in the
          background. The narrator, now tiny in the frame, continues:

           Scout Master's log. October tenth.
           Reconstruction continues increasingly
           ahead of schedule, which I attribute to a
           particularly robust esprit de corps among
           the troop. The latrine, however,
           continues to present --
                         
          Scout Master Ward notices Skotak and a young boy with glasses
          standing in the doorway. He says, off-mic:

          Scout Master Ward presses stop on his tape recorder and leads
          Skotak and the young boy out of the tent. The narrator

          The narrator lingers for a moment, looking into the camera --
          then turns away and walks down the hillside.

           So you see, the composer Benjamin Britten
           has taken the whole orchestra apart. Now

          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy lie on the floor on their stomachs,
          propped up with their chins on their fists. They listen.
                         
          Suzy sits in a small armchair reading a book called The
          Return of Auntie Lorraine. There is an illustration on the
          cover of a leathery, old woman and a girl with a pony-tail
          looking together into a crystal ball. The kitten scratches at
          Suzy's feet.
                         
          Sam sits on a stool painting a picture at the small easel. He
          wears a miniature version of Captain Sharp's short-sleeved
          uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop's amplified voice booms from the bottom of the
                         STAIRS:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Suzy? Lionel, Murray, Rudy! Dinner!
                         
          Sam starts. Lionel, Murray, and Rudy look up from the record
          player. Suzy is impassive. Mr. Bishop's voice takes over the
                         MEGAPHONE:
                         
           MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Don't make us ask twice!
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy jump to their feet and race down the
          stairs. Sam dashes to the window. He opens it, climbs out,
          and disappears. Suzy closes her book and rises to her feet.
          Sam's head pokes back up from below. He and Suzy lock eyes.
                         
          Sam smiles. He whispers to Suzy urgently:
                         
                          SAM
           See you tomorrow.
                         
          Suzy smiles back. Sam ducks away. Suzy goes over to the
          window and looks out with her binoculars.

          A binocular shot of Sam dropping to the ground and running
          across the back lawn, into the trees. He comes out on the
          dirt road where Captain Sharp waits, sitting on the hood of
          his station wagon, smoking a cigarette. They both get into
          the car and drive off.

          Suzy lowers the binoculars. She pauses in front of the easel
          and looks at the picture. She walks quietly away down the
          stairs. The kitten follows her. The record continues to play
          on the empty landing.
                         
          The camera moves in toward Sam's painting on the easel. It is
          a watercolor landscape of Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. The tent is
          pitched on the beach, and Sam's and Suzy's clothes hang on
          the clothesline. Written in the sand with seashells just at
          the water's edge are the words:

               INT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY

               Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on 
               end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end 
               in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.

               We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products 
               calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is 
               November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been 
               penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica 
               counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter, 
               in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat 
               red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE 
               WHITE BACKGROUND.

                                        MOONSTRUCK

               Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low 
               TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.

                                     ZITO'S VOICE
                              (barely discernable)
                         Three times they cancel the order 
                         with me, and three times they come 
                         back. Who they kidding? They cheap, 
                         cheap, cheap. The other bread they 
                         get is no good. They save pennies. 
                         Everybody complain and they come 
                         back. "Zito, your bread is the best." 
                         They're like children stupid in school 
                         who cannot learn. The water. It's 
                         the water. You buy bread in Hoboken, 
                         you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water 
                         is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask 
                         your father. He knows.

               During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE 
               DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently 
               with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the 
               pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.

               NOW WE SEE ZITO

               He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's 
               early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, 
               so he's a little tired and disgruntled.

                                     ZITO
                         You want me to make you some coffee?

               NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME

               She's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is 
               Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked 
               with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes 
               of a dark color.

                                     LORETTA
                         What d'you know about coffee? Gimme 
                         a loaf of bread.

               EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY

               Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping 
               satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She 
               moves off briskly.

               EXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY

               This is a little Italian funeral parlor.

               INT. THE "WAKE" ROOM"

               A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes, 
               many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front, 
               the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and 
               formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We 
               discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises.

               She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over 
               and says.

                         That Al Conti is a genius.

               INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR

               First WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO 
               CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE.

                                     CONTI'S VOICE
                         I am a genius.

               The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half 
               cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming 
               mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's 
               tabulations.

                                     LORETTA'S VOICE
                         If you're such an artistic genius, 
                         why can't you keep track of your 
                         receipts? How am I going to do your 
                         income tax?

                                     CONTI'S VOICE
                         I am an artistic genius.

               The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta 
               sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of 
               coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering 
               figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger.

                                     LORETTA
                         If you're an artistic genius, how 
                         come you got butter on your tie?

               He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss.

                                     LORETTA
                         Give it here. I'll give you this, 
                         Al, you make good coffee.

               She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has 
               taken off, and slams the ledger shut.

               INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL

               We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They 
               are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall 
               starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes 
               are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is 
               ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. 
               He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, 
               heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that 
               Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a 
               ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. 
               After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something 
               to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and

               INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

               WE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.

               Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping 
               block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits, 
               unskinned.

               INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY

               A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the 
               FLORIST'S VOICE.

                                     FLORIST'S VOICE
                         Red roses. Very romantic. The man 
                         who sends these knows what he's doing.

               Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the 
               box of roses.

                                     LORETTA
                         The man who sends those spends a lot 
                         of money on something that ends up 
                         in the garbage can.

               The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.

                                     FLORIST
                         I'm glad everybody ain't like you, 
                         Loretta. I'd be outta business.

                                     LORETTA
                         Without me, you'd be out of business. 
                         I like flowers.

               She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first 
               time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of 
               her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red 
               rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A red neon sign hangs in the window.

               It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A 
               YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested 
               in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.

               INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

               White tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the 
               door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That's because 
               they're all related. The place is about half full, and bustles 
               along pleasantly.

               MUSIC

               A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.

               MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.

               They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is 
               Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is 
               impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens 
               to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a 
               pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a 
               mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is 
               Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked 
               with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and 
               high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.

               Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who 
               hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.

               Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she 
               watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.

               BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their 
               order.

                                     BOBO
                         Are you ready?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

                                     BOBO
                         Very good, Mr. Johnny.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         We will both have the Salad Ticino.

                                     BOBO
                         Uh-huh

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         And I'll have the special fish.

                                     LORETTA
                         You don't want the fish.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         No?

                                     LORETTA
                         It's the oily fish tonight. Not before 
                         the plane ride.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Maybe you're right.

                                     LORETTA
                         Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, 
                         too.

                                     BOBO
                         Yes, Miss Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                              (to Mr. Johnny)
                         That will give you a base. For your 
                         stomach. You eat that oily fish, you 
                         go up in the air, halfway to Sicily 
                         you'll be green and your hands will 
                         be sweating.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                              (smiles)
                         You look after me.

               They HEAR a distinguished MAN'S VOICE rise out of the babble.

               They turn and look. The man's name is PERRY.

               PERRY AND PATRICIA FROM LORETTA'S POV

               Perry is a university professor. PATRICIA is his 
               girlfriend/student. He's in his 50's. She's about 25 years 
               younger. She's getting her coat on in a huff.

                                     PERRY
                         Patricia, please don't go!

                                     PATRICIA
                         What do you think I am, a talking 
                         dog?

                                     PERRY
                         I was just making a point about the 
                         way you said... the way you stated 
                         your aspirations.

                                     PATRICIA
                         You can kiss my aspirations! 
                         Professor!

               She storms out, leaving Perry muttering to himself.

                                     PERRY
                         Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever. 
                         The height of cleverness. Waiter!

               An abnormally SHY WAITER stops.

                                     SHY WAITER
                         Yes?

                                     PERRY
                         Could you do away with her dinner, 
                         and any evidence of her, and bring 
                         me an big glass of vodka?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         But absolutely!

               THE SHY WAITER begins to efficiently clear.

               MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA EXCHANGE A GLANCE

               Mr. Johnny is amused. Bobo serves them their salad.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         A man who can't control his woman is 
                         funny.

                                     LORETTA
                         She was too young for him.

               Mr. Johnny considers this a point well taken.

               BOBO AND HIS NEPHEW EDDIE STAND NEAR THE KITCHEN

               Which can be seen through a serving window. They can look 
               out over the restaurant tables. Bobo is melancholy and 
               philosophical. EDDIE is a young waiter.

                                     EDDIE
                         What'samatter, Uncle Bobo?

                                     BOBO
                         Tonight Mr. Johnny's gonna propose 
                         marriage.

                                     EDDIE
                         How you know that?

                                     BOBO
                         He arranged it with me. When he asks 
                         her, then he'll wave to me and I'll 
                         bring champagne. Good bachelor 
                         customer for twenty years. But who 
                         knows? Maybe he'll lose courage.

                                     EDDIE
                         Heavy duty stuff.

               PERRY, FEELING NO PAIN, COLLARS THE SHY WAITER

               He holds out his empty glass.

                                     PERRY
                         Can I get another one of these?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         Definitely!

               Perry takes his arm.

                                     PERRY
                         May I presume to ask you a question?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         Sure!

                                     PERRY
                         Do you have a girlfriend?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         I am alone in the world.

               Perry lets go of his arm. He and the Shy Waiter commiserate 
               a moment. Then, wordlessly, the Shy Waiter goes.

                                     PERRY
                         That's very sad.

               BOBO IS CLEARING THE REMAINS OF MR. JOHNNY'S DINNER. He's 
               already cleared Loretta's.

                                     BOBO
                         How's things?

                                     LORETTA
                         Fine, Bobo. We'll take the check.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         No, I want to see the dessert cart.

                                     BOBO
                         Very good.

               Bobo goes. Loretta is surprised.

                                     LORETTA
                         You never have dessert.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Never is a long time.

               Mr. Johnny is uneasy. He massages his head.

                                     LORETTA
                         What's the matter?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         My scalp is not getting enough blood 
                         sometimes.

               Loretta looks at him strangely. Bobo rolls up the dessert 
               cart. WE SEE Loretta and Mr. Johnny through the frame of the 
               dessert cart. They turn and look at the desserts.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Have Something.

                                     LORETTA
                         I shouldn't.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Will you marry me?

                                     LORETTA
                         What?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Will you marry me?

                                     LORETTA
                         Bobo, take the cart away.

               He does.

                                     LORETTA
                              (continuing)
                         Are you proposing marriage to me?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Yes?

                                     LORETTA
                         You know I was married and that my 
                         husband died. But what you don't 
                         know is I think he and I had Bad 
                         Luck.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         What do you mean?

                                     LORETTA
                         We got married at the City Hall and 
                         I think it gave bad luck the whole 
                         marriage.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't understand.

                                     LORETTA
                         Right from the start we didn't do it 
                         right. Could you kneel down?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         On the floor?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yes, on the floor.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         This is a good suit.

                                     LORETTA
                         I helped you buy it. It came with 
                         two pairs of pants. It's for luck, 
                         Johnny. When you propose marriage to 
                         a woman, you should kneel down.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Alright.

               Mr. Johnny slowly gets out of his chair. There's not enough 
               room for him to kneel down. He has to ask two off-duty PRO 
               WRESTLERS who are eating dinner to move their chairs. They 
               do so with bemused expressions. Their names are BOB and MOOK.

                         A ring. That's right.

                         You could use your pinky ring.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I like this ring.

                         You propose to a woman you should 
                         offer her a ring of engagement.

               Mr. Johnny takes off the ring and holds it out to her.

               She meekly accepts the ring from him and takes his hands.

               Mr. Johnny slowly stands up, brushes off his knees. The 
               restaurant has fallen utterly silent. Loretta smiles. They 
               embrace. Loretta kisses him quickly.

               Bobo stands very near her table. She is about to applaud the

               out and neatly captures her hands before they can part again. 
               The single sound dies abruptly in the silent room.

                         When I was twenty-seven years old, 
                         in Jersey City, I asked a woman to 
                         marry me. She had red hair. She 
                         smelled a jasmine. She wore black 
                         shoes with pointy white tips.

                         She didn't hear me. She asked me to 
                         repeat, so she could understand what 
                         I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. 
                         Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.

                         the plane in plenty of time.

               Mr. Johnny puts on his coat.

                         This is the last call for 
                         International Flight Number Six-ohfour 
                         boarding at Gate Twenty-six for Rome 
                         and Palermo.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I've got to go.

               He clumsily kisses her. Then he quickly turns and leaves.

               She waves, but he doesn't look back.

               EXT AIRPORT RUNWAY - NIGHT

               Close shot on plane's wheels and under belly as it slowly 
               begins to move. Red lights are flashing.

               AN OLD ITALIAN CRONE IS LOOKING OUT THE TERMINAL WINDOW

               In the background we see the accordion like ramp that was 
               loading to the departing aircraft, slowly fold up. Loretta 
               walks up beside her, and looks out the window, too. The crone 
               is dressed in black and has a black scarf on her head.

               The Crone notices Loretta.

                                     CRONE
                         Do you have someone on that plane?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yeah.
                              (smiles)
                         My fiancé.

                                     CRONE
                         I have put a curse on that plane. My 
                         sister is on that plane. I have put 
                         a curse on that plane that it should 
                         explode. Burn on fire and fall into 
                         the sea. Fifty years ago she stole a 
                         man from me. Today she told me that 
                         she didn't even love him. She took 
                         him to feel strong with me. Now she 
                         goes back to Sicily. I have cursed 
                         her that the green Atlantic water 
                         should swallow her up.

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't believe in curses.

                                     CRONE
                              (smiles)
                         Neither do I.

               The plane takes off. Loretta looks after it anxiously. All 
               her hopes are on that plane.

               INT. A PARKING GARAGE IN LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT

               The LTD pulls into the entrance and Loretta gets out. An 
               ATTENDANT appears.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Mr. Johnny's, right?

                                     LORETTA
                         Right. The key's in it.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Good night.

                                     LORETTA
                         Night.

               Loretta walks of into the night.

               EXT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

               Camera frames the window with a sweetheart in neon.

               EXT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

               Loretta walks up the street and enters the store.

               INT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

               Loretta walks in. IRV and LOTTE, the middle-aged couple who 
               own and run the place, are having an argument.

                                     LOTTE
                         I've seen how you look at her and it 
                         isn't right.

                                     IRV
                         How do I look at her?
                              (to Loretta)
                         Can I help you?

                                     LORETTA
                         A split of Moet.

                                     LOTTE
                              (to IRV)
                         Like a wolf.

                                     IRV
                              (getting the split)
                         Like a wolf, huh? You never seen a 
                         wolf in your life.

                                     IRV
                              (to Loretta)
                         That's seven-fifty-seven.

               Loretta pays and waits for her change.

                                     LOTTE
                         I seen a wolf in everybody I ever 
                         met and I see a wolf in you.

                                     IRV
                              (giving the change)
                         That makes ten. Thanks. Have a nice 
                         night.

                                     LORETTA
                         You, too.

               Loretta walks out.

                                     IRV
                         You know what I see in you, Lotte?

                                     LOTTE
                         What?

                                     IRV
                         The girl I married.

               Lotte, caught off-guard, blushes.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               It's a big, old eccentric, three-story corner house. To one 
               side, it's got a qated arch that leads to an inner courtyard 
               where three cars could park. It's got two cast-iron balconies. 
               About a third of the windows in the house are lit.

               From within can be HEARD the faint strains of VICKI CARR 
               SINGING and one DOG BARKING. Loretta appears, carrying 
               champagne, approaches the front door, unlocks it, and goes 
               in.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

               MUSIC

               VICKI CARR is SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM."

               The front hall is typical of big old brownstones. There's a 
               big old oak coat rack with a built-in mirror and an umbrella 
               stand. There are several coats hanging from it. The floor is 
               littered with boots. There's also a side table.

               On the table is a large cut-glass bowl filled with a couple 
               of pounds of hard candy.

               Loretta comes in and takes off her coat. A single MAD HOWL 
               is HEARD, followed by a PANDEMONIUM OF BARKING. FIVE DOGS 
               charge into the hall to greet Loretta. They are totally 
               cockeyed, crackpot mutts. Their names are JUDAS, LUCY, LEO 
               FATBOY, AND JONES.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hello, boys and girls. Guess what 
                         happened to me?

               The VOICE of the OLD MAN is heard calling out from upstairs.

                                     OLD MAN'S VOICE
                         How long must I wait? Quanto tempo 
                         devo aspettare?

               The Five Dogs turn away from Loretta and charge up the stairs 
               toward the voice. Loretta walks toward the living room.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               This is the source of the Vicki Carr song, which is just 
               ending. COSMO CASTORINI, Loretta's father is just turning 
               off the old stereo. He is a powerful man, about 65, with a 
               huge shock of white hair and gold wire glasses. He's wearing 
               a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas, and royal blue 
               slippers. The room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture, 
               once grand, now threadbare; shawls and doilies cover holes 
               in failing fabric. There's a fireplace containing a dying 
               fire. Cosmo's wing chair, with his newspaper on it, is beside 
               a lit fringed lamp. Cosmo sees Loretta as she comes in.

                                     COSMO
                         Hi.

               He sits in his chair and puts his feet up on an old 
               needlepoint ottoman. He starts to read the paper.

                                     LORETTA
                         Where's Ma?

                                     COSMO
                         Bed.

                                     LORETTA
                         You're not sleepy?

                                     COSMO
                         I can't sleep anymore. It's too much 
                         like death.

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop, I got news.

               Cosmo puts down the paper and takes his feet off the ottoman.

                                     COSMO
                         Alright. Let's go in the kitchen.

               Cosmo gets up and heads for the kitchen. He hums and continues 
               as Loretta opens champagne.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Loretta and Cosmo sit at the kitchen table. It's a big tin 
               table with a black-and-white design. Loretta has put two old- 
               fashioned champagne glasses on the table, the split of 
               champagne, a bag of sugar cubes, and a bottle of bitters.

               She pours the champagne, drops a little lump of sugar into 
               each glass, and adds a dash of bitters. She hands one of the 
               drinks to Cosmo.

                                     LORETTA
                         Here.

                         Ti amo.
                              (Translated: I love 
                              you.)

                         You look tired.

                         What's your news?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm getting married.

                                     COSMO
                         Again?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yeah.

                                     COSMO
                         You did this once it didn't work 
                         out.

                                     LORETTA
                         The guy died.

                                     COSMO
                         What killed him?

                                     LORETTA
                         He got hit by a bus.

                                     COSMO
                         No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been 
                         married fifty-two years an nobody 
                         died. You were married, what, two 
                         years, and somebody is dead. Don't 
                         get married again, Loretta. It don't 
                         work out for you. Who's the man?

                                     LORETTA
                         Johnny Cammareri.

                                     COSMO
                         Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he 
                         here with you telling me?

                                     LORETTA
                         He's flying to Sicily. His mother's 
                         dying.

                                     COSMO
                         More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, 
                         Loretta. I don't like his lips. When 
                         he smiles I can't see his teeth. 
                         When will you do it?

                                     LORETTA
                         In a month.

                                     COSMO
                         I won't come.

                                     LORETTA
                         You've got to come. You've got to 
                         give me away.

                                     COSMO
                         I didn't give you away the first 
                         time.

                                     LORETTA
                         And maybe that's why I had the Bad 
                         Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and 
                         I got married in a church, in a 
                         wedding dress, instead of at the 
                         City Hall with strangers standing 
                         outside the door, maybe then I 
                         wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.

                                     COSMO
                         Maybe.

                                     LORETTA
                         I didn't have no wedding cake, no 
                         reception or nothing. Johnny got 
                         down on his knees and proposed to me 
                         at The Grand Ticino.

                                     COSMO
                         He did?

                         Yeah.

                                     COSMO
                         That don't sound like Johnny. Where's 
                         the ring?

               Loretta shows it.

               Cosmo examines it.

                                     LORETTA
                         Here.

                                     COSMO
                         It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. 
                         It's a man's ring.

                                     LORETTA
                         It's temporary.

                                     COSMO
                         Everything is temporary. That don't 
                         excuse nothing.

                                     LORETTA
                         So you'll come to the wedding, right?

                                     COSMO
                         Let's go tell your Mother.

               She smiles. He doesn't. They rise from the table.

               THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DARKENED MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The door to the hall opens, and the light from without dimly 
               illuminates a massive four-poster bed. Cosmo enters, followed 
               by Loretta. He speaks into the dark a calm and measured 
               summons.

                                     COSMO
                         Rose. Rose. Rose. Rose.

               A lamp is switched on by the bed. By ROSE. Rose is in her 
               60'S, and is very, very beautiful. Her abundant white tresses 
               frame a face of porcelain delicacy.

               She's wearing an old and richly beautiful white nightgown.

                                     ROSE
                         Who's dead?

                                     COSMO
                         Nobody. Loretta is getting married.

                                     ROSE
                         Again? Johnny Cammareri.

               Cosmo goes and sits on the bed.

                                     COSMO
                         I don't like him.

                                     ROSE
                         You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. 
                         Do you love him, Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         No.

                                     ROSE
                         Good. When you love them they drive 
                         you crazy cause they know they can. 
                         But you like him?

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna 
                         have a big church wedding, Ma. And a 
                         reception.

                                     ROSE
                         And who's gonna pay for that?

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop.

                                     COSMO
                         WHAT?

               Rose starts laughing.

                                     LORETTA
                         Father of the bride pays.

               Cosmo walks out.

                                     COSMO
                         I have no money!

                                     ROSE
                         You're rich as Roosevelt. You're 
                         just cheap, Cosmo.

               Cosmo shouts from the stairs.

                                     COSMO
                         I won't pay for nothing.

                                     ROSE
                         He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks 
                         if he holds on to his money, he will 
                         never die.

                                     LORETTA
                         It's his duty as a father to pay for 
                         my wedding, Ma ...

               MUSIC

               VICKI CARR, SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM", starts playing. Rose 
               looks weary.

                                     ROSE
                         Now he's gonna play that damn Vicki 
                         Carr record. And then when he comes 
                         to bed, he won't touch me.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - MORNING

               The first golden rays of sunlight touch the great old house.

               The front door opens. Close shot of dogs coming into camera 
               as door opens. The OLD MAN comes out. The Old Man, who is 
               Cosmo's father, is 83 years old. He is taking the Five Dogs 
               out for their morning walk. He has their five leashes bundled 
               in one hand. In the other hand, even though it is a cloudless 
               November morning, he open black umbrella. He walks off down 
               the block with the dogs.

               EXT. A SMALL CITY PARK SURROUNDED BY HURRICANE FENCE - DAY

               The Old Man and the Five Dogs appear and enter the park. He 
               approaches a park bench where FELIX and LUCY are already 
               sitting. Felix and Lucy are about the same age as the Old 
               Man. They each have a well-behaved DOG. When the Old Man 
               sits down, he lets the Five Dogs go. The Dogs run off, BARKING 
               like mad.

                                     FELIX
                         It's wrong to just let them go.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (ignoring Felix)
                         Good morning, Lucy.

                                     LUCY
                         Good morning.

                                     FELIX
                         They run around, they mess up the 
                         whole park.

                                     OLD MAN
                         What do you want me to do? Pick up 
                         after five dogs? I'm eighty-three 
                         years old. God in his heaven 
                         understands that I cannot pick up 
                         after five dogs.

                                     FELIX
                         You have too many dogs.

               The dogs can be HEARD in the distance. It sounds like they're 
               killing each other.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (goes back to ignoring 
                              Felix)
                         Lucy. There are big things going on 
                         in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, 
                         the only daughter of my son Cosmo, 
                         has engaged herself to be married a 
                         second time.

                                     LUCY
                         I have heard that Johnny Cammareri 
                         got down on his knees in The Grand 
                         Ticino and proposed to her.

                                     OLD MAN
                         My son does not like this Johnny 
                         Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.

                                     FELIX
                         You should have one dog. Like Lucy. 
                         Like me. I wish I hadda gun. If I 
                         hadda gun, I would shoot four of 
                         your dogs.

               The Old Man makes a low, threatening noise.

                                     LUCY
                         Don't fight.

                                     OLD MAN
                         My granddaughter wants my son to pay 
                         for the wedding. But he does not 
                         want to pay.

                                     LUCY
                         He should pay.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I don't know.

                                     LUCY
                         He owes her a wedding from the first 
                         time when there was none.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked 
                         my advice. If he asks my advice, I 
                         don't know what I will say.

               The SOUND of the DOGS becomes intense again.

                                     FELIX
                         I won't have to shoot those dogs. 
                         They will kill each other.

                                     OLD MAN
                         You think so, huh, Stupid? Those 
                         dogs love each other.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

               The gates in the big archway are opened from the inside.

               It's Cosmo. He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an 
               overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black 
               Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he 
               gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and 
               goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man 
               approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.

               The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.

               Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and 
               son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective 
               door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the 
               same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.

               Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears 
               within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               A RED-HOT, WELL-SEASONED CAST IRON FRYING PAN

               Receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of 
               satisfaction. A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around 
               until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread 
               with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.

               Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula 
               flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the 
               cooked side.

               Two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in 
               the bread.

               The circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula, 
               scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs.

               A WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash 
               of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results 
               from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates.

               Now WE SEE that Loretta is just finishing setting the tin 
               table for two. In the b.g., Rose is turning away from the 
               big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled 
               coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes 
               toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a 
               nice old apron over a blue housedress. She's thoughtful.

               As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work 
               shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As 
               Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta, 
               who's at the stove.

                                     ROSE
                         Will you live here?

                                     LORETTA
                         No.

                                     ROSE
                         Why not?

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop don't like Johnny.

               Loretta returns with the coffeepot to the table, and pours.

               Then she takes the pot back to the stove.

                                     ROSE
                         So we'll sell the house.

                                     LORETTA
                         I got married before, you didn't 
                         sell.

               Loretta comes to the table. They sit down to breakfast.

                                     ROSE
                         Grandma was still alive. Chiro was 
                         still home going to school. Now he's 
                         married and gone to Florida. If you 
                         and Johnny moved in, had a baby...

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm thirty-seven years old.

                                     ROSE
                         What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro 
                         after I was thirty-seven. It ain't 
                         over till it's over.

                                     LORETTA
                         Johnny has a big apartment. We'll 
                         live there.

                                     ROSE
                         And we'll sell the house.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the 
                         house. But Pop don't like Johnny.

                                     ROSE
                         No. He don't.

               The WALL PHONE in the kitchen RINGS. Loretta goes and answers 
               it.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hello? Yea, this is Loretta Castorini - 
                         yeah. Is that you Johnny?

               INT. A DARKENED BEDROOM IN PALERMO - DAY

               Mr. Johnny is calling on an old European-style phone. In the 
               b.g. is the sickbed. In the sickbed lies VESTA, Mr. Johnny's 
               mother, her grey hair spread out on a golden pillow.

               By the bed are THREE MOURNERS, old crones dressed in black.

               One clutches a missal, the other two clutch rosaries. All 
               three are grieving in a steady low wordless whine. Mr. Johnny 
               speaks into the phone in a confidential manner. There is 
               some long-distance CRACKLE.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the 
                         deathbed of my mother.

               LORETTA ON THE PHONE

                                     LORETTA
                         How was your plane ride?

               MR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         The waitresses were very nice.
                              (glances over at his 
                              mother)
                         My mother is slipping away.

               LORETTA ON THE PHONE

                                     VESTA
                              (calling to the Heavens)
                         Quanto tempo devo aspettare?
                              (now she aims more at 
                              Johnny)
                         How long must I wait?!

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I can't talk long.

                                     LORETTA
                         Have you told her we're getting 
                         married?

               MR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment 
                         when she's peaceful.

               We HEAR Loretta's VOICE over his receiver.

                                     LORETTA'S VOICE
                         Just don't wait until she's dead.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Have you called my brother?

                                     LORETTA'S VOICE
                         Not yet.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Will you do it today? Call him, make 
                         him come to the wedding. Five years 
                         is too long for bad blood between 
                         brothers. Nothing can replace your 
                         family. I see that now.

               LORETTA ON THE PHONE

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright. I'll call him. Today. Listen, 
                         Johnny. Call me after you tell your 
                         mother. Alright? Alright. And don't 
                         stand directly under the sun. You've 
                         got your hat, use your hat. Alright. 
                         Bye-bye.

               Loretta hangs up the phone. She thinks. Rose speaks from the 
               table, where she's still sitting.

                                     ROSE
                         How's the mother?

                                     LORETTA
                         She's dying. But I could still hear 
                         her big mouth.

                                     ROSE
                         Did he tell her?

                                     LORETTA
                         Not yet. That old lady makes him 
                         sweat.
                              (to herself)
                         Where's that card?

               Rose gets up and takes the dishes to the sink, Loretta fishes 
               in her pocket and comes out with the business card Mr. Johnny 
               gave her. She dials the number.

                                     ROSE
                         Who Are you calling?

               INT. CAMMARERI PASTRY SHOP - DAY

               (INTERCUT W/LORETTA IN KITCHEN)

               CHRISSY, a woman with a Queens accent, answers.

                                     CHRISSY

                         Is Ronny there?

                                     CHRISSY
                         Hold on.
                              (yells into intercom)
                         Ronny, the phone!

               INT. CAMMARERI PASTRY SHOP - OVEN ROOM - DAY

               (INTERCUT W/LORETTA IN KITCHEN)

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah, this is Ronny.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm calling for your brother Johnny. 
                         He's getting married and he wants 
                         you to come.

               There's a long pause. Ronny's voice returns, hoarse with 
               emotion.

                                     RONNY
                         Why didn't he call himself?

                                     LORETTA
                         He's in Palermo.

                                     RONNY
                         What's wrong can never be made right.
                              (hangs up phone)

                                     LORETTA
                         Let me come and talk to you.

               Loretta hangs up the phone. She looks at the card again, 
               makes a decision and pockets the card.

               THE TOWNHOUSE/INT. THE BUICK - DAY

               As Cosmo drives away. He's in a very good mood. He's 
               WHISTLING. He laughs to himself.

               CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

               And the street in front of it. Loretta arrives. She's wearing 
               a long, navy-blue cloth coat and a knit hat. She looks up at 
               the sign and at the business card in her hand, and enters 
               the shop.

               INT. CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

               It's a nice Italian bake shop. Three Italian women, CHRISSY, 
               BARBARA, and MA wait on THREE WOMEN SHOPPERS at the counter.

               CHRISSY and BARBARA are in their late 20's or early 30's; MA 
               is old, old. Loretta comes in and speaks to CHRISSY.

                                     LORETTA
                         Is Ronny Cammareri here?

                                     CHRISSY
                         He down at the ovens. What do you 
                         want?

                                     LORETTA
                         I would like to speak to him.

               EXT. CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

               Chrissy comes out and Loretta follows. They walk around to 
               an outdoor staircase that descends into the sidewalk. Chrissy 
               shouts down.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Hey, RONNY.

               EXT. AN OLD DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE - DAY

               The door slides open, revealing ROCCO, a baker missing a few 
               teeth. He is surrounded by bread.

                                     ROCCO
                         What!

                                     CHRISSY'S VOICE
                         Somebody to see Ronny.

               Rocco slides back the door all the way. Chrissy and Loretta 
               make their way past him. He slides the door three quarters 
               shut behind them.

               INT. THE BASEMENT OVEN ROOM - DAY

               There are two coal-fired ovens, one at either end of the 
               room. There is a large wooden table roughly center. And 
               various pieces of baking equipment, dough-mixers, etc., 
               scattered willy-nilly. And everywhere there is bread.

               PIETRO, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long 
               wooden spatula. RONNY is working at the other oven.

               Actually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking 
               bread and burning coals. He's dressed in black jeans streaked 
               with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves, 
               and around his neck, a red handkerchief. He is black-haired, 
               handsome and intense.

                                     ROCCO
                         Ronny!

                                     RONNY
                         What!

                                     ROCCO
                         Somebody here to see you.

               Ronny turns and takes in Loretta.

                                     RONNY
                         Have you come from my brother?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yes.

                                     RONNY
                         Why?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm going to marry him.

                                     RONNY
                         You are going to marry my brother?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yes. Do you want...

                                     RONNY
                         I have no life.

                                     LORETTA
                         Excuse me.

                                     RONNY
                         I have no life. My brother Johnny 
                         took my life from me.

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't understand.

               Everything in the oven room has stopped and everyone is 
               watching.

                                     RONNY
                         And now he's getting married. He has 
                         his, he's getting his. And he wants 
                         me to come? What is life?

               He picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven.

                                     LORETTA
                         I didn't come here to upset you.

               Ronny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula, 
               turns them around, and slides them back in.

                                     RONNY
                         They say bread is life. So I bake 
                         bread, bread, bread.
                              (He's picking up loaves 
                              of bread from one of 
                              the boxes on the 
                              floor, and casually 
                              tossing them across 
                              the room.)
                         And the years go by! By! By! And I 
                         sweat and shovel this stinking dough 
                         in and outta this hot hole in the 
                         wall and I should be so happy, huh, 
                         sweetheart? You want me to come to 
                         the wedding of my brother Johnny?!! 
                         Where is my wedding? Chrissy! Over 
                         by the wall! Gimme the big knife!

                                     CHRISSY
                         No, Ronny!

               Barbara appears in the doorway and comes down the stairs 
               into the room.

                                     RONNY
                         Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut 
                         my throat!

                                     LORETTA
                         Maybe I should come back another 
                         time.

                                     RONNY
                         No, I want you to see this! I want 
                         you to watch me kill myself so you 
                         can tell my brother on his wedding 
                         day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!

                                     CHRISSY
                         I tell you I won't do it!

                                     RONNY
                              (to Loretta)
                         Do you know about me?

                                     BARBARA
                         Oh, Mr. Cammareri!

                                     RONNY
                         Nothing is anybody's fault, but things 
                         happen.
                              (holds up his left 
                              hand to Loretta)
                         Look.

               He pulls off the glove. The hand is made of wood.

                                     RONNY
                         It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago 
                         I was engaged to be married. Johnny 
                         came in here, he ordered bread from 
                         me. I put it in the slicer and I 
                         talked with him and my hand got caught 
                         cause I wasn't paying attention. The 
                         slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 
                         'cause - when my fiancé saw that I 
                         was maimed, she left me for another 
                         man.

                                     LORETTA
                         That's the bad blood between you and 
                         Johnny?

                                     RONNY
                         That's it.

                                     LORETTA
                         But that wasn't Johnny's fault.

                                     RONNY
                         I don't care! I ain't no freakin 
                         monument to justice! I lost my hand, 
                         I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, 
                         Johnny has his bride! You come in 
                         here and you want me to put away my 
                         heartbreak and forget?

               He goes to the big table, which is floured and covered with 
               bread. He sweeps everything off the tabletop during the next.

                                     RONNY
                         Is it just a matter of time till a 
                         man opens his eyes and gives up his 
                         one dream of happiness? Maybe. Maybe. 
                         All I have... Have you come here, 
                         Stranger, Bride of my Brother, to 
                         take these last few loaves from my 
                         table? Alright. Alright.

               The table is bare. He stares at it blankly. He wanders away, 
               to the back room where the flour sacks are kept. We hear a 
               single sob escape him from that room, and then silence.

               Everyone in the oven room looks after him. Then Chrissy 
               approaches Loretta. She holds the big knife at her side.

                                     CHRISSY
                         This is the most tormented man I 
                         have ever known. I am in love with 
                         this man. He doesn't know that. I 
                         never told him cause he can never 
                         love anybody since he lost his hand 
                         and his girl.

               She holds out the knife.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Here. Why don't you just kill him? 
                         It would be so much more kind than 
                         coming here and inviting him to a 
                         wedding like he'll never have.

               Loretta considers Chrissy, decides what she's going to do, 
               and goes to the flour room.

               INT. OF THE FLOUR ROOM - DAY

               Many 50 lb. bags of flour are stacked under a bare electric 
               bulb. A rough stone staircase opposite is lit by daylight 
               from above. Ronny, quietly distraught, stands leaning by his 
               forehead against a stack of flour. Loretta approaches him. 
               She feels for him.

                                     LORETTA
                         Where you live?

               He points to the stone staircase.

                                     RONNY
                         Upstairs.

               She touches his shoulder.

                                     LORETTA
                         Come on.

               He follows her up the stairs.

               EXT. THE STAIRCASE ENTRANCE ON THE STREET

               Loretta and Ronny emerge. He gestures. They enter the 
               apartment building behind the bakery.

               INT. THE PEACOCK CAFE  DAY

               It's a dark Italian coffee and dessert house. Reproductions 
               of Roman statuary adorn grottos and alcoves. In the back is 
               a glass case displaying various desserts, and behind the 
               case, a big burnished gold cappuccino machine. The place is 
               almost empty.

               MUSIC

               An album of "NEAPOLITAN FOLK SONGS" is PLAYING on the cafe's 
               SOUND SYSTEM.

               The CAMERA TRAVELS along the face of an exposed brick wall, 
               DISCOVERING busts of Romans occasionally, and then IT COMES 
               TO the figure of COSMO. He's sitting at a table which is 
               inset into a nook, so we cannot see who he's with.

               DARK NOOK IN THE CAFE

               At a little table away from prying eyes, Cosmo sits with 
               MONA, his girlfriend. Mona is a pretty but overripe Italian 
               woman in her late forties. She's all done up, and she looks 
               at Cosmo with adoration.

                                     COSMO
                         And then there is copper, which is 
                         the only pipe I use. It costs money. 
                         But it costs money because it saves 
                         money.

                                     MONA
                         And what did they say?

                                     COSMO
                         The man understood me. The woman 
                         wanted to be cheap, but the man saw 
                         that I was right.

                                     MONA
                         You have such a head for knowing. 
                         You know everything.

                                     COSMO
                         I brought you something.

               He takes out a small velvet box and hands it to her.

                                     COSMO
                         It's a present.

               She opens the box. It's a gold bracelet with a pattern of 
               stars and birds.

                                     MONA
                         Oh, Cosmo!

                                     COSMO
                         They are little stars and birds. 
                         Birds fly to the stars, I guess.

               EXT. RONNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               A three-story walk-up above Cammareri's Bakery.

               INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               It's a two-bedroom apartment. The decor reflects Ronny's 
               love of the opera. The furniture is overstuffed, fringed in 
               the colors of Italian passion. But it is all a bit faded, 
               the remains of an old flamboyance. The walls are decorated 
               with opera posters; and over the fireplace there is a painting 
               depicting a scene from "La Boheme": Mimi is standing in the 
               snow. Ronny stares at the picture of Mimi in the La Boheme 
               poster. Loretta comes in from the kitchen and sets down a 
               cup of coffee.

                                     LORETTA
                         You ready for the coffee?

               Loretta moves back into the kitchen. Ronny turns and watches 
               as she walks down the hall.

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta. What's that smell?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm making you a steak.

                                     RONNY
                         You don't have to help me.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know that. I do what I want.

                                     RONNY
                         I like it well done.

                                     LORETTA
                         You'll eat this bloody to feed your 
                         blood.

               INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT -DINING ROOM - DAY

               CU of Ronny's artificial hand, holding a fork stuck in a 
               steak. With his right he is cutting his steak. He switches 
               hands and eats hungrily. Loretta watches.

                                     RONNY
                         This is good. Uhh...

                                     LORETTA
                         Loretta.

                                     RONNY
                         Where'd Johnny find you?

                                     LORETTA
                         He knew my husband who died.

                                     RONNY
                         How'd he die?

                                     LORETTA
                         Bus hit him.

                                     RONNY
                         Fast.

                                     LORETTA
                         Instantaneous.

                                     RONNY
                         When you get engaged?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yesterday.

               Ronny drops his knife and fork and turns away. Loretta is 
               not surprised and does not move.

                                     RONNY
                         Why?

                                     LORETTA
                         Why what?

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know.

                                     LORETTA
                              (smiles)
                         So. Five years ago your hand got cut 
                         off and your woman left you for 
                         another man. No woman since then?

                                     RONNY
                         No.

                                     LORETTA
                         Stupid.

                                     RONNY
                         When your husband get hit by the 
                         bus?

                                     LORETTA
                         Seven years ago.

                                     RONNY
                         How many men since then?

                                     LORETTA
                         Just Johnny.

                                     RONNY
                         Stupid yourself.

                                     LORETTA
                         No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.

                                     RONNY
                         I don't care about Luck, you 
                         understand me? It ain't that.

                                     LORETTA
                         What? Do you think you're the only 
                         one ever shed a tear?

                                     RONNY
                         Why you talking to me?

                                     LORETTA
                         You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving 
                         me a glass of whiskey?

               EXT. STREET NEAR BAKERY - DAY

               SHOT OF COSMO & MONA IN THE BUICK

               The car has just come to a stop. We see Cosmo & Mona kiss.

               She exits car. Cosmo glances around with a slightly guilty 
               look and pulls away.

               LORETTA AND RONNY AT THE TABLE WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY

               Camera is close on Scotch being poured into two glasses.

               Loretta picks up her glass and swallows a healthy dose.

                                     RONNY
                         She was right to leave me.

                                     LORETTA
                         You think so?

                                     RONNY
                         Yes.

                                     LORETTA
                         You really are stupid, you know that.

               Loretta pours herself another shot.

                                     RONNY
                         You don't know nothing about it.

                                     LORETTA
                         I was raised that a girl gets married 
                         young. I didn't get married until I 
                         was twenty-eight. I met a man. I 
                         loved him. I married him. He wanted 
                         to have a baby right away. I said 
                         no. Then he got hit by a bus. No 
                         man. No baby. No nothing! I did not 
                         know that man was a gift I could not 
                         keep. I didn't know... You tell me a 
                         story and you think you know what it 
                         means, but I see what the true story 
                         is, and you can't.
                              (she pours them both 
                              another drink)
                         She didn't leave you! You can't see 
                         what you are. I can see everything. 
                         You are a wolf!

                                     RONNY
                         I'm a wolf?

                                     LORETTA
                         The big part of you has no words and 
                         it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap 
                         for you. She caught you and you could 
                         not get away.
                              (She grabs his wooden 
                              hand)
                         So you chewed off your foot! That 
                         was the price you had to pay to be 
                         free.
                              (throws his hand down)
                         Johnny had nothing to do with it. 
                         You did what you had to do, between 
                         you and you, and I know I'm right, I 
                         don't care what you say. And now 
                         you're afraid because you found out 
                         the big part of you is a wolf that 
                         has the courage to bite off its own 
                         hand to save itself from the trap of 
                         the wrong love. That's why there has 
                         been no woman since that wrong woman. 
                         You are scared to death what the 
                         wolf will do if you make that mistake 
                         again!

                                     RONNY
                         What are you doing!

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm telling you your life!

                                     RONNY
                         Stop it!

                                     LORETTA
                         No!

                                     RONNY
                         Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a 
                         fool!

                                     LORETTA
                         Because I have no Luck!

                                     RONNY
                              (pounding on the table)
                         He made me look the wrong way and I 
                         cut off my hand. He could make you 
                         look the wrong way and you could cut 
                         off your whole head!

                                     LORETTA
                         I am looking where I should to become 
                         a bride!

                                     RONNY
                         A bride without a head!

                                     LORETTA
                         A wolf without a foot!

               Ronny stiff-arms everything off the dining table and grabs 
               Loretta. They kiss passionately. He pulls her up on the table 
               and over the table to him. They are in each other's arms. 
               They are on fire. Loretta pushes him away, gasping for air.

                                     LORETTA
                         Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

               She changes her mind and lunges into another kiss. They stop 
               again after a long moment. They really haven't breathed.

               They both suck in air and look at each other in wonder and 
               fear and passion.

                                     RONNY
                         It's like I'm falling! It's like I'm 
                         in the ocean!

               They kiss again. When they pull apart again, Loretta is 
               crying.

                                     LORETTA
                         I have no Luck!

               He picks her up in his arms.

                                     RONNY
                         Son of a bitch!

                                     LORETTA
                         Where are you taking me?

                                     RONNY
                         To the bed.

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh. Oh God. I don't care about 
                         anything. I don't care about anything! 
                         Take me to the bed.

               He carries her away, into the bedroom.

               MUSIC: "O SOAVE FANCIULLA", from "La Boheme." The MUSIC 
               CONTINUES THROUGH THE NEXT SCENE.

               INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

               Ronny is laying her down in the bed. He is over her. They 
               look into each other's eyes.

                                     RONNY
                         I can't believe what is happening.

                                     LORETTA
                         Me neither.

                                     RONNY
                         I was dead.

                                     LORETTA
                         I was dead, too.

               They kiss. When they part there is a drop of blood on 
               Loretta's lips.

                                     RONNY
                         Your blood.

                                     LORETTA
                         All my life I have never reached a 
                         man. I knew that I would reach my 
                         husband, but I took my time and he 
                         was dead. Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         I want to cut you open and crawl 
                         inside of you. I want you to swallow 
                         me.

                                     RONNY
                         I've got you.

                                     LORETTA
                         Get all of me. Take everything.

                                     RONNY
                         What about Johnny?

                                     LORETTA
                         You're mad at him, take it out on 
                         me, take your revenge on me! Take 
                         everything, leave nothing for him to 
                         marry! Hollow me out so there's 
                         nothing left but the skin over my 
                         bones. Suck me dry!

                                     RONNY
                         Alright. Alright. There will be 
                         nothing left.

               Their eyes are boiling with fierce animal tears. They have 
               opened their souls to each other and they are coming together.

               The MUSIC SWELLS to a terrible triumph.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               Dog whines over exterior.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - AN UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

               With five beds for dogs. Four of the beds are empty and on 
               the fifth Judas is whining. He looks around at the other 
               beds. Where is everybody? He goes out the bedroom door.

               THE CASTORINI STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               Judas is running down the stairs and into the hall. We FOLLOW 
               HIM down the hall. The hall is only dimly lit. He finds the 
               four other dogs. They are crowded at a narrow doorway.

               From the doorway comes a golden light.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               THE PLEASED FACE OF COSMO THROUGH A VEIL OF STEAM

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK.

               We are in the Castorini dining room. Cosmo sits at the head 
               of the table, a napkin tucked into his shirt.

               Rose has just laid down a massive platter of steaming baked 
               fish. Already on the table is a platter of pasta, loaves of 
               bread, a big bowl of salad, two bottles of wine, and an 
               appetizer plate of salami and pimento. Seated at the table 
               is COSMO, the Old Man, and RAYMOND and RITA CAPPOMAGGI.

               Raymond is rotund, moon-faced, bald, somewhere in his fifties.

               He has a pencil-thin mustache over his small mouth. His wife, 
               Rita, looks very like him, except she has hair on her head 
               and none on her lip. Raymond is Rose's brother. There are 
               two empty places at table, for Rose and Loretta.

                                     COSMO
                         Where's Loretta? We're gonna start 
                         without her.

               ONE OF THE ENTRANCE WAYS TO THE DINING ROOM

               There is an accordion gate across it. Behind the gate, the 
               Five Dogs stare at the people having dinner.

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         She must be eating out.

                                     RAYMOND'S VOICE
                         She don't know what she's missing.

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         It's not like her not to call.

                                     RITA'S VOICE
                         Well, she's got a lot on her mind.

               THE DINING TABLE - RITA IS LOADING UP HER PLATE

                                     RITA
                         I mean, can we talk about it, Rose? 
                         Everybody's heard. She's getting 
                         married again.

                                     COSMO
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great 
                         and about time. What's she gonna do 
                         with the rest of her life she don't 
                         get married?

                                     COSMO
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

               The Old Man has piled his plate high with food. Now he stands 
               up, walks over to the Dogs, and puts the plate down in their 
               midst. The Dogs attack the food and each other. The Old Man 
               walks back to the table and sits down. He looks down at the 
               empty place in front of him, a little sad.

                                     COSMO
                         My father needs a plate.

               Rose gets another plate from a sideboard and puts it in front 
               of the Old Man. He immediately, methodically begins to fill 
               his new plate. Rose goes to her place and sits down.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Cosmo. Many years ago, when they 
                         told me you were marrying my sister, 
                         I was happy. When I told Rose I was 
                         marrying Rita, she was happy.

                                     RITA
                         Marriage is happy news.

               The Old Man laughs uproariously, subsides, goes back to 
               filling his plate.

                                     COSMO
                         Rose, pass the wine.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I never seen anybody so in love like 
                         Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside 
                         the house all day and look in the 
                         windows. I never told you this cause 
                         it's not really a story. But one 
                         time I woke up in the middle of the 
                         night cause this bright light was in 
                         my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't 
                         think a what it was. I looked out 
                         the window, and it was the moon! Big 
                         as a house! I never seen the moon so 
                         big before or since. I was almost 
                         scared, like it was gonna crush the 
                         house. And I looked down, and standing 
                         there in the street was Cosmo, looking 
                         up at the windows. This is the funny 
                         part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I 
                         thought you brought this big moon 
                         over to my house cause you were so 
                         in love and woke me up with it. I 
                         was half asleep I guess and didn't 
                         know no better.

                         You were altogether asleep. You were 
                         dreaming.

                                     RAYMOND
                         No. You were there.

               Raymond stares at Cosmo, nodding, remembering. There's a 
               lull at the table, the SOUND of SILVERWARE.

                                     COSMO
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

                              (suddenly angry)
                         Well, what do you wanna talk about!

                         Why you drinking so much?

               The Old Man gets up with his newly filled plate and heads 
               for the Dogs.

                                     ROSE
                         Old Man, if you give another piece 
                         of my food to those dogs, I'm gonna 
                         kick you till you're dead!

               The Old Man reverses direction and heads back to his chair.

               He sits down and starts to eat.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               Over the house is a great big full moon.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The lights in the bedroom are still on. Cosmo is in bed, in 
               his pajamas, asleep. Rose comes in her nightgown. She looks 
               at Cosmo. He's snoring lightly.

                                     ROSE
                         Cosmo?

               He doesn't stir. She goes to him and runs her hand through 
               his hair.

                                     ROSE
                         You drank too much and now you sleep 
                         too hard, and later you'll be up 
                         when you should be down.

               She kisses his cheek. Then she turns out the lights. When 
               the electric lights go out, moonlight floods the room. She 
               goes to the window and looks out through the curtains at the 
               moon. Rose puts her face in her hands and quietly cries.

               INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The bedroom is flooded by moonlight. Loretta wakes up, a 
               little alarmed.

                                     LORETTA
                         What's that?

               Ronny wakes up, a little alarmed.

                                     RONNY
                         What?

                                     LORETTA
                         That light.

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know. I think it's the moon.

               Loretta goes to the window wrapped in a white sheet from the 
               bed. The window is glowing with moonlight. The moonlight 
               strikes her, and she is caught in its spell.

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh.

               Ronny appears behind her, pulling on a robe. They speak in 
               low voices, as if they were in church.

                                     RONNY
                         It's so bright.

                                     LORETTA
                         I've never seen a moon like that.

                                     RONNY
                         It makes you look like an angel.

               She turns and looks at him. They kiss. They break apart.

               Ronny looks up at the moon.

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah. Looks like a big snowball.

               Shot of the house with the moon overhead.

               INT. RAYMOND AND RITA CAPPOMAGGI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               There is a big window right by the bed, and in the window is 
               the moon. Raymond and Rita are in their bed, asleep. Raymond 
               wakes up, and sees the moon in the window. He's stunned and 
               excited, but he too speaks in this low voice of respect.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Rita. Rita.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Look.

                                     RITA
                         Oh.

                                     RAYMOND
                         It's Cosmo's moon.

                                     RITA
                         What are you talking about, Raymond? 
                         Cosmo can't own the moon.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I mean it's that moon I was talking 
                         about at dinner.
                              (looks through the 
                              window, down into 
                              the street)
                         Is he down there? No.

                         Is who down there?

                         Cosmo.

                                     RITA
                         What would he be doing down there?

                                     RAYMOND
                         I don't know.

                                     RITA
                         You know, in this light, and with 
                         that expression on your face, you 
                         look about twenty-five years old.

               Raymond smiles at her meekly.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               Over the house is still the great big full moon. The front 
               door opens and out comes the Old Man with the five Dogs.

               The Old Man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat, and he's smoking 
               a cigar. He stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume 
               of cigar smoke. Then he starts off with the Dogs down the 
               street.

               EXT.. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

               The moon and nothing else. Then a cigar is thrown into it 
               and sends it shimmering. It was the moon reflected in water.

               Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK and WE SEE the Old Man and the 
               Five Dogs are standing on a ruined pier. The moon gleams up 
               from the Hudson River. The Old Man speaks to the Dogs.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Alright now. Howl. Howl.

               The Dogs do not howl. So the Old Man, by way of demonstration, 
               howls at the moon. He looks to the Dogs to follow suit. They 
               do nothing. He howls at the moon again.

               The Dogs do nothing. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until 
               WE CAN SEE the whole pier, with the Old Man and the Dogs on 
               it, and the moon above them. The Old Man, frustrated now, 
               cries out.

                                     OLD MAN
                         How long must I wait? Quanto tempo 
                         devo aspettare!

               The Dogs start to HOWL. The Old Man, pleased as the Mad Hatter 
               he is, laughs and laughs.

               INT. RONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

               Morning sun floods the room. Close on Loretta, she wakes up.

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh my God.

                         What?

               Loretta jumps from bed, grabs her clothes to cover herself, 
               and backs into closet.

                                     LORETTA
                         What? What have we done?

                              (perturbed)
                         Take it easy.

                              (from closet as she 
                              hurriedly gets dressed)
                         This time I was trying to do 
                         everything right.

                                     RONNY

                              pulls it on, puts it 
                              on and moves towards 
                              the closet.)
                         Don't just become excited.

                                     LORETTA
                         I thought if I stayed away from the 
                         City Hall, I won't have that Bad 
                         Luck I had again.

                                     RONNY
                         You're trying to make me feel guilty.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm marrying your brother!

                                     RONNY
                         All right, I'm guilty. I confess!

                         You're invited to the wedding! It's 
                         in a few weeks. Why didn't you do 
                         like him and be with your dying mother 
                         in Palermo?

                                     RONNY
                         She didn't like me.

                                     LORETTA
                         You don't get along with anybody!

                                     RONNY
                         What did you do?

                                     LORETTA
                         What did I do?

                                     RONNY
                         You ruined my life.

                                     LORETTA
                         That's impossible! It was ruint when 
                         I got here! You ruint my life!

                                     RONNY
                         Oh no I didn't!

               Loretta emerges from the closet, tucking in her blouse.

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got 
                         those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why 
                         didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! 
                         Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why 
                         didn't I just pick up a stone and 
                         kill myself years and years ago? I'm 
                         gonna marry him!

                                     RONNY
                         What?

                                     LORETTA
                         Last night never happened, you hear 
                         me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and 
                         last night never happened, and you 
                         and I are gonna take this to our 
                         coffins!

                                     RONNY
                         I can't do that!

                                     LORETTA
                         Why not?

                                     RONNY
                         I'm in love with you!

               Loretta stares at him in alarm, slaps his face, then studies 
               his face to see the effect of the slap. She is dissatisfied 
               and slaps him again.

                                     LORETTA
                         Snap out of it!

                                     RONNY
                         I can't!

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright. Then I must never see you 
                         again. The bad blood will have to 
                         stay there between you and Johnny 
                         for all time. You won't come to the 
                         wedding.

                                     RONNY
                         I'll come to the wedding.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm telling you you can't.

                                     RONNY
                         But he wants me to come!

                                     LORETTA
                         But that's cause he don't know!

                                     RONNY
                         Alright. I will not come. Provided 
                         one thing.

                                     LORETTA
                         What?

                                     RONNY
                         That you come with me tonight. Once. 
                         To the Opera.

                                     LORETTA
                         What are you talking about?

                                     RONNY
                         I love two things. I love you, and I 
                         love the Opera. If I can have the 
                         two things that I love together for 
                         one night, I will be satisfied to 
                         give up the rest of my life.

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright.

                                     RONNY
                         Alright. Meet me at the Met.

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright. Where's the Met?

               CATHOLIC CHURCH IN LITTLE ITALY - DAY

               Camera moves from stained glass windows to confessional.

               Loretta is next in line of THREE SINNERS waiting to go into 
               the confessional. A FORGIVEN WOMAN emerges from the curtained 
               booth and walks off to pay her penance. Loretta goes into 
               the booth.

               INT. CHURCH - CONFESSIONAL - DAY

               Loretta kneels. The slide opens and an OLD PRIEST'S FACE can 
               be seen in outline through the screen.

                                     LORETTA
                         Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. 
                         It's been two months since my last 
                         confession.

                                     PRIEST
                         What sins have you to confess?

                                     LORETTA
                         Twice I took the name of God in vain, 
                         once I slept with the brother of my 
                         fiancé, and once I bounced a check 
                         at the liquor store -- but that was 
                         really an accident.

                                     PRIEST
                         Then it was not a sin. But what was 
                         that second thing you said, Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         I... a... slept with my fiancé's 
                         brother.

                                     PRIEST
                         That's a pretty big sin.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know.

                                     PRIEST
                         You should think about this.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know.

                                     PRIEST
                         Alright. This is your penance. Say 
                         two rosaries and... be careful, 
                         Loretta. Reflect on your life.

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright.

                                     PRIEST
                         I absolve you in the name of the 
                         Father, and of the Son, and of the 
                         Holy Spirit, Amen.

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               Loretta comes out of the confessional and enters a pew. She 
               crosses herself. Then she recognizes the back of a woman's 
               head a few pews down. She gets up, walks down the aisle, and 
               kneels down next to her mother, Rose.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi.

                                     ROSE
                              (looking up from her 
                              prayers)
                         Where you been?

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

                                     ROSE
                         Just like your father. I lied to 
                         him. He thinks you came home last 
                         night.

                                     LORETTA
                         Thanks. What's the matter with you?

                                     ROSE
                         Cosmo's cheating on me.

                                     LORETTA
                         What! How do you know?

                                     ROSE
                         A wife knows.

                                     LORETTA
                         Then you don't know. You're just 
                         imagining it. He's too old.

               Rose starts to reply, but then decides it's not worth the 
               argument.

                                     LORETTA
                         I won't be home for dinner.

               Loretta crosses herself quickly, gets up, and leaves. Rose 
               looks after, and then goes back to her prayer.

               INT. CAMMARERI'S BAKERY - DAY

               Feminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue 
               icing to a wedding cake. Then the hands set the plastic bride 
               and groom on the pinnacle. The CAMERA PULLS BACK.

               Barbara is viewing her handiwork, a wedding cake on a 
               stainless steel wheeled cart. She's in the back part of the 
               bakery. Barbara is pleased with her creation. We TRAVEL WITH 
               HER as she rolls the cart out to the front of the store where 
               Chrissy is waiting on a huge man named HARVEY. She hands him 
               a tiny box, which he takes meekly.

                                     HARVEY
                         See you tomorrow, Chrissy.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Okay, Harvey.

               Harvey lumbers off as Barbara enters the front of the store 
               with the cake on its cart. Barbara calls Chrissy's attention 
               to the cake.

                                     BARBARA
                         So what do you think?

                                     CHRISSY
                         About what?

                                     BARBARA
                         The cake!

                                     CHRISSY
                              (without enthusiasm)
                         Where's Ronny? How come he ain't 
                         come down?

                                     BARBARA
                         How should I know?

               The PHONE RINGS. Chrissy answers it.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Hello, Cammareri's? Hi. Uh-huh. Okay.

               She hangs up.

                                     CHRISSY
                         That was Ronny. He don't feel good. 
                         He ain't gonna be down today.

               Chrissy comes out from behind the counter. She's staring at 
               the cake.

                                     BARBARA
                         What, is he still upset?

               Without warning, Chrissy whacks the little bride and groom 
               off the cake and on to the floor.

                                     CHRISSY
                         It's that bitch!

               Barbara looks at her, shocked.

               EXT. CAPPOMAGGI'S ITALIAN PROVISIONS - DAY

               An Italian specialty store in Little Italy.

               INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY

               Provolones and salamis hang from above. To the one side is a 
               deli counter, to the other a series of tables displaying 
               cheeses by the pound, packaged cakes, etc. In the back are a 
               few tables and a kitchen with counter. Up front, behind the 
               deli counter, stands Rita Cappomaggi in a blue apron.

               Out by the tables, Raymond unpacks some jars of olives. In 
               the back, a TRUCK DRIVER can dimly be seen eating his lunch.

                                     RAYMOND
                              (to Rita)
                         I feel great I got no sleep but I 
                         feel like Orlando Furioso!

                                     RITA
                              (looks around 
                              cautiously, then 
                              speaks)
                         You were a tiger last night.

                                     RAYMOND
                         And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.

                                     RITA
                         Shut up. They'll hear you in the 
                         back.

                                     RAYMOND
                         So what? The pleasure of marriage is 
                         you sleep with the woman and then 
                         you don't worry about nothing. Hey, 
                         how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's 
                         eat pasta and roll around.

                                     RITA
                              (scandalized)
                         Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! 
                         What's got into you?

                                     RAYMOND
                         I don't know! That moon! That crazy 
                         moon Cosmo sent over!

               Loretta walks in.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Hey there
                              (sings)
                         ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...

                                     LORETTA
                              (to Rita)
                         What's the matter with him?

                                     RITA
                         You got me.

                                     RAYMOND
                         You see that moon last night?

                                     LORETTA
                              (suspicious and guilty)
                         What about the moon?

                                     RAYMOND
                         Did you see it?

                                     LORETTA
                              (she lies, nervous)
                         No.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Oh.

                                     LORETTA
                         Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the 
                         deposit to the bank but I'll do the 
                         books tomorrow. I gotta go.

                                     RAYMOND
                         You gotta date?

                                     RITA
                         What are you talking about, you fool? 
                         Her fiancé's in Palermo.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Oh. Right.

                                     LORETTA
                         I got things to do.

                                     RITA
                         Sure you do. You got all that wedding 
                         stuff.

                                     LORETTA
                         Right.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Well, that's romantic, too.
                              (SINGS)
                         ...ISN'T IT ROMANTIC...

               He is walking towards the back now. He shouts to somebody in 
               the kitchen.

                                     RAYMOND
                         HEY. Make me a bowl of minestrone.

               The women are left alone.

                                     RITA
                         What's the matter? You look crazy.

                                     LORETTA
                         I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.

               INT. A CHURCH BASEMENT

               It's been set up for a church bazaar. There are several wheels 
               of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game 
               of ring toss, etc. AS THE CAMERA inventories the contents of 
               the various stands -- a LITTLE NUN sleeps in one of them -- 
               we HEAR the Old Man's VOICE.

                                     OLD MAN'S VOICE
                         I've got a lot on my mind. Things 
                         are getting bad in my house. My 
                         daughter-in-law is mad at my son 
                         because he will not pay for the 
                         wedding.

               A TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER

               An old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it 
               with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand 
               belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old 
               Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives 
               a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer.

               Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips 
               it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy 
               goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray 
               where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the 
               Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever 
               to drive the stake into the apple. This frustrates Felix.

                                     OLD MAN
                         At dinner, my daughter-in-law 
                         threatened to kill me. Things are 
                         very bad in my house.

                                     FELIX
                         Hurry up.

                                     LUCY
                         Don't fight.

                                     OLD MAN
                         If I hit the stick too hard, the 
                         apple will split. If I am too timid, 
                         the apple will fall off the stick.

                                     FELIX
                         We're supposed to do fifty apples. 
                         We only got twelve done.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I don't know what to advise my son. 
                         I think he should pay for the wedding, 
                         but it is important that he don't 
                         look ridiculous.

                                     LUCY
                         Don't make yourself sick.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at 
                         dinner.

                                     LUCY
                         Talk to him.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I will. But I must find the right 
                         moment.

                                     LUCY
                         Did you see the moon last night?

               The Old Man's eyes light up. He looks at Lucy.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Yes!

                                     FELIX
                              (in despair)
                         Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five 
                         minutes.

               INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY

               EIGHT NEAT STACKS OF MONEY BEING RUBBERBANDED

               By a woman's hands. The last stack is topped with a filled 
               out deposit slip. The banded stacks are then stuffed into a 
               night-deposit bag. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a bit to INCLUDE a 
               ledger. A last entry is made, and the ledger is shut. The 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK more, and now WE SEE Loretta reaching for 
               her coat. She puts it on, picks up the deposit bag, and sees 
               Rita.

                                     LORETTA
                         Bye, Aunt Rita.

                                     RITA
                         Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yeah, I'll be in.

               Loretta goes out the door, with Rita looking after, 
               thoughtful.

               EXT. THE CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY

               Loretta walks-down the street and comes to the CINDERELLA 
               BEAUTY SHOP, fidgets a moment, looks around to see if 
               anybody's looking, and goes in.

               WE SEE her through the window talking to MILDRED, who handles 
               appointments. Mildred nods, points, and Loretta goes back 
               into the store.

               INT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY

               WE DISCOVER an uneasy Loretta sitting in a beauty chair with 
               BONNIE, her hairdresser about to start. Bonnie is a little 
               bored.

                                     BONNIE
                         So? You want the usual?

                                     LORETTA
                         I want you to get rid of the grey.

               TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC STARTS HERE AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE 
               FOLLOWING SCENES. This music should convey that Loretta is 
               turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful 
               coach. Bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and 
               gets very excited.

                                     BONNIE
                         I've been wanting to do this for 
                         three years! Let me show you some 
                         magazines! You've got to get a 
                         manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila! 
                         I'm gonna need help!

               SHEILA, another beautician, joins Bonnie, and they both get 
               very excited and start showing Loretta and each other 
               magazines. They argue merrily about what they should do, 
               leaving Loretta far behind. A MANICURIST joins them, with 
               her stuff and starts soaking Loretta's nails.

               A MONTAGE FOLLOWS

               They're plucking her eyebrows.

               They're cutting and dying her hair.

               They're painting her nails.

               EXT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP-DAY

               Loretta comes out. Her hair is jet black and done in a much 
               more stylish way. She looks great. She looks around as if 
               she has committed a crime, and walks off quickly

               EXT. A DOWDY DRESS SHOP - DAY

               Loretta looks in the windows, is dissatisfied, and walks on.

               EXT. A BOLD DRESS SHOP - DAY

               A stylish dress shop called INSINUATION. Loretta looks in 
               the window, is intimidated, and walks on. A moment passes.

               She reappears. Tentatively, she enters.

               INT. INSINUATION - DAY

               Loretta approaches a young woman, MER, who works there. Mer 
               is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta 
               greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey 
               what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she 
               wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.

               There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various 
               dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some 
               incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in 
               a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her 
               because they're so sexy, one bores her. We don't see the 
               dress that she ultimately does buy.

               EXT. INSINUATION - DUSK

               Loretta walks out with a big shopping bag. She walks away 
               down the street.

               WE FOLLOW Loretta away down the street. She comes to a BRIDAL 
               SHOP with a big bride dummy shown off in the window She stops 
               and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and 
               stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.

               Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy, 
               bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology, 
               and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop 
               window.

               END OF MUSIC

               THE TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC COMES TO A CLOSE.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DUSK

               Night is falling. Loretta appears and enters the house.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

               As Loretta enters she drops her bag and, as she takes off 
               her coat, calls.

                                     LORETTA
                         Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay.

               A SINGLE BARK is HEARD from the top of the stairs. She looks 
               up.

               A WOODEN ACCORDION GATE SEALS OFF THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

               Visible behind the gate are a couple of dogs.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Loretta goes through a door and into the kitchen. She opens 
               the refrigerator and a cabinet, and makes herself a scotch 
               on the rocks. She sips it and starts to HUM in an understated 
               way. She takes her drink and wanders out of the kitchen.

               LORETTA WALKS INTO THE LIVING ROOM

               She walks to each lamp in the room and turns it on. There 
               are many table and standing lamps throughout the room.

               LORETTA IS LIGHTING THE FIRE

               Which was already built in the fireplace. It catches on 
               nicely. She puts her drink down and gets a big standing 
               antique mirror on rollers from its place against the wall.

               She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she 
               picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and 
               then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair. 
               Then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums. 
               She selects one and puts it on.

               MUSIC

               Loretta waltzes around in front of the mirror, flirting with 
               herself in a very serious way. She starts to unbutton her 
               blouse.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               The moon is overhead as music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA 
               SOARS UP CLOSE to the moon, until it completely FILLS THE 
               FRAME with its magic. The moon dissolves into:

               INT. THE CASTORINI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE-UP of LORETTA'S FACE as she puts the final touches on 
               her make-up. Music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA PULLS BACK. 
               WE SEE her full figure. She has changed into her evening 
               dress and put on her heels. She's swaying to the music. The 
               evening dress is sensational. She leans forward and kisses 
               the mirror.

               WE SEE THE LIPSTICK KISS ON THE MIRROR

               In the mirror, all around the kiss, is reflected the fire.

               EXT. EAST RIVER NIGHT

               The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the 
               night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river.

               But then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge 
               white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights 
               burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along 
               the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the

               END OF MUSIC

               EXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT

               LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created 
               by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled 
               with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand 
               and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. 
               Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, 
               inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous 
               color.

               LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN

               The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.

               She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights 
               up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger 
               jets.

               Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher 
               into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her 
               eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, 
               like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.

               FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER

               Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for 
               its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing 
               quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite 
               side of the fountain, is Ronny.

               He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and 
               topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises 
               a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles 
               brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and 
               starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the 
               fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her 
               attempt at composure from, Ronny.

               Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around 
               the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her.

                                     RONNY
                         Hi.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi.

                                     RONNY
                         You look beautiful. Your hair...

                                     LORETTA
                         I thought I'd try it.
                              (qrudgingly)
                         You look good.

                                     RONNY
                         Thank you.

               He goes to kiss her. She takes a step back.

                                     LORETTA
                         I said I'd go to the opera with you. 
                         Nothing else.

               Ronny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they 
               walk off in the direction of the opera house.

               Ronny and Loretta looking up at it.

                         Who painted that?

                                     RONNY
                         Marc Chagall. A Russian.

                                     LORETTA
                         Kinda gaudy.

                                     RONNY
                         He was having some fun. Yeah, well 
                         he's dead.
                              (he smiles)
                         Come on, let's go in.

               Ronny and Loretta join the crowd streaming into the building.

               INT. THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta enter, giving tickets to usher.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta checking their coats. Ronny's coat is 
               already off, and he's helping Loretta off with hers. He hands 
               her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns 
               and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time.

               He's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles.

                                     RONNY
                         Thank you!

                                     LORETTA
                         For what?

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know. For your hair. For 
                         your beautiful dress. For... you 
                         know, I feel like a man again. You 
                         know I love the Opera. You know it's 
                         been a long time since I've been to 
                         the Opera.

               His eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts 
               to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself.

                                     LORETTA
                         So. Where are we sitting?

                                     RONNY
                         Come on.

               He takes her arm. They pass under the great chandelier and 
               go into the house.

               THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

               THE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES

               The first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished 
               pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are 
               in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands.

               Next is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son, 
               John. They are seated and people are looking at them.

               Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down, 
               something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing 
               good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes 
               her look like a big piece of hard candy.

               Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row 
               of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.

               They are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program.

               THE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA'S POV

               The opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into 
               the dark as the house lights go down.

               WE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND

               Ronny leans his head toward her and whispers.

                                     RONNY
                         Here we go.

               As the lights come up in the orchestra pit. The CONDUCTOR 
               takes his place. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. He bows and turns to 
               the orchestra. The OVERTURE begins and PLAYS UNDER NEXT.

               EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

               The OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then 
               FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter 
               the restaurant.

               INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

               The dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied.

               The entranceway door opens and Rose enters.

               She's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly 
               approaches her. She's very dignified.

                                     JIMMY
                         Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming?

                                     ROSE
                         It's just me. I want to eat.

                                     JIMMY
                         Okay.

                                     JIMMY
                         I got a table for you right now.

               Jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall.

                                     JIMMY
                         This alright?

                                     ROSE
                         Fine.

               He seats her.

                                     JIMMY
                         Enjoy your meal.

               Jimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the 
               wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV, 
               and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, 
               is having an argument with the man across from her.

               But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and 
               the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's 
               table.

                                     BOBO
                         Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You 
                         eating alone tonight?

                                     ROSE
                         Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a 
                         martini, no ice and two olives.

                                     BOBO
                         Very good.

               Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table 
               catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a 
               little louder.

                                     SHEILA'S VOICE
                         I'm trying to explain to you how I 
                         feel. Every time I try to explain 
                         how I feel, you explain how you feel. 
                         I don't think that's really much of 
                         a response.

                                     UNSEEN MAN'S VOICE
                         Well, its the only response I've 
                         got.

               Bobo reappears with the martini and serves it.

                                     BOBO
                         You wanna see a menu?

                                     ROSE
                         Not yet. I'll wave.

               Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at 
               the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the 
               man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument 
               goes on.

                                     SHEILA'S VOICE
                         I really do hate it though, when you 
                         take that tone with me. Like you're 
                         above it all and isn't it amusing.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         But it is, isn't it?

                                     SHEILA'S VOICE
                         Not to me! This is my life, no matter 
                         how damned comical it may seem to 
                         you. I don't need some man standing 
                         above the struggle while I roll around 
                         in the mud!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         I think you like the mud and I don't. 
                         That's fair, isn't it? If I don't 
                         care to...

               Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the 
               man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and 
               stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.

               When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to 
               Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his 
               50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the 
               earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with 
               beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and 
               apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.

                                     PERRY
                         Sorry about that, folks. She's a 
                         very pretty mental patient.

               The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself.

                                     PERRY
                         Don't mind about me. But could you 
                         do me a favor and clear her place 
                         and take away all evidence of her, 
                         and bring me a big glass of vodka?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         Absolutely!

               The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry 
               notices Rose.

               They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now.

                                     PERRY
                         I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm not disturbed. By you.

                                     PERRY
                         My lady friend has a personality 
                         disorder.

                                     ROSE
                         She was just too young for you.

               The Shy Waiter serves Perry his drink.

                                     PERRY
                              (to the Waiter)
                         Thanks, comrade.

                                     SHY WAITER
                         It's nothing!

               The Shy Waiter goes.

                                     PERRY
                              (Rose's comment strikes 
                              home)
                         Ouch. Too young! I just got that. 
                         You know how to hurt guy. How old 
                         are you?

                                     ROSE
                         None of your business.

               He drops his posturing.

                                     PERRY
                         Sorry. That was rude.

                                     ROSE
                         Will you join me for dinner?

                                     PERRY
                         Are you sure?

               She nods.

                                     PERRY
                         Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating 
                         alone, and it's amazing how often I 
                         end up doing just that.

               ROSE AND PERRY ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR DINNER

                                     ROSE
                         What do you do?

                                     PERRY
                         I'm a professor. I teach 
                         communications at N.Y.U.

                                     ROSE
                         That woman was a student of yours?

                                     PERRY
                         Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.

                                     ROSE
                         There's old saying my mother told 
                         me. Would you like to hear it?

                                     PERRY
                         Yes.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't shit where you eat.

                                     PERRY
                              (taken aback, then 
                              recovering)
                         I'll remember that. What do you do?

                                     ROSE
                         I'm a housewife.

                                     PERRY
                         Then why are you eating alone?

                                     ROSE
                         I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you 
                         a question?

                                     PERRY
                         Go ahead.

                                     ROSE
                         Why do men chase women?

                                     PERRY
                              (considers)
                         Nerves.

                                     ROSE
                         I think it's because they fear death.

                                     PERRY
                         Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I 
                         chase women? I find women charming.

                                     PERRY
                         I teach these classes I've taught 
                         for a million years. The spontaneity 
                         went out of it for me a long time 
                         ago. I started off, I was excited 
                         about something and I wanted to share 
                         it. Now it's rote, it's the 
                         multiplication table. Except 
                         sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning 
                         along and I look up, and there's 
                         this fresh young beautiful face, and 
                         it's all new to her and I'm this 
                         great guy who's just brilliant and 
                         thinks out loud. And when that 
                         happens, when I look out among those 
                         chairs and look at a young woman's 
                         face, and see me there in her eyes, 
                         me the way I always wanted to be and 
                         maybe once was, then I ask her out 
                         on a date. It doesn't last. It can 
                         go for a few weeks or a couple of 
                         precious months, but then she catches 
                         on that I'm just a burnt out old 
                         gasbag and that she's as fresh and 
                         bright and full of promise as 
                         moonlight in a martini. And at that 
                         moment, she stands up and throws a 
                         glass of water in my face, or some 
                         action to that effect.

                         What you don't know about women is a 
                         lot.

               INT. THE OPERA HOUSE-LOBBY-NIGHT

               INTERMISSION. THRONGS OF PEOPLE talking, talking, talking.

               Piled up at the bars to get drinks.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - LOBBY/WOMEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Outside the women's bathroom, with its huge line waiting to 
               get in.

               INT. OF THE WOMAN'S BATHROOM

               Loretta and THREE OTHER WOMEN freshen their makeup before a 
               mirror. The woman next to Loretta leaves and is replaced by 
               Mona. Mona and Loretta stand side by side freshening their 
               makeup.

               INT. OF THE OPERA HOUSE - LOBBY - NIGHT

               MANY PEOPLE pressing to the bar to buy drinks. Cosmo and 
               Ronny achieve the bar's perimeter at the same moment, and 
               start to order.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - LOBBY - NIGHT

               A CONCESSIONAIRE selling special glossy LA BOHEME programs.

               ELSEWHERE IN THE LOBBY DURING INTERMISSION

               Ronny and Loretta are standing by a column holding drinks.

               Loretta is looking around.

                                     LORETTA
                         They get some turnout for this stuff.

                                     RONNY
                         It's the best thing there is.

                                     LORETTA
                         I like parts of it, but I don't really 
                         get it.

               IN ANOTHER PART OF THE LOBBY DURING INTERMISSION Cosmo and 
               Mona are sitting on a bench.

                                     MONA
                         You haven't once said you like my 
                         dress.

                                     COSMO
                         I like your dress.
                              (he thinks)
                         It's very bright.

               He looks around.

                                     MONA
                         Why you looking around so much?

                                     COSMO
                         I don't know. I got a feeling.

                                     MONA
                         I'm wearing your bracelet.

               He nods, still looking around.

               CHIMES SOUND THROUGHOUT LOBBY

               Indicating the end of intermission. The Audience starts to 
               file back into the theatre.

               EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

               Rose and Perry emerge from the restaurant.

                                     PERRY
                         May I walk with you a ways?

                                     ROSE
                         Sure.

               They set off to the left.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               The door opens, and the Old Man comes out, in his great coat 
               and hat, with the Five dogs. He strikes off to the right.

               EXT. STREET I - NIGHT

               Rose and Perry come around a corner and pass a store. They 
               pause and look at the Christmas decorations in the window.

               They continue walking.

               EXT. STREET II - NIGHT

               The Old Man and the Dogs have stopped by a big tree. Which 
               the dogs adore.

               EXT. STREET I - NIGHT

               Rose and Perry walking. They exit camera left.

               EXT. STREET II - NIGHT

               The Old Man drags the Dogs away from the tree and sets off 
               camera right.

               EXT. STREET I - NIGHT

               Rose and Perry walking to the left.

               EXT . STREET II - NIGHT

               The Old Man and the Dogs walking to the right.

               EXT. STREET I - INTERSECTION

               OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT

               Rose and Perry are walking towards camera. Rose stops short, 
               stunned and alarmed by what she sees before them.

               EXT. STREET II - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE OF LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT

               The Old Man pulls up the Dogs. Aghast by what he sees before 
               him.

               EXT. STREET III - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT

               Perry and Rose face the Old Man and the dogs.

               In a silent standoff. Perry is puzzled, but has the sense to 
               say nothing. After a long moment, the Old Man silently steers 
               his dogs past them. He walks away down the dark street, 
               silently disappearing into the gloom. Perry and Rose never 
               move, but follow his slow progress until he disappears.

                                     PERRY
                         You knew that man?

                                     ROSE
                         Yes.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

               THE STAGE - THE OPERA IS IN PROGRESS

               It's the SCENE in which MIMI is standing in the falling snow.

               She SINGS to RUDOLPH. It is a beautiful, poignant moment.

               The snow is falling, falling. Mimi is SINGING her 
               heartbreaking aria of farewell. The lighted tavern window is 
               behind them, glowing with a golden light.

               WE SEE RONNY'S FACE

               He's staring intently at the stage with shining eyes. He 
               wants to share this moment with Loretta, but he is timid she 
               will not feel as he does.

               WE SEE LORETTA'S FACE

               A single tear trails down her cheek. Otherwise, she is almost 
               succeeding in hiding that the opera is moving her. She notices 
               Ronny's hand creeping towards hers, but makes no move towards 
               it.

               THE STAGE - MIMI STILL SINGING SADLY IN THE SNOWFALL

               She and Rudolph join hands.

               RONNY AND LORETTA

               grab each other's hand fiercely.

               At last, they look at each other. She is admitting that she 
               is affected by the opera. He is grateful that she admits it.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - AUDIENCE  NIGHT

               Audience exits.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE-LOBBY - NIGHT

               The lobby overflowing with the AUDIENCE coming out.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta at the coatcheck. Loretta dabs her eyes 
               and blows her nose.

                                     LORETTA
                         That was just so... awful!

                                     RONNY
                         Awful?

                                     LORETTA
                         Beautiful. Sad. She died!

                                     RONNY
                              (giving the check to 
                              the checker)
                         Yeah.

                                     LORETTA
                         I couldn't believe it! I didn't think 
                         she was going to die. I knew she was 
                         sick...

               Ronny gets the coats and helps her on with hers.

                                     RONNY
                         She had TB.

               Ronny is putting on his coat.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know. She was coughing her brains 
                         out. And still, she had to sing all 
                         the time...

               Loretta has stopped suddenly, transfixed by the sight before 
               her.

               Loretta and Ronny are standing face-to-face with Cosmo and 
               Mona. Mona's wearing a coat like a wrapper for hard candy.

               Cosmo is wearing his coat and has his hat in his hand.

               Stunned at seeing Loretta, he unconsciously puts his hat on.

               Then he thinks about it and takes it off again. He looks at 
               Ronny. Then he looks at Mona.

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop?

               Ronny looks at Loretta. He waits to follow her lead.

                                     COSMO
                         Wait for me by the doors, Mona.

               Mona obeys after looking curiously at Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop? What are you doing here?

               Cosmo approaches Ronny.

                                     COSMO
                         Excuse me.

               He takes Loretta's arm and steers her a distance away for a 
               confidential exchange.

                                     LORETTA
                         Mona?

                                     COSMO
                         What'd you do to your hair?

                                     LORETTA
                         I got it done.

                                     COSMO
                         What are you doing here?

                                     LORETTA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     COSMO
                         Who is this man? You're engaged!

                                     LORETTA
                         You're married.

                                     COSMO
                         You're my daughter. I won't have you 
                         acting like a tramp!

                                     LORETTA
                         You're my father.

                                     COSMO
                         Alright. I didn't see you here.

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't know whether I saw you or 
                         not.

               Cosmo puts on his hat again. He glares at Ronny. He looks at 
               Loretta, but he's at a total loss. At last, he stalks off. 
               Loretta looks after him, angry and disturbed.

               COSMO AND MONA GOING OUT THE DOORS FROM LORETTA'S POV

               LORETTA LOOKING AFTER THEM, STRICKEN

               Ronny appears at her side, solicitous.

                                     RONNY
                         Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a 
                         drink.

               Loretta, still looking after, slowly shakes her head.

                                     LORETTA
                         That wasn't my mother.

               EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               Rose and Perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly 
               shining. About half a block away stands the Castorini house.

               They regard it. Over the house hangs the moon, cut through 
               now with a sharp grey cloud. Rose and Perry's VOICES can be 
               heard.

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         That's my house.

                                     PERRY'S VOICE
                         You mean the whole house?

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         Yes.

                                     PERRY'S VOICE
                         My God, it's a mansion!

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         It's a house.

                                     PERRY'S VOICE
                         I live in a one-bedroom apartment. 
                         What exactly does your husband do?

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         He's a plumber.

                                     PERRY'S VOICE
                         Well. That explains it.

               The SOUND of the WIND can be heard rising up.

               NOW WE SEE ROSE AND PERRY CLOSE UP

               The rising cold wind stirs their hair. They both shiver 
               slightly.

                                     PERRY
                         Temperature's dropping.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes.

                                     PERRY
                         I guess you can't invite me in?

                                     ROSE
                         No.

                                     PERRY
                         People home.

                                     ROSE
                         No. I think the house is empty. I 
                         can't invite you in because I'm 
                         married and because I know who I am.
                         You're shaking.

                                     PERRY
                         I'm a little cold.

                                     ROSE
                         You're a little boy and you like to 
                         be bad.

                                     PERRY
                         We could go to my apartment. You 
                         could see how the other half lives.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm too old for you.

                                     PERRY
                         I'm too old for me. That's my 
                         predicament.

                                     ROSE
                         Good night.

               She kisses him on the cheek.

                                     PERRY
                         Good night. Can I kiss you on the 
                         cheek, too?

                                     ROSE
                         Sure.

               He kisses her on the cheek.

                                     PERRY
                         I'm freezing

                                     ROSE
                         Good night.

               She walks away, towards the house. Perry, shivering, looks 
               after.

               INT. THE BOERUM CAFE - A BROOKLYN BAR - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta sit at the bar. They are just finishing a 
               couple of Old-Fashions. The barman, AL, inspects their drinks.

                                     AL
                         Another Old-Fashion?

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         No thanks.

                                     RONNY
                              (to Al)
                         I think that's it.

               Al nods and walks off. Ronny leans forward to Loretta.

                                     RONNY
                         What do you want to do now?

                                     LORETTA
                         I wanna go home.

               EXT. A COLD AND EMPTY MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta are walking. Their breath is coming out in 
               long plumes.

                                     LORETTA
                         It's really cold.

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah. It smells like snow.

               They walk in silence for a moment, then Loretta speaks.

                                     LORETTA
                         My mother guessed that my father was 
                         seeing somebody and I told her she 
                         was crazy. She looked like a real 
                         piece of cheap goods. But who am I 
                         to talk?

               Her eyes are full of tears.

                                     RONNY
                         What's the matter?

                                     LORETTA
                         How can you ask me that?

                                     RONNY
                         You're making me feel guilty again.

                                     LORETTA
                         You are guilty. I'm guilty.

                                     RONNY
                         Of what? Only God can point the 
                         finger, Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know what I know.

                                     RONNY
                         And what do you know? You tell me my 
                         life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a 
                         wolf? You run to the wolf in me, 
                         that don't make you no lamb! You're 
                         gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna 
                         sell your life short? Playing it 
                         safe is just about the most dangerous 
                         thing a woman like you could do. You 
                         waited for the right man the first 
                         time, why didn't you wait for the 
                         right man again?

                                     LORETTA
                         He didn't come!

                                     RONNY
                         I'm here!

                                     LORETTA
                         You're late!

                                     RONNY
                         We're here.

               EXT. RONNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               She looks. It's Ronny's building.

                                     LORETTA
                         This is your place.

                                     RONNY
                         That's right.

                                     LORETTA
                         This is where we're going!

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah.

                                     LORETTA
                         The deal was if I came to the Opera 
                         with you you'd leave me alone forever.

               She looks for his response. He makes none.

                                     LORETTA
                         I went with you.
                              (pause, nothing)
                         Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're 
                         gonna leave me alone.
                              (pause, nothing)
                         Right?
                              (nothing)
                         A person can see where they've messed 
                         up in their life, and they can change 
                         how they do things, and they can 
                         change their Luck. Maybe my nature 
                         does draw me to you, but I don't 
                         haveta go with that. I can take hold 
                         of myself and say yes to some things 
                         and no to something that's just gonna 
                         ruin everything! I can do that. 
                         Otherwise, what is this stupid life 
                         that God gave us for what?
                              (pause, nothing)
                         Ronny? Are you listening to me?

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm really afraid.

                                     RONNY
                         Why?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm afraid of who I am.

                                     RONNY
                         I was.

                                     LORETTA
                         And you're not now?

               He shakes his head.

                                     LORETTA
                         Why not?

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know. Everything seems like 
                         nothing now against that I want you 
                         in my bed. I don't care if I burn in 
                         hell. I don't care if you burn in 
                         hell. The Past and Future is a joke 
                         to me now. I see that they're nothing, 
                         I see they ain't here. The only thing 
                         that's here is you. And me. I want 
                         you to come upstairs. Now. I tried 
                         to take everything last night, like 
                         you told me, but I couldn't. I 
                         couldn't take everything in a hundred 
                         years. It's the way we are. We 
                         compound each other.

                                     LORETTA
                         Let me go home.

                                     RONNY
                         No.

                                     LORETTA
                         Let me go home.

                                     RONNY
                         No.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm freezing to death.

                                     RONNY
                         Come upstairs. I don't care why you 
                         come. No, that's not what I mean. 
                         Loretta, I love you. Not like they 
                         told you love is and I didn't know 
                         this either. But love don't make 
                         things nice, it ruins everything, it 
                         breaks your heart, it makes things a 
                         mess. We're not here to make things 
                         perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The 
                         stars are perfect. Not us. We are 
                         here to ruin ourselves and break our 
                         hearts and love the wrong people and 
                         die! The storybooks are bullshit. 
                         Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't 
                         try to live your life out to somebody 
                         else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't 
                         try to live on milk and cookies when 
                         what you want is meat! Red meat just 
                         like me! It's wolves run with wolves 
                         and nothing else! You're a wolf just 
                         like me! Come upstairs with me and 
                         get in my bed! Come on! Come on! 
                         Come on!

               Loretta follows Ronny into his building.

               NOW WE SEE THE STREET

               Just as the door shuts. A moment passes. Lights go on in 
               Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of 
               the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the 
               middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted 
               windows.

               NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY

               Her heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks 
               up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one 
               slender, slender thread.

               MUSIC

               It's "MIMI'S ARIA"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME.

               WE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING

               At the lighted window above. "MIMI'S ARIA" PLAYS. This tableau 
               reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in 
               the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long 
               moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy 
               shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She 
               hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks 
               away down the street.

               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - RUNWAY - NIGHT

               With a great and abrupt ROAR, a big jet is landing.

               INT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

               PASSENGERS are pouring into the terminal from the plane.

               Most of them are Italian or Italian-Americans. Suddenly, Mr. 
               Johnny appears out of the shifting crowd, up very CLOSE to 
               the CAMERA. He looks alert, determined, geared up for action.

               MR. JOHNNY AT THE LUGGAGE CAROUSEL

               He pulls his two suitcases off the carousel with one quick 
               powerful jerk.

               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

               Mr. Johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes 
               to him.

               INT. OF THE CAB

               Mr. Johnny leans forward to the DRIVER and says in a very 
               definite, determined way.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         19 Cranberry Street.

               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The cab rushes off into the night.

               EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               The cab pulling up to the Castorini house. The living room 
               windows are all lit up. VICKI CARR can be made out SINGING 
               "IT MUST BE HIM". Mr. Johnny gets out of the cab, gets his 
               luggage, and heads for the front door. He RINGS THE BELL.

               The door opens. It's Rose. MUSIC floods out around her.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Hello. I'm sorry to call so late...

               Rose is a little tipsy.

                                     ROSE
                         Moving in?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I came right from the airport.

                                     ROSE
                         Come on in.

               She holds the door open for him and he goes in past her 
               carrying his suitcases. She closes the door.

               INT. CASTORINI HOUSE  THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Can you wake up Loretta? I need to 
                         talk to her.

                                     ROSE
                         She's not home yet. Take off your 
                         coat and come in the living room. 
                         I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk 
                         to you.

               INT. CASTORINI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               Rose comes in with two scotches on the rocks. He takes one.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Thank you.

               She turns off the stereo, and then sits down across from 
               him.

                                     ROSE
                         So.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Where is she?

                                     ROSE
                         Out. I don't know where. I was waiting 
                         up for my husband.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         It's late.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes.

               There's a pause. Mr. Johnny is uncomfortable with it.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Maybe I should go?

                                     ROSE
                         What are you doing here? You're 
                         supposed to be in Palermo.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         That's what I came to tell Loretta. 
                         There's been a miracle.

                                     ROSE
                         A miracle. Well, that's news.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         My mother's recovered.

                                     ROSE
                         You're kidding?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         The breath had almost totally left 
                         her body. She was as white as snow. 
                         And then she completely pulled back 
                         from death and stood up and put on 
                         her clothes and began to cook for 
                         everyone in the house. The mourners. 
                         And me. And herself! She ate a meal 
                         that would choke a pig!

                                     ROSE
                         That's incredible.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Yes.

               The front door can be HEARD SLAMMING, out of view, and then 
               Dogs can be HEARD BARKING. Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the 
               entranceway. The Old Man appears there, holding the Five 
               Dogs.

                                     ROSE
                         Hello Pop.

               The Old Man looks at Rose. He is a specter. He stares, and 
               then he makes a long low accusing NOISE. Then he disappears.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Who was that?

                                     ROSE
                         That was my father-in-law, who has a 
                         wrong idea in his head. Listen, 
                         Johnny, there's a question I want to 
                         ask you. And I want you to tell me 
                         the truth if you can. Why do men 
                         chase women?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Well. There's the Bible story. God 
                         took a rib from Adam and made Eve. 
                         Maybe men chase women to get the rib 
                         back. When God took the rib, he left 
                         a hole there, place where there used 
                         to be something. and the women have 
                         that. Maybe a man isn't complete as 
                         a man without a woman.

                                     ROSE
                         But why would a man need more than 
                         one woman?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't know. Maybe because he fears 
                         death.

               Rose leaps up, very excited.

                                     ROSE
                         That's it! That's the reason!

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't know.

                                     ROSE
                         No, that's really it. Thank you for 
                         answering my question.

               The FRONT DOOR SLAMS again. Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the 
               entranceway. Cosmo appears there.

                                     COSMO
                         Hi.
                              (taking in Mr. Johnny)
                         Hi.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Hello, Mr. Castorini.

                                     ROSE
                         Where you been?

                                     COSMO
                         I don't know, Rose. I don't know 
                         where I've been, and I don't know 
                         where I'm going.
                              (to Mr. Johnny)
                         You should have your eyes opened for 
                         you, my friend.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I have my eyes open.

                                     COSMO
                         You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go 
                         on any long trips.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't know what you mean.

                                     COSMO
                         I know you don't. That's the point. 
                         I'll say no more.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         You haven't said anything.

                                     COSMO
                         And that's how much I'm saying.

                                     ROSE
                         Cosmo?

                                     COSMO
                         What?

                                     ROSE
                         I just want you to know. No matter 
                         what you do. You are going to die, 
                         just like everybody else.

                                     COSMO
                         Thank you, Rose.

                                     ROSE
                         You're welcome.

                                     COSMO
                         I'm going to bed now.

               Mr. Johnny stands up. Cosmo walks off, out of view.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I'm going.

                                     COSMO'S VOICE
                              (from top of stairs)
                         Good!

                                     ROSE
                              (to Mr. Johnny)
                         He doesn't like you. Thank you for 
                         answering my question.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         You don't know where Loretta is?

                                     ROSE
                         No idea.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Then tell her I'll come by in the 
                         morning. We need to talk.

                                     ROSE
                         Okay, I'll tell her.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAWN

               We watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house. It 
               begins in darkness, and goes through the many graduations of 
               light very quickly until it's lit by the light of bright 
               morning.

               THE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND THE OLD MAN AND THE DOGS COME OUT

               He's got them on their leashes and, over his head, he carries 
               the black umbrella. He walks off toward the park and 
               disappears.

               EXT. STREET - DAY - LORETTA IS WALKING

               Along a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. She is a wreck.

               She's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't 
               slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the 
               complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks 
               great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has 
               a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is 
               slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched 
               in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING. 
               We follow her as she SINGS and walks.

               WE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW

               She's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt. 
               She comes to it again. She kicks it again.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

               Loretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and 
               enters the house.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               Rose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and 
               sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal.

               Another range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles 
               into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down.

               There are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta.

                                     ROSE
                         What the hell happened to you?

                                     LORETTA
                         Well. I don't really know where to 
                         start.

                                     ROSE
                         Your hair's different.

                                     LORETTA
                         Everything's different.

                                     ROSE
                         Are you drunk?

                                     LORETTA
                         No. Are you drunk?

                                     ROSE
                         No. But I have a hangover.

                                     LORETTA
                         Where's pop?

                                     ROSE
                         Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up 
                         last night.

               Loretta is suddenly electrified.

                                     LORETTA
                         What? He's in Sicily!

                                     ROSE
                         No more he's not.

                                     LORETTA
                         He's with his dying mother!

                                     ROSE
                         She recovered.

                                     LORETTA
                         WHAT!! She was dying!

                                     ROSE
                         It was a miracle.

                                     LORETTA
                         A miracle? This is modern times! 
                         There ain't supposed to be miracles 
                         any more!

                                     ROSE
                         I guess it ain't modern times in 
                         Sicily. He came right from the 
                         airport. He wanted to talk to you. 
                         You got a love bite on your neck. 
                         He's coming back this morning.

               With a long low MOAN, Loretta lowers her head to the table.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta 
               just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he 
               hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown 
               leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts 
               to SING "O SOAVE FANCIULLA". He SINGS it any old way, 
               occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just 
               muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he 
               remembers, which is a lot.

               WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW

               He's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an 
               ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize 
               what he is singing. They start to SING along with him.

               They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a 
               resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other 
               appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back 
               to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

               Ronny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and 
               then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him 
               in.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN

               Rose walks in with Ronny behind her. There's no one in the 
               kitchen. Rose calls out.

                                     ROSE
                         It's not Johnny.

               Loretta comes out of a closet, where she was hiding. She's 
               very surprised to see Ronny.

                                     LORETTA
                         Ronny!

                                     RONNY
                         Is Johnny here?

                                     LORETTA
                         He's coming.

                                     RONNY
                         Good! We can get this out on the 
                         table.
                              (to Rose)
                         I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
                              (Shakes her hand)

                                     ROSE
                         Nice to meet you. You've got a love 
                         bite on your neck. Your mother's 
                         recovered from death.

                                     RONNY
                         Oh. Good. We're not close. I'm not 
                         really moved.

                                     LORETTA
                         You've gotta get outta here.

                                     RONNY
                         No. I'm gonna wait.

                                     LORETTA
                              (arguing with Ronny)
                         Ronny, please...

                                     ROSE
                         Would anyone like some oatmeal?

               LORETTA continues arguing.

                                     RONNY
                              (ignores Loretta)
                         Yes, I would like some oatmeal.

               Ronny and Loretta sit down and Rose serves them oatmeal.

               COSMO WALKS IN dressed for business. He regards the trio, 
               puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.

                                     ROSE
                         Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's 
                         brother.

                                     COSMO
                         His brother.

               Cosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of 
               him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he 
               puls down his spoon.

                                     COSMO
                         You're Johnny's brother?

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah.

               Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.

               The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.

               THE OLD MAN WALKS IN

               He looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him.

               He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his 
               hand opens in a gesture of supplication.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I am old. The Old are not wanted. 
                         And what they say has no weight. 
                         But, my son, I must speak. You should 
                         pay for the wedding of your only 
                         daughter. You are breaking your house 
                         through pride. There. I've said it.

                                     COSMO
                         It's okay, Pop. If she gets married, 
                         I'll pay for the whole thing.

               The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at 
               the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.

               He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.

               The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts 
               down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking 
               to Cosmo.

                                     ROSE
                         Have I been a good wife?

                                     COSMO
                         Yes.

                                     ROSE
                         I want you to stop seeing her.

               Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old 
               clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists 
               to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this. 
               Then slowly, he sits down.

                                     COSMO
                         Okay.

                                     ROSE
                         And go to confession.

                                     COSMO
                              (still not looking at 
                              her)
                         A man... under stands one day... 
                         that his life is built on nothing. 
                         And that's a bad, crazy day.

                                     ROSE
                         Your life is not built on nothing. 
                         Ti amo.

               She puts her hand across the table to him.

                                     COSMO
                         Ti amo.

               He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts 
               his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been 
               able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS.

                                     LORETTA
                         It's Johnny. I'll get it.

               Loretta's tone is fatal.

                                     RONNY
                         I'll get it.

               Rose gets up.

                                     ROSE
                         I'll get it.

               She goes to answer the door.

                                     RONNY
                              (goes for the door)
                         No, I'll tell him.

                                     LORETTA
                         No, I'll tell him.
                              (to her father)
                         What am I going to tell him?

                                     COSMO
                         Tell him the truth, Loretta they 
                         find out anyway.

               Loretta looks at her father.

                                     LORETTA
                         I love you Pop.

               It's a private moment.

               But who appears at the kitchen door is not Johnny. It's the 
               CAPPOMAGGIS.

               They have their coats on and they look very serious and 
               concerned and timid.

                                     RITA
                         Hi Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Hi, Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi. Why ain't you at the store?

                                     RITA
                         Is there anything you want to tell 
                         us, honey?

                                     LORETTA
                         You? No.

                                     RAYMOND
                         We just come from the bank.

                                     LORETTA
                         The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO 
                         MAKE THE DEPOSIT!

                                     RITA
                              (to Raymond)
                         She's got it.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I knew she had it.

               Loretta runs out of the kitchen and reappears with her 
               everyday bag. She takes out the night deposit bag and hands 
               it to Raymond.

                                     RITA
                         We didn't know what to think. You 
                         were so weird yesterday, and then 
                         this morning, we go to the bank and 
                         no bag.

                                     RAYMOND
                              (a sudden outburst to 
                              Loretta)
                         WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!

               Raymond covers his face to hide his emotion. Rita, meanwhile 
               is clearing the oatmeal bowls.

                                     ROSE
                         Listen. Who wants coffee?

               There is a general acknowledgment. Everybody wants coffee.

               Rose passes out white mugs and begins pouring steaming drafts 
               of coffee. Raymond and Rita are standing. The rest are 
               sitting.

                                     RITA
                         So what are we doing?

                                     ROSE
                         We're waiting for Johnny Cammareri.

               Rita nods. A silence.

                                     RONNY
                         I'm his brother.

                                     TA
                              (taking and shaking 
                              his hand)
                         Nice to meet you. I'm Rita Cappomaggi.

                                     RAYMOND
                              (taking and taking 
                              his hand)
                         I'm Raymond Cappomaggi. I'm Rose's 
                         brother.

                                     RONNY
                         Nice to meet you.

               Silence. Then the Old Man erupts.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Somebody tell a joke!

               The DOORBELL RINGS. And RINGS AGAIN. Everyone is frozen for 
               a moment, then Rita mobilizes.

                                     RITA
                         I'll get it.

               She goes. Loretta puts down her coffee and deep breathes, 
               preparing herself.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm getting palpitations!

               She pushes away her coffee.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I thought he was in Palermo.

               RITA APPEARS WITH MR. JOHNNY IN TOW

               Rita continues into the room, leaving Mr. Johnny in the 
               doorway. He is in a dark, vested suit. He is a little 
               bewildered by the crowd of people, but succeeds in hiding 
               most of his discomfort.

                                     RITA
                         It's Johnny Cammareri.

                                     LORETTA
                         Johnny.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Loretta...

                                     RONNY
                         Johnny...

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Ronny! Our mother has recovered from 
                         death!

                                     RONNY
                         Good.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Have you come to make peace with me?

                                     RONNY
                         Well. Yeah. You may not want to.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Of course I want to.

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't know. But Johnny, how did 
                         your mother recover? She was dying.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         We should talk alone.

                                     LORETTA
                         I can't. I need my family around me 
                         now.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Well. I told my mother that we were 
                         to be married. And she got well. 
                         Right away.

                                     RONNY
                         I'm sure she did.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         It was a miracle!

                                     LORETTA
                         Johnny, I have something to tell 
                         you.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I have something to tell you. But I 
                         must talk to you alone.

                                     LORETTA
                         I have no secrets from my family.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Loretta, I can't marry you.

                                     LORETTA
                         WHAT?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         If I marry you my mother will die.

               The Old Man laughs a loud sudden laugh, and then subsides.

                                     LORETTA
                         What the hell are you talking about? 
                         We're engaged.

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta, what are you talking about?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm talking about a promise. You 
                         proposed to me!

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Because my mother was dying! But now 
                         she's not.

                                     RONNY
                         You're forty-two years old, Johnny, 
                         and Mama is still running your life.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         And you are a son who doesn't love 
                         his mother!

                                     LORETTA
                         And you're a big liar! I've got your 
                         ring here!

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I must ask for that back.

               Loretta struggles and pulls off the ring.

                                     LORETTA
                         Here! Take your stupid pinky ring.
                              (she throws it at 
                              Johnny)
                         Who needs it? The engagement's off.

               Mr. Johnny retrieves the ring.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         In time, you will see that this is 
                         the best thing.

                                     LORETTA
                         In time, you will drop dead, and I 
                         will come to your funeral in a red 
                         dress.

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         What!

                                     RONNY
                         Will you marry me.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         What?

                                     LORETTA
                         Where's the ring?

               Ronny looks to Mr. Johnny a little sheepishly.

                                     RONNY
                         Could I a... borrow that ring.

               Mr. Johnny, in shock, hands it over to Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         Thanks.

               He kneels down before Loretta. He presents the ring to her.

                                     RONNY
                         Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini 
                         Clark?

                                     LORETTA
                         Before all these people, yes, I will 
                         marry you, Ronny Cammareri!

               She takes the ring. Ronny and Loretta kiss.

                                     ROSE
                         Do you love him, Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh God, that's too bad.

               Ronny and Loretta enter into a long kiss. The Old Man starts 
               to cry. Cosmo leans forward to the Old Man solicitously.

                                     COSMO
                         What's the matter, Pop?

                                     OLD MAN
                              (Lifts his head and 
                              cries out)
                         I'M CONFUSED !

               Loretta pushes Ronny away, breaking the kiss. They have both 
               neglected to breathe the whole time they were kissing.

               They are both gasping for air, especially Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

               But then she looks at Ronny, and lunges back to him, diving 
               into another kiss like a mermaid diving into the bluest ocean.

               MUSIC

               "O SOAVE FANCIULLA" from "La Boheme," COMES UP and engulfs 
               the lovers, the family, the world.

               WE SEE the faces of the lovers swirl away into a golden and 
               diamond light, and

                                                             DISSOLVE INTO:

               EIGHT FULL CHAMPAGNE GLASSES

               Glistening in sunlight on the white tabletop. Into each is 
               dropped a lump of sugar. A bottle of recently employed bitters 
               sits nearby with its cap off (like a respectful peasant in 
               aristocratic company. And the roses in the center.

               Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK. WE SEE the table is surrounded.

               Cosmo is dropping the last of the sugar cubes in the last 
               glass of champagne. Rose is by him. Rita and Raymond are 
               side by side, as are Ronny and Loretta. The Old Man sits, 
               staring at his son, intent and approving. But where is Mr. 
               Johnny?

                                     COSMO
                         Everybody take a glass.

               Everybody takes a glass. The Old Man takes one and gets up

                                     OLD MAN
                              (to Cosmo)
                         Wait.

               The Old Man takes the glass and walks over to a corner of 
               the kitchen where Mr. Johnny, deeply disturbed and somewhat 
               catatonic, sits on a step-ladder.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (continuing; to Mr. 
                              Johnny, offering the 
                              glass)
                         Here.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't want it.

               But the Old Man, wise and merry and tough, presses the glass 
               on Mr. Johnny, who takes it.

               COSMO, THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY NOW, LIFTS HIS GLASS

                                     COSMO
                         To... the family. Right? Ti amo.

               They all lift their glasses.

               CLOSE-UP OF ROSE'S FACE

                                     ROSE
                         Ti amo.

               CLOSE-UP OF RAYMOND AND RITA

                                     RAYMOND
                         That's right.

               Rita nods.

               A CLOSE-UP OF RONNY AND LORETTA DRINKING THEIR CHAMPAGNE

               And looking into each other's eyes.

               CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN

               Who knocks back his drink lustily, and then with a glittering 
               eye looks away from the table.

               MR. JOHNNY FROM THE OLD MAN'S POV

               Mr. Johnny sits without moving, holding his glass. A long 
               moment passes. Mr. Johnny is thinking. Then he nods to 
               himself. He lifts his glass and murmurs for no one to hear

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         To family.

               CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN LOOKING AWAY FROM MR. JOHNNY

               And he laughs his laugh. This laugh could kill him. The CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK a little. He pounds the table and knocks over the 
               roses.

               A CLOSE-UP OF THE RED ROSES ON THE WHITE TABLETOP CLOSING 
               BLACK CREDITS ROLL AGAINST THE WHITE BACKGROUND.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
Mrs.Brown

 


	MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Begin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. 
	Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
	a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN
	BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and
	right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his
	left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past
	saplings and plunges on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
	air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,
	bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. 
	Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he
	hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and
	races on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
	length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now
	there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps
	fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes
	forward, never stumbling once.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and
	stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow
	circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
	wildly swaying trees.

	There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins
	round, bellows deep from his heart:

				BROWN
		God save the Queen!!

	And fires.

	Nothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes
	on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into
	empty space.  A pause.

	Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
	him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,
	waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol
	drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. 
	And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have
	fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He
	shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He
	goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. 
	Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher
	and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1864"

						FADE IN:

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from
		Balmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned
		him, on one or two occasions, as being
		a most devoted outdoor servant to
		Prince Albert during his last days
		there...

	John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.

						 CUT TO:

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	The screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover
	that we are looking at a black night-gown.

	Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an
	elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... The depths of the Queen's sorrow
		remain impenetrable.  She has now
		restricted herself to a regime of such
		ferocious introspection that we are
		all at our wits' end...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk
	is laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his
	suits before laying it carefully on the bed.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... The Household continues, at her
		instruction, to observe the rituals
		now so familiar to her, in a vain
		attempt to render vivid that which can
		never be revived...

	Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed
	carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	The hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the
	widow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is
	set in a mask of severity.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... It will not surprise you to hear
		that she continues steadfast in her
		refusal to accept any public
		engagements, however trivial...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal
	bed.  His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.

	A somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:
	DOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician.  He is placing
	potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.

	Behind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and
	remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
	room.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... Family and staff expend all their
		efforts endeavouring to draw her out
		of this state of unfettered morbidity,
		but to no avail.  Indeed, Doctor
		Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
		her sanity, unless some remedy is
		found...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	VICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT
	DRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... We must hope, therefore, that this
		Mr Brown will appeal to the Queen's
		sentimental, though deeply-held, view
		that all Highlanders are good for the
		health.  If she can at least be
		persuaded to take the air, the
		prospect of further recovery may seem
		less remote...

	The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress. 
	VICTORIA winces slightly.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
			(terrified)
		Sorry, ma'am.

	EXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:
	"ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864."

	A DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart
	bearing the Royal coat of arms.

	John BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the
	waiting driver.  He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome
	and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... He is arriving by boat this
		afternoon, by which time it is hoped
		Her Majesty will be in a fit state to
		consider riding out...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY

	SIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is
	sitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... As to that decision, along with
		all others, we remain, as ever,
		prisoners of the Queen's grief.
			(beat)
		Ever your devoted husband, Henry.

	He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope.  He is a
	middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine
	and with a civil servant's stoop.  As he looks up, we see a
	white-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door. 
	PONSONBY hands the letter to him.

				PONSONBY (CONT'D)
		Windsor.

						 CUT TO:

	CAPTION: "OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT"

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	A series of windows are being slammed open by white
	stockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER
	HOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and
	rushing to make the luncheon hour.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Queen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two
	ladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying
	along a pace behind.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into
	the icy dining room and take their designated places at the
	luncheon table.  Everybody is dressed in mourning and
	nobody speaks.  Wind whistles through the open windows. 
	Silence.

	Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the
	Prince of Wales.  He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff
	dressed and balding.  He stands next to his young wife,
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,
	trying to keep warm.

	As BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER
	bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to
	PONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
	with the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.

				JENNER
		Congratulations, Your Royal Highness!

				BERTIE
		Thank you, Doctor.

				JENNER
		A boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent.

				BERTIE
		Yes.
			(beat)
		Albert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What
		do you think?

				PONSONBY
		A fine choice, sir.

				JENNER
		Excellent!

	EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the
	carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans
	in.

				DRIVER
		Are you riding up front?

	BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.

				BROWN
		I'll stay with the pony, thank you. 
		She's all the way from Deeside and
		she's not sure she likes you yet.

	The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
	breath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.

				VICTORIA
		How many?

	LADY ELY is slightly taken aback.

				LADY ELY
		The Royal Family and senior members of
		the household, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Just them?

				LADY ELY
		Yes, ma'am.

	VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps
	through the door.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the
	other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.

	She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else
	sits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by
	waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.

	It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA
	starts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the
	same.

	Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on
	down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns
	stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne
	House.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress
	curiously.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain
	pudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and
	whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
	finished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the
	routine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.

				JENNER
		We're expecting Brown this afternoon,
		ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Whom?

	A beat.  VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with
	her napkin and rises.  Everyone else rises too.  Suddenly,
	the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		That's a very pretty shawl you are
		wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.
			(beat)
		But you are not eating enough.  One
		must not let vanity overrule one's
		appetite.

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		Yes, ma'am.

	VICTORIA nods earnestly.  Lost to the effect her words have
	had, she marches out again.  Behind her, she leaves
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
	front of all the others.  BERTIE takes her hand and
	squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

	The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance
	and the DRIVER opens the doors.

	JOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
	the time.  His eyes narrow critically.

				BROWN
		I was due at a quarter past one.
			(beat)
		You're late.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	A few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long
	corridor with PONSONBY at his side.  Their journey takes
	them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and
	householders hurrying about their duties.  The presence of
	the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed
	portraits and busts that crop up along the way.

	BROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.

				PONSONBY
			(in low tones)
		Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House
		is not as you will remember it.  The
		Household remains in full mourning and
		no-one is permitted to raise their
		voice under any circumstances
		whatsoever.  As for the Queen's
		routine, she breakfasts at nine
		thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at
		five thirty and dinner at eight forty
		five.  No one is allowed to leave the
		building while the Queen is at home. 
		On the rare occasions when she is out,
		you may ask permission to leave, but
		only with my consent. 
		You're to be ready to walk the pony at
		any time after ten o'clock.  You'll
		clean her outdoor things and do any
		odd jobs as and when she requires.

				BROWN
		How will I know?

				PONSONBY
			(surprised to be interrupted)
		I'm sorry?

				BROWN
		How will I know what she requires?

				PONSONBY
		You'll be sent a message.

				BROWN
		Who'll bring it to me?

				PONSONBY
		Her Highness' Equerry.

				BROWN
		I need a man who knows where I am.

				PONSONBY
		I'm sure it won't be difficult to find
		you.

				BROWN
		That's not good enough.

	A beat.

				PONSONBY
		Then we'll have to see what can be
		arranged.

				BROWN
		Aye, do.

	PONSONBY stiffens.  A beat.

				PONSONBY
		There is to be no communication with
		other members of the household on
		matters concerning the court except
		through myself or one of the
		Equerries.  No plans must be altered
		unless you are given prior authority
		by myself or a senior member of the
		household.

				BROWN
		I came down at the Queen's request. 
		I'll take my orders from her.

				PONSONBY
		In matters concerning the Household, I
		act on her behalf.

	BROWN takes the measure of him.

				BROWN
		Do you?

				PONSONBY
		Yes.
			(beat)
		I do.

	BROWN glances up the corridor.

				BROWN
		So, is passing wind out of the
		question or do I need permission for
		that?

	PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They
	reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the
	interview.

				PONSONBY
		As I am sure you remember from
		Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her
		Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty
		addresses you directly.

	BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a
	moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY
	waits by the door.

				PONSONBY (O.S.)
		Mr Brown, ma'am.

	VICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her
	numerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter,
	underlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY
	ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. 
	She carries on working.

	BROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything
	are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince
	Albert glimpsed in the corridor.

	Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. 
	He steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks
	up and BROWN bows deeply.

	Silence.

	She stares at him for a long moment without apparently
	registering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright
	tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black
	and knotted with tension.

	Finally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Brown.

				BROWN
		Ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You are here safely.

				BROWN
		Aye, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You are well?

				BROWN
		I am.

				VICTORIA
		And the pony?

				BROWN
		She's well, too.

	VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is
	bringing him back.  A beat.

				VICTORIA
		Your family sent cards.  It was much
		appreciated.

				BROWN
		I'm glad of it.

	In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds
	the same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike
	others, seems unaffected.

				VICTORIA
		My husband was always very
		complimentary in speaking of you.  He
		would have approved, I am sure, of my
		calling on you in this way.
			(beat)
		I trust it does not inconvenience you
		too much.

				BROWN
		I've no family, ma'am, apart from my
		brothers and sisters.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.
			(beat)
		You have a brother in service here, do
		you not?
			(furrowing her brow)
		I forget his name.

				BROWN
		Archie.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.
			(beat)
		That will be company for you.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

	Silence.  VICTORIA starts to tire.  She takes a sip of
	water and spills a little on herself.  Flustered, she
	searches for a hanky but cannot find one.  LADY ELY hurries
	up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.  BROWN
	watches all of this with genuine concern.  When VICTORIA
	finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Honest to God, I never thought to see
		you in such a state.  You must miss
		him dreadfully.

	VICTORIA stares back in stunned silence.  PONSONBY coughs
	involuntarily.  LADY ELY freezes.  A beat.

				VICTORIA
		You do not - he ... get him out.
			(beat)
		Get him out.  Get him out!

	Suddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the
	room.  LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts
	herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Some minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk. 
	His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
	ferocity with which he slams down every object.

	His younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed.  He's in his
	early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same
	distinctive kilt and tweed.

				ARCHIE
			(telling it fast)
		So the day they arrive, she greets the
		Sultan and his family with barely a
		word and then retires to her chamber. 
		The Sultan, not used to State
		Occasions without a head of State, is
		standing in the lobby waiting for
		someone to tell him what to do.  But
		the court is under strict instructions
		not to talk in the corridors so nobody
		speaks to him, not a living soul, for
		the whole afternoon.  So now it's
		dinner and everyone's standing round
		the table -- still not a word --
		waiting for Her Majesty to arrive. 
		One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's
		getting a wee bit peckish to say the
		least.  So finally, his wee laddy
		breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
		slice in his mouth.  Well, the uproar
		when she heard.  You'd have thought
		someone had stolen the crown jewels.

	BROWN stares back, still pissed off.

				BROWN
		So?

				ARCHIE
		So, there are rules.  Things you do
		and things you don't do.

				BROWN
		I was just telling the woman how I
		feel, for God's sake.

				ARCHIE
		You don't tell Her Majesty how you
		feel.

				BROWN
		I speak as I find, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		Not down south you don't.

	BROWN slams a drawer shut.  ARCHIE lets it go and watches
	his brother.  A beat.

				ARCHIE (CONT'D)
		So what did Ponsonby do when she
		started shouting?

				BROWN
		I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

	A beat, then both men burst out laughing.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY

	The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
	hurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper
	Servant's huge table for dinner.  ARCHIE leads BROWN
	through this rush of activity.

				BROWN
		How much?

				ARCHIE
		Seventy a year.

				BROWN
		Not bad, not bad.

				ARCHIE
		How about yourself?

				BROWN
		Sixty.

				ARCHIE
			(grinning)
		That's pretty good for a ghillie.

	BROWN smiles dryly.  They pour themselves a drink from the
	table.

				BROWN
		Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who
		bleeds all day?  So what does his
		valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?

				ARCHIE
		It's better than shovelling horse
		shit.

				BROWN
		If you were looking for promotion, you
		should have picked one of the
		healthier ones.

				ARCHIE
		She's hardly a full hamper herself.

				BROWN
			(beat)
		It's only grief makes her like she is.

				ARCHIE
		Three years, John.  Is that not a bit
		long to be grieving?

				BROWN
		She loved him.

				ARCHIE
		Come on, man.  There's love and
		there's ...

				BROWN
		What?

				ARCHIE
		You know what I mean.

				BROWN
		I'm not sure I do, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		There's love and there's behaving like
		you do because there's nobody to tell
		you not to.

	Hold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the
	hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.

				BROWN
		Which one of us is she flirting with?

				ARCHIE
		The good-looking one.

				BROWN
		Aye?  Then she's obviously not got
		enough to do.

				ARCHIE
		You work the system right, you could
		ask her yourself.  Just be thankful
		you're not working for Household.  The
		Queen never lets them out of her
		sight.  But wee spats like us can slip
		through the net, easy.

	A beat.  BROWN stares straight at him.

				BROWN
		I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

	The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a
	corridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA
	suddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her
	entourage are several steps past her before they realize
	what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions
	behind.

	Now we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is
	standing in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches
	him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Some hours later.  It is now raining.

	A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage
	from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES
	frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John
	BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
	around him, laughing and giggling.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING

	Rain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite
	direction down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops
	at the same place as before.

				VICTORIA
			(as if she had not seem him
			 earlier)
		Who is that?

	Lady Ely peers through the rain.

				LADY ELY
		It's Mr Brown, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		What is he doing there?

				LADY ELY
		He appears to be ... standing by his
		horse.

				VICTORIA
		I made no request to go out riding
		today.
			(beat)
		How long has he been there?

				LADY ELY
		I don't know, ma'am.
			(nervously)
		He was observed earlier, I believe.

	At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the
		courtyard.  I have no wish to go
		riding.

				PONSONBY
		I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't
		imagine -- he was certainly given no
		instructions.

				VICTORIA
		Please make sure it does not happen
		again.

				PONSONBY
		Of course, at once.

	VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

	Half an hour later, PONSONBY stands at his desk facing
	BROWN.

				PONSONBY
		What on earth did you think you were
		doing?

	BROWN stares straight back.

				BROWN
		Awaiting my orders.

				PONSONBY
		You do not report for duty unless the
		Queen requests it.  You know that very
		well.

				BROWN
		I didn't come all this way to sit on
		my arse.

				PONSONBY
		You will await your orders like
		everyone else.  Unless you prefer a
		repeat of yesterday's little
		excitement.

				BROWN
		No.

				PONSONBY
		I beg your pardon?

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY

	The next day.  From a high window, we see PONSONBY
	scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
	JOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day
	before.

	VICTORIA watches impassively.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY

	PONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.

				PONSONBY
		I thought I made myself perfectly
		clear.  You do not leave your room
		until Her Majesty requests it.

				BROWN
			(eyes straight ahead,
			 shouting back)
		Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if
		her husband was here now, he'd have
		had her out of that house and getting
		some air in her.  What the hell's the
		point in me being here otherwise?!

	From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words.  A
	beat.  PONSONBY collects himself.

				PONSONBY
		Go inside at once.

				BROWN
		Is that the Queen's request?

				PONSONBY
		Yes, it most certainly is!

	BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back
	to the stables.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, STABLES - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling
	his horse.  Suddenly he turns.

	VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her
	entourage.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Brown.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You have been told repeatedly not to
		stand in the courtyard unless
		requested to do so.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Then why do you persist in doing it?

				BROWN
		Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. 
		If ever there was a poor soul who
		needed fresh air, it is her.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA
		The Queen will ride out if and when
		she chooses.

				BROWN
		And I intend to be there when she's
		ready.

	Silence.  The two of them stare at each other.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured
	landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the
	distance, the glittering sea.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in
	silence.

	EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY

	VICTORIA looks up.

				VICTORIA
		Prince Albert was going to build a
		bench here.  He thought it one of the
		best views in Osborne.

				BROWN
		It's a fine spot, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		He thought so, yes.

	She stares ahead.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		In everything I do and everything I
		say, I try to think, as much as
		possible, what he would do, or say, if
		he were here now.  My Private
		Secretary wishes me to return to
		public duties--

	She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.

				BROWN
		If Prince Albert were here today, he'd
		tell him a thing or two.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish
		it.
			(beat)
		The same people who refused to grant
		my husband the title of King because
		he was deemed of insufficient rank--

	She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		It is a fine spot for a bench, is it
		not?

				BROWN
		Aye, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.

	A pause.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I have some letters in the saddle bag. 
		I wish to read them.

	BROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands
	her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I cannot read them like that.

	BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again.  VICTORIA cuts in.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		You will hand them to me as I require.

	BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER
	SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS
	prepare to serve soup.

	ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
	next to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in.

	But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he
	goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
	down.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room
	stops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with
	a look.

	An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
	amazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,
	hurries up to intercede.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits
		there.

				BROWN
		Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		By whose authority?

				BROWN
		My own.

	A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness.  BERTIE'S VALET stares
	icily at him.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		The order of seating at the Upper
		Servant's table is arranged personally
		by the Queen herself.

				BROWN
		That's a tautology lad.
			(unable to stop himself
			 seriously explaining it)
		If you say the Queen arranges
		something, you've no need to say she's
		done it personally.  That's
		understood.

	But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He
	stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of
	the under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried
	exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.

	Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a
	substantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty
	assistant dresser, sitting to his right.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Are you dresser to Her Majesty?

	She blinks nervously at him.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Assistant, sir, yes.

	BROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits.

				BROWN
		What's your name?

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Mary Taylor, sir.

				BROWN
		Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		I hope to go up next year.

				BROWN
		You wouldn't happen to know what the
		Queen's reading for recreation, would
		you, Mary?

	The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Lord Tennyson, sir?

	BROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant
	bursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly
	from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The
	old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
	table.

	BROWN looks up from his soup.

				BROWN
		Am I the only one eating?

	With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	A few days later.  A morning "drawing room."  Standing
	round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY
	CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that
	whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits
	knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat
	buttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself
	opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. 
	He runs through the daily itinerary.

				PONSONBY
		Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,
		at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve
		by a picnic in the grounds to
		celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. 
		Dispatches, as usual, at two.
			(finishes, then coughs)
		The Chancellor writes to say that, by
		happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes
		for the weekend.  He asks if Your
		Majesty might grant him an audience.

				VICTORIA
		Why?

				PONSONBY
		He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty
		might wish to be informed of the
		latest developments in government.

				VICTORIA
		No.  I shall be out walking.

	A beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs
	again, nervous.

				PONSONBY
		Then perhaps Your Majesty might
		consider it opportune if the Prince of
		Wales were to meet him on your behalf?

	VICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning.

				VICTORIA
		On no account.

	PONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up
	the reins.

				BERTIE
		Mama, I really do think it's time we
		made ourselves a little more ...
		available.

	VICTORIA carries on knitting.

				BERTIE (CONT'D)
		I think we must accept our position in
		the country is not entirely unrelated
		to the continued absence of the
		Monarchy from public life.
			(silence)
		I thought perhaps we might consider a
		small gesture of some kind?

	VICTORIA looks up sharply.

				VICTORIA
		Gesture?

				BERTIE
		I thought, a dinner for our
		ambassadors perhaps?

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in firmly)
		No dinners, Bertie.
			(beat)
		Why are you dressed for outdoors?

				BERTIE
		It's so infernally cold in here.

				VICTORIA
		Cold is good--
			(calling across)
		Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!

				JENNER
		I'm sorry, ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Cold is good!

				JENNER
		Excellent, ma'am, excellent.
			(trying his hand)
		But perhaps if her Majesty were to
		consider accompanying her new-found
		physical vigor with the benefits of
		mental activity...

				VICTORIA
			(becoming very agitated)
		Why am I being lectured in this way?!

				JENNER
		Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way
		did I wish to suggest--

				VICTORIA
			(cutting across him)
		I will not tolerate anybody lecturing
		me about the responsibility of the
		monarchy....

				BERTIE
		Mother....

				VICTORIA
		... Least of all my son.  It was his
		irresponsibility that drove my husband
		to his grave.

	An appalled silence.  With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs
	the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
	in another direction.

				BERTIE
		If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,
		then perhaps she might consider
		allowing the Prince of Wales to host--

				VICTORIA
		I do believe they send so many boxes
		to taunt me. 
		Doctor Jenner writes to them to say
		that my nerves are in an extremely
		fragile state and yet they continue to
		hound me with box after box after box
		after box after box!

	Silence.  VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out
	at the view.  Having recovered her composure, she turns to
	address them all.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I wish to take the Princesses for a
		swim.

	For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard.  She
	continues.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		The turns I have been taking in the
		grounds have proved most beneficial to
		me, and Brown thinks that salt water
		will do me good.

	Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR
	JENNER exchange a worried look.

	EXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen
	VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck
	into the freezing sea.  As she does so, the doors of the
	other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise
	follow her in.  Dignity does not allow them to shout out,
	but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.

	VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little
	circle.

				VICTORIA
		Don't potter, children.  Swim.

	Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

	Half an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and
	two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and
	onto her horse.  He glances at the stiff line of
	householders and mutters curtly to himself.

				BROWN
		You could buy that lot for garden
		ornaments and still see change from
		ten guineas.

	The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has
	overheard and tries to suppress a smile. 
	As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose. 
	BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Lift your foot, woman.

	Everyone hears this.  VICTORIA obeys.  Taking the reins, he
	then walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard.  As they vanish
	from site, we hear...

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		This nation is fortunate in so much as
		it is not governed by force...

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1866"

						FADE IN:

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

	The speech continues as we follow the progress of a
	Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches
	from knee to knee.  It is entitled, "Where is Britannia?"
	and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		... but by a chain of traditions that
		have been cherished from generation to
		generation, because in them -- in our
		traditions -- are embodied all the
		laws which have enabled us to create
		the greatest empire of modern times...

	During the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and
	lands on the knees of the young, earnest STANLEY.  As he
	frowns at the picture in front of him, DISRAELI winds up.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		... but, even though we have amassed
		great capital and even though we have
		established an industry with no
		parallel in the world, yet all these
		mighty creations are as nothing
		compared to the invisible customs that
		shape our lives.  To those honorable
		gentlemen of the opposition who seek
		to destroy the essential elements of
		this country, I say let them remember:
		England cannot begin again.

	During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time. 
	He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like
	Dickens on Slimfast.  He dresses almost dandyishly but
	speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance
	and cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back
	benchers, he sits.

	As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the
	Liberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every
	respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.  They stare
	levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
	smile.

	STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap.

				STANLEY
		Have you seen this?

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY

	A few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling
	down the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory
	back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
	offer their congratulations.

				STANLEY
		Should we take it seriously?

				DISRAELI
		The cartoon or Her Majesty's
		absenteeism?

				STANLEY
		Well, both.

				DISRAELI
		The question is, do we need her?

				STANLEY
		Surely, you're not suggesting we
		dispense--

				DISRAELI
		My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with
		only a handful of friends must respect
		public opinion.

	The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was
		right.  This country is not governed
		by wisdom but by talk.
			(beat)
		Granted, it wouldn't take much to
		winkle the old girl out of mourning,
		but if public opinion is against her,
		then it doesn't do to appear too
		close.

				STANLEY
		So?

				DISRAELI
		We'll see which way the wind blows.

	DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.

	EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.  It is freezing. 
	BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing
	Burns at the sea.

				BROWN
		My heart's in the Highlands, my heart
		is not here!  My heart's in the
		Highlands a-chasing the deer!  Chasing
		the wild deer and following the roe! 
		My heart's in the Highlands wherever I
		go!

	ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns.

	EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the
	cold beach to rub themselves dry.  BROWN is very energized.

				BROWN
		One box of biscuits, one box of drop
		tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen
		chocolate sponges.  It's the same
		order every week, but does anybody
		bother to check it?  Now she has to
		travel all the way to Balmoral without
		the few luxuries she actually enjoys.

				ARCHIE
		So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.

				BROWN
		Aye, but will they?

				ARCHIE
		John, it's not your problem what she
		eats.

				BROWN
		The woman's surrounded by fools!
			(beat)
		She has to be packed and ready to
		leave by seven thirty tomorrow
		morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll
		still be dressing her at eight.

	BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his
	brother.

				ARCHIE
		She's got an army of people to get her
		up and out.

				BROWN
		But I'm the only one she trusts.

	ARCHIE stares at him.  A beat.

				ARCHIE
		She'll blow hot and cold on you, John,
		she always does.  You want to be
		careful.

				BROWN
		I'm on ninety pounds a year plus
		seventy pounds for a pile of tartan
		I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much
		as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and
		that job's only for toffs.
			(raising his hip flask
			 triumphantly at the sea)
		I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! 
		Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping
		me now.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT

	A few days later.

	The clatter of carriage and horse as the ROYAL PARTY
	thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle.

	CAPTION: "BALMORAL"

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - TWILIGHT

	A mass of torches encircle the ROYAL PARTY as kilted
	GHILLIES and STAFF swarm round the carriage, opening doors
	and clambering off boxes while a regiment of PIPERS play
	them in.

	Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the
	door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by
	PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE.  Emerging from another
	carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim
	faced at the castle.  HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER
	alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves
	and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.

				PONSONBY
		Oh God, not the pipes!

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The next day.

	High over the vast, bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch
	Muick.  VICTORIA and BROWN are riding fast towards the top. 
	Reaching the summit, VICTORIA points excitedly at the far
	horizon.

				VICTORIA
		What are those?

				BROWN
		What?

				VICTORIA
		Those, over there, there.

				BROWN
			(horse chestnut trees...)
		Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.

				VICTORIA
			(beat)
		Craobhan-geanmchno...
			(bursts out laughing)
		How can I possibly say that with a
		straight face?!

	BROWN lets it go and they ride on.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I am thinking of publishing my
		"Highland Journals."

				BROWN
		Are they worth reading?

				VICTORIA
			(beat)
		I am told so.

				BROWN
		Who by?

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are
		charming.

				BROWN
		What does he know about the Highlands?

				VICTORIA
		He has been attending at Balmoral for
		many years.

				BROWN
		That doesn't make him an expert.

				VICTORIA
		His remarks were directed at the
		quality of the writing, not its
		subject.

				BROWN
		I don't groom a horse to have it
		admired by others, I groom it because
		it needs grooming.

				VICTORIA
			(curtly)
		I do not do it for others.  But
		Ponsonby thinks they are good.

				BROWN
		Just say what you have to say, woman. 
		What other people think shouldn't
		matter to you.

				VICTORIA
			(snapping)
		Of course I shall say what I have to
		say.  I always do.

	The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on.

				BROWN
		Aye, well, if all you want is a good
		opinion then he'd be sure to oblige
		you.

				VICTORIA
			(riding alongside)
		What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was
		their literary merit, a skill not
		intimately associated with the
		knowledge of grooming.
			(beat)
		Literary appreciation does not begin
		and end with Tennyson.

	BROWN lowers his head.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
			(in a softer tone)
		I mention you in them.

	BROWN says nothing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		In particular, the occasion when
		Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage
		overturned during a storm and you
		demonstrated such loyal service in
		returning the Queen and the Princesses
		safely to Balmoral.

	Taking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds
	it out to him.  A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		For friendship.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	A few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand
	at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary.

				BROWN
			(briskly)
		She'll be away on Friday between eight
		o'clock and six in the evening to
		visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's
		to make the journey there and back in
		the day she's to have no distractions
		the night before.  She'll take a light
		supper alone in her private drawing
		room and retire early.

				PONSONBY
		She'll need to sign dispatches before
		she retires.

				BROWN
		That can wait till the weekend.

				PONSONBY
		There are important papers from --

				BROWN
		It can wait.  Anything else?

				JENNER
		Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such
		a long journey?  She has only just
		recovered from a severe head cold.

				BROWN
		If I thought she wasn't up to it, I
		wouldn't let her go, would I?

	BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving
	PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	The next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the
	grounds.  VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one
	side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.

	BERTIE is in mid-plea.

				BERTIE
		Surely it is for the gentlemen to
		decide when to stop...

				VICTORIA
		It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It
		should be discouraged.

				BERTIE
		Yes, but isn't midnight a little
		excessive?

				VICTORIA
		It is quite late enough.

				BERTIE
		But mama, the room was built expressly
		for that purpose.  It has been a
		smoking-room by tradition ever since
		father --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in angrily)
		Brown's responsibilities are onerous
		enough already.  He has far too much
		to do without having to stay up all
		night waiting for you to go to bed. 
		The smoking-room will be closed and
		the lights put out at twelve o'clock.

				BERTIE
		Mama...

				VICTORIA
		And that is my last word on the
		matter.

				BERTIE
		Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think
		it's too much that the gentlemen of
		the house should be dictated to by a
		servant.

				BROWN
		It's the Queen's decision.

				BERTIE
		I beg your pardon?
			(to VICTORIA)
		Mama...?

	Before Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his
	face.

				BROWN
		I think you should go now.
			(beat)
		You've tired your mother enough.

	BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.  He glances at
	his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if
	she has not heard.  BERTIE turns and storms away.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	JOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage
	watching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple,
	MR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying
	desperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden
	visit.  They fling open the windows, slosh water on the
	fire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions,
	dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
	up, all in the space of a few seconds.

				BROWN
		There's really no need for this.

				MRS GRANT
		I'll not have her seeing it like it
		is!
			(beat)
		I know she means well, but I wish
		she'd warn us she was coming.

				BROWN
		She thinks if she warned you, you'd go
		pouring water on the fire and stuffing
		the knitting under the sofa.

				MR GRANT
		Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being
		house-proud.

	MRS GRANT surveys the room critically.

				MRS GRANT
		All right.
			(beat)
		Show her in.

	EXT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA sits on a horse and trap.  BROWN steps out and
	helps her down.

				BROWN
		They're ready now.

				VICTORIA
		I hope they didn't go to any trouble,
		John.

				BROWN
		Ah, well...

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one
	military row, smoke still steaming off the fire.  BROWN
	stands behind her, barely able to contain himself.  But for
	VICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as
	perfectly normal.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Grant.  How good it is to see you.

				MR GRANT
			(bowing deeply)
		Your Majesty.

				VICTORIA
		Mrs Grant.  How is your knee?  Has the
		pain eased a little?

				MRS GRANT
			(bobbing in terror)
		Oh not so bad, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Good.  Oh and here are Douglas and
		John.  Haven't you grown?

				MRS GRANT
			(still bobbing away)
		Growing all the time, ma'am.

	MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a
	chair.

				MR GRANT
		Will you sit, ma'am?

	From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she
	smiles as she is led to the chair.  She points to a picture
	on the wall and her good humour is infectious.

				VICTORIA
		I know that!  That's Cairn Lochan.  We
		picnicked there once, did we not,
		John?

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS,
	DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES.  Into this
	brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the
	young STANLEY.  It is all eyes and nods here.  Everyone
	knows everyone.

				DISRAELI
		Ah, the greasy pole.

				MARY ANNE
		Don't be facetious, dear. Remember
		your position.

				DISRAELI
		It's my position I'm thinking of.

	Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of
	acolytes.

				STANLEY
		I see the Prince of Wales is here.

				DISRAELI
		I hope he got his mother's permission.

	STANLEY smiles faintly.  DISRAELI homes in on a punter and
	raises his hand, already working the room.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		Lord Salisbury!

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	The society party is hotting up.  STANLEY is deep in
	conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
			(ridiculously pleased with
			 herself)
		Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound
		foolish?  Because she looks after the
		Browns and lets the sovereigns take
		care of themselves!

	A peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up.

				DISRAELI
		And in your opinion?  Is she foolish?

	The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
		Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's
		hardly right, is it?

				DISRAELI
		What?

				SOCIETY LADY 1
		Well, the Queen and --
			(appalled whisper)
		Mr Brown.

	DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.

				DISRAELI
		La superstition met le monde entier en
		flammes.

				SOCIETY LADY 2
			(thick as shit)
		I beg your pardon?

				DISRAELI
			(changing tack)
		Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown?

				STANLEY
		He is her personal servant, I believe.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
			(knowingly)
		Follows her wherever she goes.

				DISRAELI
		He would hardly make a very good
		personal assistant if he did not.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of
	QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS
	GRANT nervously prattles on.

				MRS GRANT
		... it's not my best china.  I mean,
		it is my best china now, but the
		family set got stolen last summer.

				VICTORIA
		Oh, I'm so sorry ...

				MRS GRANT
		Of course it was no-one on the Estate. 
		More likely one of the lads from
		Braemar.  Or further even.
			(beat)
		I'll fetch the salt.

	MRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the
	spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside
	the plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries
	on.

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES.

				BERTIE
		Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.

				DISRAELI
		Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure
		to see you here.

				BERTIE
		Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in
		sugar...?

				DISRAELI
		I don't think I've had that pleasure.

	DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles
	with drink.  MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while
	BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.

				BERTIE
		No doubt you've heard the rumors.

				DISRAELI
		I take no account of gossip, Your
		Highness.

				BERTIE
		My concern is for the reputation of
		the Monarchy.

				DISRAELI
		Of course.

				BERTIE
		I fear the influence he has on her. 
		The man's word is not to be credited. 
		He is an arriviste of the very lowest
		water.
			(beat)
		She's having a bust cast of him.  In
		Nero Marquino marble.

				DISRAELI
		I see.

				BERTIE
		I would talk to her myself, but she
		won't listen to me.  She must be
		persuaded, by someone she respects, to
		abandon this ridiculous favoritism
		before a situation develops.

				DISRAELI
		A situation?

				BERTIE
		I don't imagine you frequent the
		Republican Clubs.  But the fact that
		neither you nor I are members should
		not blind us to the significance of
		their existence.
			(beat)
		The Tory Party has always been our
		party.

				DISRAELI
		I'm flattered you think so.

				BERTIE
		I tell you, if we don't stick together
		on this, you could find yourself First
		President's Opposition.
			(murdering it)
		Du Royaum Uni.

				DISRAELI
		Quite.

	A beat.

				BERTIE
		I don't think we can overstate the
		seriousness of this.

	DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party. 
	The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.

				STANLEY
		What did he want?

				DISRAELI
		To know when he'll be king.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large
	table.  Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams
	proudly at BROWN as he tells a story.

				BROWN
		... so Grant here and myself are
		riding over Lochnagar and the rain's
		pouring down in sheets and all we're
		thinking about is getting home for a
		drink, when through the gloom Grant
		spots a couple of poachers.  He gives
		me a shout and we chase them down
		towards the loch until Grant has your
		men up against the stacks and he's
		shouting and cursing at them, "Why are
		you poaching on Royal land?!"  And one
		of the little fellas looks up at him
		and says, "coz we've come up in the
		world."

	For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then
	BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS
	relax.  Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. 
	Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal
	quantities of whiskey all round.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DUSK

	Later that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of
	worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps.

	Through the light, BROWN and VICTORIA clatter into the
	courtyard on the horse and trap.  DOCTOR JENNER breaks
	through the crowd in a state of high excitement.

				JENNER
		Your Majesty!  Thank goodness you're
		safe!  I'll have a bath prepared
		immediately.  I recommend Macdonald's
		African Embrocation --

				BROWN
			(cutting in)
		Ah, pipe down, man.  The woman's fine.

				VICTORIA
		We stayed a little longer than
		expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It
		was most agreeable.

				PONSONBY
		We were expecting you to return by
		six.

				VICTORIA
		And now I am back.

	BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.

				BROWN
		We took a nip of whiskey.

				VICTORIA
		To keep out the cold.

				BROWN
		Aye.

	VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before
	walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...

				VICTORIA
		Thank you, John.

	BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up,
	he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in
	utter disbelief at what she has just said.  He turns and
	leads the horse back to the stables.

				JENNER
			(under his breath)
		She's drunk.

	PONSONBY doesn't answer.  He is watching BROWN very
	closely.

				JENNER (CONT'D)
		A distinct flushing around the cheeks. 
		She was drunk, I tell you.

				PONSONBY
		No, she wasn't.

	Silence.  JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY.

				JENNER
		Surely not ...

	PONSONBY's face is set hard.

				PONSONBY
		Don't even think about it.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

	A crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of
	the annual Ghillie's Ball.

	The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them
	beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and
	JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.

	PONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching.  Close-up
	on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly.

				JENNER
		Pandora's Box ...

	With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and
	BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence. 
	A King and his Queen.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Later that night.

	We find BROWN, slouched on the ground, dead-drunk and
	snoring loudly.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	A few days later, four JOURNALISTS are scrabbling up a
	stony path, armed with telescopes.

	BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS scramble up to some gorse bushes, dump
	themselves down and start setting up the telescopes.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	BROWN and VICTORIA near the summit when BROWN suddenly
	stops.  He stiffens and turns to face the wind, as if
	catching a scent.  VICTORIA frowns.

				VICTORIA
		What is it, John?
			(beat)
		John?

				BROWN
		I heard something.

	BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		I won't be long.

	He dismounts and races off.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS are peering through their telescopes.

				JOURNALIST 1
		Where did he get to?  I've lost him?

	Below them, BROWN races across the riverbank and
	undergrowth, unseen.

				JOURNALIST 2
		I don't know if there's much worth
		writing about.

				JOURNALIST 1
		Hard to tell.

	BROWN rears up above them and stops.

				BROWN
		This close enough for you?  Go on!  On
		your way!  You filthy scavengers!

	The JOURNALISTS scramble to their feet and start legging it
	down the hill, while BROWN roars furiously, hurling their
	bags after them.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		You leave her alone, do you hear?!

	The JOURNALISTS vanish below the hillside.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	That night.

	BROWN is standing at the head of the table, yelling at the
	UPPER SERVANTS, irrespective of ARCHIE or anyone.

				BROWN
		If I catch the miserable by-blow who
		told those men where she'd be, then
		I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock
		Wemyss, so I will!!

	ARCHIE glances up at BERTIE'S VALET.  He is staring down at
	the table, teeth gritted, fists clenched.  BROWN rounds on
	them all again.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		What happens to John Brown is his
		business, but the Queen's security
		will never be compromised!

				BERTIE'S VALET
		We --

				BROWN
		You'll talk when I'm finished!

	BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns
	back to the table.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		That kind of disloyalty will not be
		tolerated in this house, is that
		clear?
			(beat, yelling)
		I said, is that clear?!

	There is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and
	storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

	A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to
	his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his
	copy of Punch.

				JENNER
		"Court Circular, Balmoral."
			(beat)
		"On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a
		display of sheep-dipping by local
		farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a
		seance where he was pleased to listen
		to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr
		Robert Burns himself ..."

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same
	journal.

				JENNER (O.S.)
		"... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked
		on the slopes, accompanied by family
		and friend ..."

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door.

				JENNER (O.S.)
		Mr Brown retired early.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

	BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his
	copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled.

				BROWN
		If I find out that you had anything to
		do with this, I will have you sacked.

				PONSONBY
		I believe that decision rests with Her
		Majesty.

				BROWN
		Don't think I can't persuade her.

				PONSONBY
		I don't doubt that the Queen was
		highly amused.  She has always had a
		very healthy sense of humor.

				BROWN
		This is a slur on her good name.

				PONSONBY
		In as much as the article is about
		yourself, I think you must now accept
		that the public has a right to its
		interest in you.

				BROWN
		Nobody has any rights over me.

				PONSONBY
		We are all of us subject to forces
		beyond our control, Mr Brown, even
		you.

	BROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat.

				BROWN
		You'll regret saying that.

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

	Chaos.  The Tories are losing the vote as both sides of the
	house stand and shout at each other while the SPEAKER rises
	in his chair.

				SPEAKER (O.S.)
		Order!  Order!  ORDER!

	A buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote. 
	The COUNTERS approach the chair.

				SPEAKER (CONT'D)
		Result of the vote to the first
		reading of the Bill to Disestablish

	A murmur of excitement from the LIBERALS.

				SPEAKER (CONT'D)
		Order!

	A beat.

				COUNTER
		Ayes to the right, three hundred and
		thirty, noes to the left, two hundred
		and sixty-five...

	By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in
	cheers from the Liberal benches.  DISRAELI and the rest of
	the front bench sit in stony silence.

	Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed
	maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting:

				DILKE
		Mr Speaker, I table a motion in
		furtherance of the Bill to
		Disestablish the Monarchy!

	A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again.

				SPEAKER
		Order!  Order!!  ORDER!!!

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	An hour later the house is empty except for a few
	straggling MPs hurrying home.  An exhausted DISRAELI stands
	in the corridor with STANLEY.

				DISRAELI
		We're going to lose.

				STANLEY
		You can't know that for sure.

				DISRAELI
		Gladstone's got his party facing the
		same way for the first time in years. 
		We need help.
			(long beat)
		Where is the old girl?

				STANLEY
		Who?

				DISRAELI
		Mrs Brown.

				STANLEY
		It's questionable whether there's any
		advantage to be had from that
		direction.  She's never been less
		popular.

				DISRAELI
		In the press, perhaps.
			(holding up Punch)
		But she's sold more copies of her
		Highland Journal in three months than
		Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time
		to wheel her out.

				STANLEY
		She's refusing to leave Balmoral.

				DISRAELI
		What's her excuse this time?

				STANLEY
		The Princess Louisa is too ill to
		move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather
		upset at the recent spate of bad
		publicity.
			(beat)
		You're smiling.

				DISRAELI
		I was trying to imagine "rather
		upset."

	The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the
	lobby doors.  DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.

				DISRAELI
		Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to
		spare the time.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		I came as quickly as I could.

				DISRAELI
		You've seen the latest cartoon in
		Punch, I take it?

				DEAN WELLSELLY
			(completely lost)
		I beg your pardon?

	DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean
	Wellselly.  The Dean clears his throat and starts to read.

				DISRAELI
			(as Wellselly reads)
		One of our madder brethren in the
		house was calling for disestablishment
		of the monarchy.

	Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Good Lord.

				STANLEY
			(playing the soft glove)
		I'm sure it won't come to that.

				DISRAELI
			(the hard glove)
		No.  But it has now become a matter
		for our consciences.
			(beat)
		I was just telling Stanley how vital
		it is that the nation should feel the
		visible influence of the Sovereign. 
		As a reminder that Parliament, indeed
		my own ministry, depends on the will
		of the Queen.

	DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely.  Over his shoulder,
	STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the
	party political maneuver into a moral imperative.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		I couldn't agree with you more, but I
		am only Dean of Windsor.  I don't
		understand what ...

	DISRAELI interrupts.

				DISRAELI
		We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is
		interesting Her Majesty in some of the
		forms of worship associated with ...
		low-church Presbyterian.

	Silence.  DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of
	unrestrained horror.  Low-church.  Presbyterian.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		What can we do?

				DISRAELI
		Oh, several things.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Some days later.

	Queen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands
	in front of her, holding a copy of The Times.

				VICTORIA
		Read it.

				PONSONBY
		Again?

				VICTORIA
		Read it!

	PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.

				PONSONBY
		"The Times wishes to join the rest of
		Her Majesty's loyal subjects in
		expressing its deep joy at the news
		that the Queen is soon to come out of
		her mourning."

	VICTORIA glowers at him.

				VICTORIA
		Who told them that?

				PONSONBY
		I have no idea.

				VICTORIA
		Why not?

				PONSONBY
		I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser
		than yourself.

	Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him.

				VICTORIA
		No-one should think themselves wiser
		than me!
			(beat)
		It is not for any of the Queen's
		subjects to presume to tell Her
		Majesty when and where She should come
		out of mourning.  It is the Queen's
		sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is
		Her overwhelming amount of work and
		responsibility, work which She feels
		will soon wear her out entirely!

				PONSONBY
		Your Majesty --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting right through him)
		Is it not enough that She is uncheered
		and unguided that she should also have
		to suffer these malicious rumors?!
			(a pause, more quietly)
		I am not a fool.
			(beat)
		I know there are those in the
		establishment too afraid to attack me
		and so they attack my dearest friends. 
		Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all
		I have left of Albert.
			(beat)
		And now they attack Brown too.

	She looks up, eyes blazing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I will not give him up to them.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, ROOM ADJOINING DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	BROWN is guarding the door to the drawing room while the
	balding BERTIE muscles up, eye ball to eye ball.

				BERTIE
		I wish to see my mother.

				BROWN
		She's busy.

				BERTIE
		Convey her a message.

				BROWN
		She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk
		to her there.

				BERTIE
		Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to
		speak with her urgently about matters
		concerning the press.

				BROWN
		Are you deaf as well as stupid?

	A split-second.  BERTIE gapes at him.

				BERTIE
		What did you say?

				BROWN
		I said, are you deaf as well as
		stupid?

				BERTIE
		Do you know who you address, sir?

				BROWN
		Whom you address.

				BERTIE
		The future King!

	A beat.

				BROWN
		Well, everyone's entitled to their
		opinion.

				BERTIE
		Out of my way!

	Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past.  Suddenly
	BROWN loses it completely.  He grabs the Prince of Wales by
	the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his
	face.

				BROWN
		LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!

	For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he
	has gone too far.  A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face,
	then ...

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

	Weeks later.

	In a roar of hooves and wheels, the Royal Carriage sweeps
	into the huge quadrangle.  JOHN BROWN stands rigid on the
	box, glowering at all the world.

	CAPTION: "WINDSOR"

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass
	of SERVANTS rush in and out, ferrying bags an trunks.

	BROWN marches in, still charged-up from the strain of the
	journey's watchfulness.  He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching
	a break.

				BROWN
		You!  What's your business here?!

				UNDER-PORTER
			(jumping to)
		Under-porter, sir.

				BROWN
		Well, don't stand where you shouldn't!

	The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs.  A few SERVANTS
	exchange looks.  BROWN seems more determined than ever to
	exert his control.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

	That night.

	Carrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks
	towards the stables.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

	The next day.

	BROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the
	grounds.  He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right,
	searching for intruders.  They are being followed at a
	distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback.  VICTORIA frowns
	peevishly.

				VICTORIA
		Must they always follow us?

				BROWN
		I ordered it.  It's for your own
		safety.

				VICTORIA
		Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch
		what I eat next.

	BROWN doesn't react.  A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Am I not safe enough with you, John?

				BROWN
		Aye.
			(looking away)
		But there are Fenians reported on the
		mainland.

				VICTORIA
			(tutting irritably)
		The threat from the Irish is greatly
		exaggerated, I'm sure.

				BROWN
			(snapping back)
		I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

	BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the
	conversation.  A beat.  He pulls up suddenly, staring at
	the shadows in the copse.

				VICTORIA
		Is anything the matter, John?
			(beat)
		John?

	He stares for along moment and then lets it go.

				BROWN
		Nothing's the matter.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

	BROWN marches down the line of horse boxes.  A stable-lad,
	BARNEY, is feeding the horses.  He looks twitchy.

				BROWN
		Hey, Barney.

				BARNEY
		Mr Brown, sir --

				BROWN
		It's cold out there tonight, Barney.

	Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.  The animal
	lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Yeah, there's a good girl.
			(to Barney)
		Have you had a look at this hoof?  She
		was limping badly.  I think there
		might be a stone in it.

				BARNEY
		Yeah, yeah, I did.

				BROWN
		Good man.  And is she all right?

				BARNEY
		Yeah.

				BROWN
		Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? 
		Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you
		know the Queen's riding tomorrow?

				BARNEY
		Yeah.

				BROWN
			(beat)
		Are you all right, Barney?

	BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.  The
	split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Oh, aye...

	The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight.

	As he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a
	fist and fling the others off him.  But the FIRST MAN is up
	again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back. 
	The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly
	strong.  Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them
	fight to force him back.  BARNEY stands transfixed in
	horror.

	Dumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start
	kicking the shit out of him.  BROWN curls into a ball, jaw
	locked, hands over his head.  Not a sound.

	Finally, they back off, panting hard.  The FIRST MAN pulls
	out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces
	whiskey down his throat.  It spills over his face and
	dribbles down his neck.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.

	VICTORIA is standing at the windows.  The door opens and
	LADY ELY walks in.

				VICTORIA
		Well?

				LADY ELY
		Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

				VICTORIA
		Why?

				LADY ELY
		I believe he is unwell, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Unwell?

				LADY ELY
		I understand he was in a fight.

				VICTORIA
		Has he been hurt?

				LADY ELY
		I believe not, ma'am.  I understand --
		he'd had rather too much to drink.

	VICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk.

				VICTORIA
		You may go.

	LADY ELY bows and walks out.  VICTORIA stares at the desk a
	moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work.  She
	cannot.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

	BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his
	undergarments.  His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid
	with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting
	his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending
	to his wounds.

				BROWN
		And she sent no word down?

				ARCHIE
		They said you were drunk.
			(beat)
		Why don't you tell her the truth?

				BROWN
		She'll think it's her fault for
		keeping me.

	ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly
	reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.

				ARCHIE
		What are you doing?!

				BROWN
		I'm getting dressed.

				ARCHIE
		You've got three broken ribs, man!

				BROWN
		I've got my duties to attend to.

				ARCHIE
		Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit
		state to go anywhere.

				BROWN
		She'll be worried about me.

				ARCHIE
		She'll get over it.

				BROWN
		I can't let her down now, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		And when was the last time she put
		herself out for you?  Look, John,
		whatever she says to you now, in the
		end you're still a servant.

				BROWN
		Oh, I'm much more than that.

				ARCHIE
		Aye, she may say that to you, but the
		woman can say what she wants.

				BROWN
		You watch your tongue.

				ARCHIE
		Come on, man, I'm telling you what you
		already know.

				BROWN
		You know nothing about her!

				ARCHIE
		When are you gonna see it, John?  She
		doesn't give a damn about you.

	BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card
	showing a coy picture of a pretty woman.  He holds it up,
	eyes blazing.

				BROWN
		From the Queen!

	He reads out the inscription.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		My lips may give a message better of
		Christmas love than e'en this letter.
			(beat)
		To my best friend, J.B. from his best
		friend, V.R.
			(he thrusts it in his
			 brother's face)
		Best friend!

				ARCHIE
		Aye.

				BROWN
		She means it.

	ARCHIE stares at him.

				ARCHIE
		She'll drop you.  When she's done with
		you, she'll drop you.

				BROWN
		Get out.
			(beat)
		Out!

	ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		OUT!!

	ARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.  VICTORIA sits at her desk.  PONSONBY hands
	her letters to sign.

				PONSONBY
		... to be followed by a visit from
		Lady Bridport.  She is keen to secure
		a place for her niece as Maid of
		Honor.

	VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.

				VICTORIA
		I am tired.

	PONSONBY coughs.

				PONSONBY
		There is one other matter.

				VICTORIA
		What is it?

				PONSONBY
		I have a letter, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		From whom?

				PONSONBY
		From Princess Helena and other members
		of your family.

				VICTORIA
			(stiffening defensively)
		My family is quite capable of
		communicating with the Queen in
		person.

	PONSONBY does not reply.  Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to
	ask.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		What do they want?

				PONSONBY
		They are demanding the dismissal of
		John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

	VICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

	VICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel, nervously
	fingering her handkerchief.  Waiting for her, smiling
	softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		You wished to see me, ma'am?

	She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

	A few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated
	in a corner of the chapel, talking softly.  She cannot
	bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how
	carefully he is watching her throughout the interview. 
	This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles
	to be as honest as possible.

				VICTORIA
		My husband tried always to make me
		think more subtly.  Of course he
		taught me so much and I can never
		repay my debt to him, or the love I
		feel, even now.  But, in truth, I
		think I am someone who can only feel
		things while they are alive to me. 
		For that reason, I know I do not have
		a subtle mind.  I know that.  But I
		work hard and I try to do my duty.
			(she hesitates; she is
			 struggling now)
		However, I have noticed of late that
		my feelings of grief are not so strong
		and -- that I find myself leaning more
		upon the comfort of living friends.
			(beat)
		Friends close to me now.

	She stops herself.  She is crying.  DEAN WELLSELLY watches
	her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words
	carefully.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Your Majesty, a settled resignation is
		more lasting proof of affection than
		active grief.  If the good Lord sees
		fit to bring one into contact with
		congenial fellow beings, one should
		not analyze one's reaction too deeply. 
		To allow oneself to be comforted by
		someone else need not imply any
		disloyalty to the memory of the loved
		one.

	Silence.  VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel. 
	Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her
	disappointment turns to anger.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day, VICTORIA stands at the far window and her
	back to the room.  Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and
	his siblings.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry.

	PONSONBY steps forward.

				PONSONBY
		Ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Please tell the Princess, and other
		signatories to this letter, that the
		Queen will not be dictated to, or made
		to alter, in any way, what she has
		found to answer for her comfort.
			(beat)
		Do I make myself clear?

				PONSONBY
		Ma'am.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA
		You may go.

	They all file out.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

	A few days later.

	BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback.  Although
	better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised. 
	They turn a corner banked by trees.  BROWN is watching the
	QUEEN closely.  She stops.

				VICTORIA
		I would like to get down.

	Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her
	horse.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		John?

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		I was told you were in a fight.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Has someone seen to those bruises?

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

	A beat.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Yes?

				BROWN
		Having considered my position here at
		court, I have come to the conclusion
		that it is in the best interest of
		Your Majesty that I should resign.

				VICTORIA
		I do not accept.

	A beat.

				BROWN
		I had foreseen that you would not. 
		But Your Majesty should understand --
		that my mind will not be changed in
		this.  I leave for Deeside --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in)
		The Queen forbids it.
			(beat)
		I cannot allow it because I cannot
		live without you.  Without you, I
		cannot find the strength to be who I
		must be.  Please.

	She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then
	looks at him, utterly helpless.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Promise me you won't let them send me
		back.

	A long silence.  BROWN holds her hand tight.

				BROWN
		I promise.

	Reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors
	bang behind him.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.

	QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with
	great vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish
	ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,
	almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE
	LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand
	in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. 
	Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a
	quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.

	DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards
	off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician
	to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This
	man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his
	smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she
	belts, until her children are drowned out completely.

	And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops
	playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The
	HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,
	but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.

				VICTORIA
		How dare the Irish break with the
		Anglicans? 
		If Albert were alive today he would
		never allow the Crown to give up
		Church patronage.  No, the Irish must
		be told, very firmly, to stay exactly
		where they are.  It is the thin edge
		of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.  Next, you
		will be telling me that the Crown no
		longer governs this nation.

	A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.

				DISRAELI
		Your Majesty remains at the very
		epicenter of governance.  As for your
		people, look no further than the sales
		of your Highland Journals to see in
		what affection the nation holds their
		Queen.
			(beat)
		You sell even more copies than Mr
		Dickens.

				VICTORIA
		But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.

	VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.  DISRAELI acknowledges it,
	then steers the conversation back.

				DISRAELI
		Of course I understand your concern. 
		You miss your people.
			(a pause)
		And they miss you.

	VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the
	implied criticism.

				VICTORIA
		Then they may read about me.

				DISRAELI
		Indeed, and for that they are
		eternally grateful.

				VICTORIA
		Is that not enough?

				DISRAELI
		In so many ways ... and yet it is your
		presence they crave.  A figurehead.

	VICTORIA has the measure of him.

				VICTORIA
		I never thought to be bullied by you,
		Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought,
		understood a widow's grief.

				DISRAELI
		Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for
		the nation, only for myself.  As Prime
		Minister I confess I miss your
		presence, but that is only an
		expression of my own selfish desires
		and I should not burden you with it.

	The Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA
	acknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks
	directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.

				VICTORIA
		I stay here because I am happy.
			(beat)
		Is that such a terrible crime?

				DISRAELI
		No, ma'am.

	At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.

				BROWN
		Time for your walk.

	Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts
	following him out.  As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.

				VICTORIA
		This is my good John Brown.

				DISRAELI
			(taking him in)
		Yes.

				VICTORIA
		I have asked him to show you a little
		of Highland life while you are with us
		at Balmoral.

	BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.

				BROWN
		What brings you here?

				DISRAELI
		A man can refuse only so many
		invitations from his Queen.  It was
		remiss of me not to come earlier.

	VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN stares.

				BROWN
		What do you know about the Highlands?

				DISRAELI
		I am a blank sheet.

				BROWN
		Do you hunt?

				DISRAELI
		Occasionally.

				BROWN
		Dare say you can be taught.

				DISRAELI
		To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

				BROWN
		If you hunt, you kill.

	DISRAELI counters effortlessly.

				DISRAELI
		Well then, I'll do my best.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of
	shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against
	heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud,
	crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly
	cold.

	Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. 
	The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way up
	the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and
	dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then
	the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front.

	Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up
	the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men
	on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other
	GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them
	ARCHIE.

	Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts.

	He listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his
	quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen
	dismount as quietly as they can.

	As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his
	side.  He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and
	drinks.  All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	The stalking.

	Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to
	each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill.

	DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes
	on his man, trying to make no sound.

	Suddenly, BROWN stops.  Very slowly he rises.  DISRAELI
	rides alongside and sees ...

	A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside.

	Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his
	rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.  With a
	deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines.  BROWN
	stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his
	shoulder and fires.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	The kill.

	A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ...

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his
	side.

				BROWN
			(demonstrating with his
			 rifle)
		Always remember, you keep it tight to
		your shoulder, you absorb the kick. 
		Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's
		Gladstone.

				DISRAELI
			(smiling)
		Quite.

	BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who
	declines.  He watches BROWN take a long swig.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	That night.

	BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.  He has
	a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list. 
	Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh,
	are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty
	ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIE'S VALET.  They each step up,
	one at a time, to make their report.

				BROWN
			(ticking as he goes)
		... Back doors, West Wing.

				UPPER SERVANT 1
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Side doors, East Wing.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Louder, girl!

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
			(creasing up)
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Kitchen and lower house.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Back and upper corridors.

				UPPER SERVANT 2
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Front door.
			(beat)
		Checked and locked.

	Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and
	sits.  On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid
	a clatter of cutlery and chat.

	ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched
	over his plate, pecking at his food.

	Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up.  BERTIE'S VALET
	coughs.  BROWN slowly lifts his head.  His eyes have the
	slightly unfocused look of too much drink.  It is clear to
	ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.

				BERTIE'S VALET
			(with a smug smile)
		Did you see any Irish assassins today,
		Mr Brown?

	Brown doesn't react.

				BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
		We heard the dogs were Fenian
		sympathizers.

	Brown drinks.

				BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
		Or was it the stag ...?

	Everyone bursts out laughing.  Brown slams down his glass.

				BROWN
		There's not a soul here cares about
		that wee woman's safety except me! 
		She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there
		to look out for her --

	He stops.  ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair
	and pulls gently on his arm.

	BROWN stares at the SERVANTS.  Everyone is about to burst
	out laughing.  Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his
	chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away.

	As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in
	the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	BROWN is lying on a grubby bed.  ARCHIE is looking around
	the untidy room.  For the first time, he notices a thick
	manuscript on the table.  BROWN follows his eyes.

				ARCHIE
		What's this?

				BROWN
		It's a diary.

				ARCHIE
		Be careful who sees it.

				BROWN
		What do you take me for?

	ARCHIE turns back to BROWN.

				ARCHIE
		You should have someone look after
		you.

				BROWN
		I'm all right.  I just need to rest up
		a wee bit.
			(feeling everything spin)
		The room ... You don't have to stay.

	BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift.  ARCHIE watches
	over him.

				ARCHIE
		The place is a mess.

				BROWN
		I can't move to tidy.

				ARCHIE
		It's what the maids are for.

				BROWN
		I'm not having some prattler going
		through my things.

	A beat.

				ARCHIE
		Won't you give yourself a rest, John? 
		She's other people to look out for
		her.

				BROWN
		She needs me, Archie.  She canna do
		without me, she said it to my face.
			(his hands come up to cover
			 his eyes)
		How can I stop now?

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY

	Dawn the next morning.

	BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the
	stairs.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --
	to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up
	in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket.

				BROWN
		You sent for me.

				DISRAELI
		I've been called back to London.  My
		last day.  I thought I might take a
		walk on Lochnagar.

	BROWN stares straight back.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	An hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill.  BROWN has
	his head down, on with the job.  DISRAELI slows to a halt.

				DISRAELI
		Princes and Lords are but the breath
		of kings, An honest man's the noblest
		work of God.
			(beat)
		You must miss such magnificent views.

				BROWN
		I don't think about it.

	They reach the top and continue along the high ground. 
	DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp.

				DISRAELI
		Forgive me, I've called you out and
		you should have been resting.

				BROWN
		I'm fine.

				DISRAELI
		You're injured.

				BROWN
		It's nothing.

				DISRAELI
		Still, someone must attend you.  Your
		wife should not have let you out.

				BROWN
		I'm not married.

				DISRAELI
			(deadpan)
		Oh.

				BROWN
		This is the top.

	DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.

				DISRAELI
		I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am
		not married myself, I see my wife so
		little.  But I'm forgetting the
		rewards.

	He looks across.  BROWN keeps staring ahead.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		The look on their faces when one walks
		into the room.  Still gives one a
		ridiculous thrill.

				BROWN
		I wouldn't know.

				DISRAELI
		Surely --

				BROWN
			(interrupts)
		What I do, I do for my Queen.

				DISRAELI
		Was there never ambition?

				BROWN
			(beat)
		Maybe, once.

				DISRAELI
		Then I envy yo.

				BROWN
		Why?

				DISRAELI
		To have achieved one's ambition, or to
		have reconciled oneself to its limits,
		is a lifetime's work.

				BROWN
		I do what I do.

				DISRAELI
		For Her Majesty.

				BROWN
		Aye.

				DISRAELI
		But yourself?
			(beat)
		What about John Brown?

				BROWN
		I said.
			(beat)
		I serve the Queen.

				DISRAELI
		No other aspiration?

	BROWN stares for a long moment.  Finally he speaks.

				BROWN
		To see her safe.

	DISRAELI steps a little closer.

				DISRAELI
		You will not be unaware of the threat
		now posed by Republicanism.

				BROWN
		Why do you think I keep her here?

				DISRAELI
		Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It
		is her very isolation that encourages
		the malcontents.  The longer she is
		away, the stronger they become; and
		who, honestly, can promise security
		against that?  However many doors you
		lock, someone will always get in. 
		Even here.

	BROWN watches him, eyes alert.

				BROWN
		So...?

				DISRAELI
		The truth is, the Queen would be safer
		doing her duty and returning south to
		her public.  John Bull loves her and
		John Bull is her best defense.

				BROWN
		Her mind is set.  She won't change
		now.

				DISRAELI
		She trusts you, John.

	DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.

				BROWN
		They don't see it.

				DISRAELI
		See what?

				BROWN
		The threat.
			(beat)
		I tell them, but they don't see it.

				DISRAELI
		They aren't as watchful as you.

				BROWN
		Too busy looking after themselves.

				DISRAELI
		The greasy pole.

				BROWN
		No loyalty.

				DISRAELI
		No love.

	Silence.  For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone
	else has said that.

				BROWN
		I promised to protect her from people
		like you.

				DISRAELI
		For once in my life, I am not the
		issue.

				BROWN
		She'll never understand it.

				DISRAELI
		In time, she will.

				BROWN
		She'll think I betrayed her.

				DISRAELI
		But others will know that you acted
		for the greater good.

	BROWN stares off into the distance.

	EXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY

	The next day.

	BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES
	wait on the shore.

	VICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the
	surface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them
	carefully through the water.  

				VICTORIA
		I received a letter today from Mr
		Disraeli.  Parliament is calling for
		my return to public duties.
			(beat)
		Why won't they let us be?

	BROWN does not answer.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		He insists that the country expects me
		to preside over the opening of the new
		session.  I refuse to offer sustenance
		to enable his weakening grip. 
		Besides, you know how much I should
		hate it.  It frightens me.

	She notices that BROWN has said nothing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		John?

	BROWN does not look at her.  Finally:

				BROWN
		We can't always have what we wish.

	VICTORIA stares at him.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Later that day.

	VICTORIA and BROWN are in the middle of a blazing row in
	front of the entire Household, including PONSONBY, JENNER
	and LADY ELY.

				VICTORIA
		Duty?!  You talk about duty?!

				BROWN
		If duty and safety are served by the
		same end then, aye, I do.

				VICTORIA
		I cannot believe you are saying this? 
		You, who I have relied on all this
		time --

				BROWN
			(cutting in)
		Have I ever let you down before--?

				VICTORIA
			(as if he had not spoken)
		-- You stand there and tell me it is
		my duty ... after all you promised me!

				BROWN
		I'm breaking no promises!

				VICTORIA
		You are forcing me to do the very
		thing you know I fear most!

				BROWN
		For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying
		to keep you safe!

				VICTORIA
		I will not hear any more about my
		safety!!  You made me a promise and
		now you have broken it!

	BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.

				BROWN
		-- When I took you out riding, come
		rain or shine, because I knew it was
		right for you, when I kept the bairns
		off your back so you could have a bit
		of peace, when I saw you safe from
		home to home and you didn't even know
		I was there...!  All I've ever thought
		about is you!

				VICTORIA
		Then why send me back to them?!

				BROWN
		Because I have to!
			(pause
		Will you no listen to me, woman?

	Face turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.

				VICTORIA
		Do not presume to talk to your Queen
		in that manner.

	A long silence.  BROWN watches her, but she will not look
	at him again.  Finally, she walks very slowly across the
	room.  She turns in the doorway, her voice faltering
	slightly.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell.  I shall
		retire to my chamber.  Please attend
		me presently.

	As the door slams, we ...

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "NOVEMBER"

						FADE IN:

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, DINING ROOM - DAY

	A few weeks later.

	Close on a door as it opens.  The ROYAL FAMILY are eating
	lunch with members of the UPPER HOUSEHOLD.  VICTORIA walks
	in with LADY ELY.

	A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks
	and stands.  Clearly, they were not expecting her.  In
	silence, VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head
	of the table.

	At last, PONSONBY leans forward deferentially.

				PONSONBY
		May I say, how glad I am to see Your
		Majesty so much recovered.

	VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. 
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. 
	VICTORIA frowns.

				VICTORIA
		Where is my son?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Why is he not here?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		He is sick, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Then why are you not with him?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		You ordered all members of the Royal
		Family to attend you at Balmoral.

				VICTORIA
		What is the matter with him?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

	VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.

				VICTORIA
		No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert,
		my husband, had typhoid fever.  I
		asked what was wrong with my son.

				JENNER
		The same, your Majesty.

	VICTORIA stops.  She stares down the length of the table. 
	A long pause.

				VICTORIA
		Why was I not informed?

				JENNER
		I did not consider it wise, in the
		circumstances, to tax your nerves.

				VICTORIA
		How ill is he?

	No answer.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
			(to Alexandra)
		Alex?

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		He is not well, ma'am.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I must go to him.

	Suddenly, VICTORIA stands.  Chairs bang back as everyone
	leaps to their feet.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		We must leave at once.

	Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts
	into activity.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the
	servants and Householders hurrying about in every
	direction.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage
	amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders
	rushing to be ready in time.

	Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles
	out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time 
	- yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and
	take her place.  She ignores him completely.

	BROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother
	ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a
	second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's
	obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. 
	BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races
	away under him.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	Some days later.  A tableau.

	QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch
	surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY.  They watch DOCTOR JENNER
	bend to examine the ghostly figure of BERTIE.  He listens
	for a pulse.  Finally, he looks up.

				JENNER
		Better.

	VICTORIA lets out a deep breath.  She takes hold of
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.

				VICTORIA
		Should the good Lord see fit to spare
		my son, I will order a mass to be
		celebrated at St. George's.  The
		people must share with their Queen,
		her prayers and hopes for their future
		King.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the
	door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him
	with PONSONBY at her side.

				PONSONBY
			(aside to BROWN)
		The Queen will be riding to St.
		George's on the fifth.

				BROWN
			(launching straight in)
		I recommend Her Majesty uses the
		covered carriage with a full Horse
		Guard.  In the event of any
		disturbance I will ensure --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in)
		I will ride to St. George's in an open
		carriage.  It is time the Queen was
		seen by her public.

	VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed
	by PONSONBY.  We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and
	closer until ...

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

	Some weeks later.

	A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of
	onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding
	the cathedral.  All the time, his eyes flick left and
	right, searching the faces in front of him for potential
	assassins.  Over his intense watchfulness we hear ...

				DEAN WELLSELLY (O.S.)
		... praise and magnify thy glorious
		name for that thou has raised thy
		servant Albert Edward, Prince of Wales
		from the bed of sickness. 
		We pray thee to perfect the recovery
		of thy servant and to crown him day by
		day with more abundant blessings both
		for body and soul, through Jesus
		Christ our Lord ...

	The CONGREGATION mutters a vast ...

				CONGREGATION (O.S.)
		Amen.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

	VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down
	the steps towards the cheering crowd.  As DEAN WELLSELLY
	and BROWN follow, BROWN sees ARTHUR O'CONNER break from the
	onlookers, pulling out a gun.  BROWN yells out:

				BROWN
		NO!!

	He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to
	the ground and twists the gun out of his hand.  As they
	fall we hear laughter and:

				BERTIE (O.S.)
		So there he is, Arthur O'Conner...

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, DINING HALL - NIGHT

	It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private
	dinner party.  They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY.  BROWN is in
	attendance.  He stands off to one side, near the door.

				BERTIE
			(bristling with confidence)
		... all seven stone of the man,
		paddling madly towards us through a
		sea of Horse Guards, waving something
		that looks vaguely like a pen.  I
		thought he must be one of the mother's
		ardent readership in search of the
		Royal indenture...

	More chortling.  VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly. 
	BROWN looks straight ahead.

				BERTIE (CONT'D)
		I believe I saw him first and then
		alerted Brown.  I'm not convinced that
		he wasn't taking a snooze on top of
		the box.  Anyway, we had our man
		pinned down and I must say, Brown
		acquitted himself admirably.  Of
		course the gun was a fake, but all the
		same, it was well done.

	No-one registers BROWN.  But while VICTORIA does not look
	at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.

				VICTORIA
		I intend Brown to be rewarded with a
		special medal cast in gold.  It will
		be called The Devoted Service Medal.

	The guests applaud politely.  BERTIE clinks his glass for
	attention and raises it high.

				BERTIE
		A toast.  Victoria Regina!

	The others raise their glasses in unison.

				EVERYONE
		Victoria Regina!

	VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN remains alone by the door.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		The people of England have expressed
		in a manner which cannot be mistaken,
		that they will uphold the ancient
		monarchy of England ...

	INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

	DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of
	Tory delegates.

				DISRAELI
		... If the first great object of the
		Tory Party is to maintain the
		institutions of the country, the
		second is, in my opinion, to maintain
		the Empire of England ... the

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1883"

						FADE IN:

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The sound of rain driven hard against a window.  We creep
	slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty
	year-old BROWN.  With his whiskey for company, he is
	sitting at his desk, writing in the diary.

	The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but
	there remain a few blank pages.  Slowly, he fills them in.

				BROWN (V.O.)
		We should not live in expectation of
		contentment.  Fifteen years of
		vigilance will not guarantee peace of
		mind.  Yesterday, intruders were again
		reported in the South Wing.  I believe
		my prompt arrival may have averted any
		crisis, but it was a timely reminder. 
		It is a great comfort to me that my
		efforts in securing the Queen's safety
		over the years have not been in vain. 
		Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word
		that she's dissatisfied.  And I feel
		sure that if she were unhappy she
		would have found the occasion  to
		speak to me in person, as she has so
		often done in the past.

	A knock at the door.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		What is it?

	We hear a young PAGE, breathless from running.

				PAGE
		North woods, sir.

	BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

	BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm.  He
	walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his
	hair and clothes.

	Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm.

	A coin flips through the air to be caught by an
	outstretched hand.  The second GUARD grins.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT

	BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	And now we are back with the opening sequence.  Truncated,
	severe, and shot from a slightly different angle.  The
	driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack
	to his left, he spins and plunges on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for
	air.  He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
	length.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.

	Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly
	swaying trees.  A branch snaps behind him.  He spins round,
	bellows deep from his heart:

				BROWN
		God save the Queen!!

	And fires.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A few days later.

	VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY
	ELY.  They arrive at a door.  VICTORIA stands facing it.

				VICTORIA
			(quietly)
		How long has he been this sick?

				LADY ELY
		A few days, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Why was I not told earlier?

	LADY ELY doesn't answer.  VICTORIA knows anyway.  She nods. 
	LADY ELY knocks.  The door is opened by a young UNDER
	SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here
	in the servant's quarters.  VICTORIA walks in.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of
	the life here shocks her deeply.  The cheap furniture, the
	anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.

	He is lying in bed, barely conscious.  After a moment, he
	opens his eyes and stares at her.  She steps forward,
	smiling nervously.

	Her voice is the old voice, between friends.

				VICTORIA
		You should never have gone out in such
		foul weather.

				BROWN
		Someone has to look after you.
			(pause)
		It could've been someone.  It was
		before.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.  Yes it was.

	He cannot speak.  It's difficult for her too, but she
	speaks for him.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		My Ministers are as impertinent as
		ever.  Dispatches are now so numerous,
		they come in a trunk.  Sometimes I do
		believe they will never stop.  Endless
		letters...
		 

	Her voice falters.  A pause

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I know I have not always been the
		loyal friend you deserved, John.  And
		yet here I am now, even now, feeling
		desperate at the thought of losing
		you.

	She starts to cry.

				BROWN
		Don't be silly, woman.

	His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
	herself together.  Seeing a bowl of water on the side
	table, she steps across.  Carefully folding a cloth in
	four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. 
	Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN
	gestures protectively.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Not too near.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	A week later.  PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window
	overlooking the grounds.

				JENNER
		Erysipelas.

				PONSONBY
		Not too protracted, I hope.

				JENNER
			(shakes his head)
		A few days...
			(beat)
		When he heard, the Prince of Wales
		threw the bust from the window of the
		Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to
		gather the fragments.

	A beat.

				PONSONBY
		The Queen wishes to publish an account
		of him.

				JENNER
		Dear oh dear.

				PONSONBY
		We think she can be dissuaded.
			(beat)
		Have you had a glance at the diary?

				JENNER
		Yes.

				PONSONBY
		Quite.
			(beat)
		I think I'd best take it back.

				JENNER
		Of course.

	He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it
	over to PONSONBY.  The two men move away from the window,
	to go their separate ways.  Daily business beckons.

				JENNER (CONT'D)
		Where did you find it by the way?

				PONSONBY
		Some young page was boasting about
		having seen it.
			(beat)
		Lucky.

	JENNER nods.

				JENNER
		Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.

				PONSONBY
		No, indeed.

	The two men head off in opposite directions down the
	corridor.
MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Begin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. 
	Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
	a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN
	BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and
	right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his
	left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past
	saplings and plunges on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
	air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,
	bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. 
	Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he
	hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and
	races on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
	length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now
	there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps
	fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes
	forward, never stumbling once.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and
	stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow
	circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
	wildly swaying trees.

	There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins
	round, bellows deep from his heart:

				BROWN
		God save the Queen!!

	And fires.

	Nothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes
	on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into
	empty space.  A pause.

	Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
	him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,
	waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol
	drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. 
	And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have
	fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He
	shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He
	goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. 
	Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher
	and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1864"

						FADE IN:

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from
		Balmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned
		him, on one or two occasions, as being
		a most devoted outdoor servant to
		Prince Albert during his last days
		there...

	John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.

						 CUT TO:

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	The screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover
	that we are looking at a black night-gown.

	Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an
	elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... The depths of the Queen's sorrow
		remain impenetrable.  She has now
		restricted herself to a regime of such
		ferocious introspection that we are
		all at our wits' end...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk
	is laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his
	suits before laying it carefully on the bed.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... The Household continues, at her
		instruction, to observe the rituals
		now so familiar to her, in a vain
		attempt to render vivid that which can
		never be revived...

	Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed
	carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	The hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the
	widow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is
	set in a mask of severity.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... It will not surprise you to hear
		that she continues steadfast in her
		refusal to accept any public
		engagements, however trivial...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal
	bed.  His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.

	A somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:
	DOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician.  He is placing
	potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.

	Behind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and
	remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
	room.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... Family and staff expend all their
		efforts endeavouring to draw her out
		of this state of unfettered morbidity,
		but to no avail.  Indeed, Doctor
		Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
		her sanity, unless some remedy is
		found...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	VICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT
	DRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... We must hope, therefore, that this
		Mr Brown will appeal to the Queen's
		sentimental, though deeply-held, view
		that all Highlanders are good for the
		health.  If she can at least be
		persuaded to take the air, the
		prospect of further recovery may seem
		less remote...

	The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress. 
	VICTORIA winces slightly.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
			(terrified)
		Sorry, ma'am.

	EXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:
	"ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864."

	A DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart
	bearing the Royal coat of arms.

	John BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the
	waiting driver.  He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome
	and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... He is arriving by boat this
		afternoon, by which time it is hoped
		Her Majesty will be in a fit state to
		consider riding out...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY

	SIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is
	sitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... As to that decision, along with
		all others, we remain, as ever,
		prisoners of the Queen's grief.
			(beat)
		Ever your devoted husband, Henry.

	He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope.  He is a
	middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine
	and with a civil servant's stoop.  As he looks up, we see a
	white-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door. 
	PONSONBY hands the letter to him.

				PONSONBY (CONT'D)
		Windsor.

						 CUT TO:

	CAPTION: "OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT"

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	A series of windows are being slammed open by white
	stockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER
	HOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and
	rushing to make the luncheon hour.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Queen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two
	ladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying
	along a pace behind.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into
	the icy dining room and take their designated places at the
	luncheon table.  Everybody is dressed in mourning and
	nobody speaks.  Wind whistles through the open windows. 
	Silence.

	Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the
	Prince of Wales.  He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff
	dressed and balding.  He stands next to his young wife,
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,
	trying to keep warm.

	As BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER
	bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to
	PONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
	with the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.

				JENNER
		Congratulations, Your Royal Highness!

				BERTIE
		Thank you, Doctor.

				JENNER
		A boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent.

				BERTIE
		Yes.
			(beat)
		Albert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What
		do you think?

				PONSONBY
		A fine choice, sir.

				JENNER
		Excellent!

	EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the
	carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans
	in.

				DRIVER
		Are you riding up front?

	BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.

				BROWN
		I'll stay with the pony, thank you. 
		She's all the way from Deeside and
		she's not sure she likes you yet.

	The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
	breath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.

				VICTORIA
		How many?

	LADY ELY is slightly taken aback.

				LADY ELY
		The Royal Family and senior members of
		the household, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Just them?

				LADY ELY
		Yes, ma'am.

	VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps
	through the door.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the
	other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.

	She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else
	sits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by
	waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.

	It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA
	starts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the
	same.

	Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on
	down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns
	stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne
	House.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress
	curiously.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain
	pudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and
	whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
	finished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the
	routine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.

				JENNER
		We're expecting Brown this afternoon,
		ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Whom?

	A beat.  VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with
	her napkin and rises.  Everyone else rises too.  Suddenly,
	the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		That's a very pretty shawl you are
		wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.
			(beat)
		But you are not eating enough.  One
		must not let vanity overrule one's
		appetite.

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		Yes, ma'am.

	VICTORIA nods earnestly.  Lost to the effect her words have
	had, she marches out again.  Behind her, she leaves
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
	front of all the others.  BERTIE takes her hand and
	squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

	The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance
	and the DRIVER opens the doors.

	JOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
	the time.  His eyes narrow critically.

				BROWN
		I was due at a quarter past one.
			(beat)
		You're late.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	A few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long
	corridor with PONSONBY at his side.  Their journey takes
	them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and
	householders hurrying about their duties.  The presence of
	the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed
	portraits and busts that crop up along the way.

	BROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.

				PONSONBY
			(in low tones)
		Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House
		is not as you will remember it.  The
		Household remains in full mourning and
		no-one is permitted to raise their
		voice under any circumstances
		whatsoever.  As for the Queen's
		routine, she breakfasts at nine
		thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at
		five thirty and dinner at eight forty
		five.  No one is allowed to leave the
		building while the Queen is at home. 
		On the rare occasions when she is out,
		you may ask permission to leave, but
		only with my consent. 
		You're to be ready to walk the pony at
		any time after ten o'clock.  You'll
		clean her outdoor things and do any
		odd jobs as and when she requires.

				BROWN
		How will I know?

				PONSONBY
			(surprised to be interrupted)
		I'm sorry?

				BROWN
		How will I know what she requires?

				PONSONBY
		You'll be sent a message.

				BROWN
		Who'll bring it to me?

				PONSONBY
		Her Highness' Equerry.

				BROWN
		I need a man who knows where I am.

				PONSONBY
		I'm sure it won't be difficult to find
		you.

				BROWN
		That's not good enough.

	A beat.

				PONSONBY
		Then we'll have to see what can be
		arranged.

				BROWN
		Aye, do.

	PONSONBY stiffens.  A beat.

				PONSONBY
		There is to be no communication with
		other members of the household on
		matters concerning the court except
		through myself or one of the
		Equerries.  No plans must be altered
		unless you are given prior authority
		by myself or a senior member of the
		household.

				BROWN
		I came down at the Queen's request. 
		I'll take my orders from her.

				PONSONBY
		In matters concerning the Household, I
		act on her behalf.

	BROWN takes the measure of him.

				BROWN
		Do you?

				PONSONBY
		Yes.
			(beat)
		I do.

	BROWN glances up the corridor.

				BROWN
		So, is passing wind out of the
		question or do I need permission for
		that?

	PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They
	reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the
	interview.

				PONSONBY
		As I am sure you remember from
		Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her
		Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty
		addresses you directly.

	BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a
	moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY
	waits by the door.

				PONSONBY (O.S.)
		Mr Brown, ma'am.

	VICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her
	numerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter,
	underlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY
	ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. 
	She carries on working.

	BROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything
	are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince
	Albert glimpsed in the corridor.

	Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. 
	He steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks
	up and BROWN bows deeply.

	Silence.

	She stares at him for a long moment without apparently
	registering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright
	tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black
	and knotted with tension.

	Finally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Brown.

				BROWN
		Ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You are here safely.

				BROWN
		Aye, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You are well?

				BROWN
		I am.

				VICTORIA
		And the pony?

				BROWN
		She's well, too.

	VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is
	bringing him back.  A beat.

				VICTORIA
		Your family sent cards.  It was much
		appreciated.

				BROWN
		I'm glad of it.

	In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds
	the same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike
	others, seems unaffected.

				VICTORIA
		My husband was always very
		complimentary in speaking of you.  He
		would have approved, I am sure, of my
		calling on you in this way.
			(beat)
		I trust it does not inconvenience you
		too much.

				BROWN
		I've no family, ma'am, apart from my
		brothers and sisters.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.
			(beat)
		You have a brother in service here, do
		you not?
			(furrowing her brow)
		I forget his name.

				BROWN
		Archie.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.
			(beat)
		That will be company for you.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

	Silence.  VICTORIA starts to tire.  She takes a sip of
	water and spills a little on herself.  Flustered, she
	searches for a hanky but cannot find one.  LADY ELY hurries
	up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.  BROWN
	watches all of this with genuine concern.  When VICTORIA
	finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Honest to God, I never thought to see
		you in such a state.  You must miss
		him dreadfully.

	VICTORIA stares back in stunned silence.  PONSONBY coughs
	involuntarily.  LADY ELY freezes.  A beat.

				VICTORIA
		You do not - he ... get him out.
			(beat)
		Get him out.  Get him out!

	Suddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the
	room.  LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts
	herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Some minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk. 
	His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
	ferocity with which he slams down every object.

	His younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed.  He's in his
	early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same
	distinctive kilt and tweed.

				ARCHIE
			(telling it fast)
		So the day they arrive, she greets the
		Sultan and his family with barely a
		word and then retires to her chamber. 
		The Sultan, not used to State
		Occasions without a head of State, is
		standing in the lobby waiting for
		someone to tell him what to do.  But
		the court is under strict instructions
		not to talk in the corridors so nobody
		speaks to him, not a living soul, for
		the whole afternoon.  So now it's
		dinner and everyone's standing round
		the table -- still not a word --
		waiting for Her Majesty to arrive. 
		One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's
		getting a wee bit peckish to say the
		least.  So finally, his wee laddy
		breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
		slice in his mouth.  Well, the uproar
		when she heard.  You'd have thought
		someone had stolen the crown jewels.

	BROWN stares back, still pissed off.

				BROWN
		So?

				ARCHIE
		So, there are rules.  Things you do
		and things you don't do.

				BROWN
		I was just telling the woman how I
		feel, for God's sake.

				ARCHIE
		You don't tell Her Majesty how you
		feel.

				BROWN
		I speak as I find, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		Not down south you don't.

	BROWN slams a drawer shut.  ARCHIE lets it go and watches
	his brother.  A beat.

				ARCHIE (CONT'D)
		So what did Ponsonby do when she
		started shouting?

				BROWN
		I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

	A beat, then both men burst out laughing.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY

	The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
	hurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper
	Servant's huge table for dinner.  ARCHIE leads BROWN
	through this rush of activity.

				BROWN
		How much?

				ARCHIE
		Seventy a year.

				BROWN
		Not bad, not bad.

				ARCHIE
		How about yourself?

				BROWN
		Sixty.

				ARCHIE
			(grinning)
		That's pretty good for a ghillie.

	BROWN smiles dryly.  They pour themselves a drink from the
	table.

				BROWN
		Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who
		bleeds all day?  So what does his
		valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?

				ARCHIE
		It's better than shovelling horse
		shit.

				BROWN
		If you were looking for promotion, you
		should have picked one of the
		healthier ones.

				ARCHIE
		She's hardly a full hamper herself.

				BROWN
			(beat)
		It's only grief makes her like she is.

				ARCHIE
		Three years, John.  Is that not a bit
		long to be grieving?

				BROWN
		She loved him.

				ARCHIE
		Come on, man.  There's love and
		there's ...

				BROWN
		What?

				ARCHIE
		You know what I mean.

				BROWN
		I'm not sure I do, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		There's love and there's behaving like
		you do because there's nobody to tell
		you not to.

	Hold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the
	hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.

				BROWN
		Which one of us is she flirting with?

				ARCHIE
		The good-looking one.

				BROWN
		Aye?  Then she's obviously not got
		enough to do.

				ARCHIE
		You work the system right, you could
		ask her yourself.  Just be thankful
		you're not working for Household.  The
		Queen never lets them out of her
		sight.  But wee spats like us can slip
		through the net, easy.

	A beat.  BROWN stares straight at him.

				BROWN
		I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

	The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a
	corridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA
	suddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her
	entourage are several steps past her before they realize
	what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions
	behind.

	Now we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is
	standing in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches
	him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Some hours later.  It is now raining.

	A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage
	from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES
	frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John
	BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
	around him, laughing and giggling.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING

	Rain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite
	direction down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops
	at the same place as before.

				VICTORIA
			(as if she had not seem him
			 earlier)
		Who is that?

	Lady Ely peers through the rain.

				LADY ELY
		It's Mr Brown, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		What is he doing there?

				LADY ELY
		He appears to be ... standing by his
		horse.

				VICTORIA
		I made no request to go out riding
		today.
			(beat)
		How long has he been there?

				LADY ELY
		I don't know, ma'am.
			(nervously)
		He was observed earlier, I believe.

	At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the
		courtyard.  I have no wish to go
		riding.

				PONSONBY
		I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't
		imagine -- he was certainly given no
		instructions.

				VICTORIA
		Please make sure it does not happen
		again.

				PONSONBY
		Of course, at once.

	VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

	Half an hour later, PONSONBY stands at his desk facing
	BROWN.

				PONSONBY
		What on earth did you think you were
		doing?

	BROWN stares straight back.

				BROWN
		Awaiting my orders.

				PONSONBY
		You do not report for duty unless the
		Queen requests it.  You know that very
		well.

				BROWN
		I didn't come all this way to sit on
		my arse.

				PONSONBY
		You will await your orders like
		everyone else.  Unless you prefer a
		repeat of yesterday's little
		excitement.

				BROWN
		No.

				PONSONBY
		I beg your pardon?

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY

	The next day.  From a high window, we see PONSONBY
	scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
	JOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day
	before.

	VICTORIA watches impassively.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY

	PONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.

				PONSONBY
		I thought I made myself perfectly
		clear.  You do not leave your room
		until Her Majesty requests it.

				BROWN
			(eyes straight ahead,
			 shouting back)
		Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if
		her husband was here now, he'd have
		had her out of that house and getting
		some air in her.  What the hell's the
		point in me being here otherwise?!

	From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words.  A
	beat.  PONSONBY collects himself.

				PONSONBY
		Go inside at once.

				BROWN
		Is that the Queen's request?

				PONSONBY
		Yes, it most certainly is!

	BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back
	to the stables.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, STABLES - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling
	his horse.  Suddenly he turns.

	VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her
	entourage.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Brown.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You have been told repeatedly not to
		stand in the courtyard unless
		requested to do so.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Then why do you persist in doing it?

				BROWN
		Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. 
		If ever there was a poor soul who
		needed fresh air, it is her.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA
		The Queen will ride out if and when
		she chooses.

				BROWN
		And I intend to be there when she's
		ready.

	Silence.  The two of them stare at each other.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured
	landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the
	distance, the glittering sea.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in
	silence.

	EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY

	VICTORIA looks up.

				VICTORIA
		Prince Albert was going to build a
		bench here.  He thought it one of the
		best views in Osborne.

				BROWN
		It's a fine spot, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		He thought so, yes.

	She stares ahead.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		In everything I do and everything I
		say, I try to think, as much as
		possible, what he would do, or say, if
		he were here now.  My Private
		Secretary wishes me to return to
		public duties--

	She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.

				BROWN
		If Prince Albert were here today, he'd
		tell him a thing or two.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish
		it.
			(beat)
		The same people who refused to grant
		my husband the title of King because
		he was deemed of insufficient rank--

	She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		It is a fine spot for a bench, is it
		not?

				BROWN
		Aye, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.

	A pause.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I have some letters in the saddle bag. 
		I wish to read them.

	BROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands
	her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I cannot read them like that.

	BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again.  VICTORIA cuts in.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		You will hand them to me as I require.

	BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER
	SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS
	prepare to serve soup.

	ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
	next to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in.

	But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he
	goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
	down.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room
	stops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with
	a look.

	An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
	amazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,
	hurries up to intercede.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits
		there.

				BROWN
		Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		By whose authority?

				BROWN
		My own.

	A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness.  BERTIE'S VALET stares
	icily at him.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		The order of seating at the Upper
		Servant's table is arranged personally
		by the Queen herself.

				BROWN
		That's a tautology lad.
			(unable to stop himself
			 seriously explaining it)
		If you say the Queen arranges
		something, you've no need to say she's
		done it personally.  That's
		understood.

	But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He
	stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of
	the under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried
	exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.

	Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a
	substantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty
	assistant dresser, sitting to his right.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Are you dresser to Her Majesty?

	She blinks nervously at him.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Assistant, sir, yes.

	BROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits.

				BROWN
		What's your name?

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Mary Taylor, sir.

				BROWN
		Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		I hope to go up next year.

				BROWN
		You wouldn't happen to know what the
		Queen's reading for recreation, would
		you, Mary?

	The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Lord Tennyson, sir?

	BROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant
	bursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly
	from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The
	old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
	table.

	BROWN looks up from his soup.

				BROWN
		Am I the only one eating?

	With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	A few days later.  A morning "drawing room."  Standing
	round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY
	CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that
	whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits
	knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat
	buttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself
	opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. 
	He runs through the daily itinerary.

				PONSONBY
		Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,
		at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve
		by a picnic in the grounds to
		celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. 
		Dispatches, as usual, at two.
			(finishes, then coughs)
		The Chancellor writes to say that, by
		happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes
		for the weekend.  He asks if Your
		Majesty might grant him an audience.

				VICTORIA
		Why?

				PONSONBY
		He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty
		might wish to be informed of the
		latest developments in government.

				VICTORIA
		No.  I shall be out walking.

	A beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs
	again, nervous.

				PONSONBY
		Then perhaps Your Majesty might
		consider it opportune if the Prince of
		Wales were to meet him on your behalf?

	VICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning.

				VICTORIA
		On no account.

	PONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up
	the reins.

				BERTIE
		Mama, I really do think it's time we
		made ourselves a little more ...
		available.

	VICTORIA carries on knitting.

				BERTIE (CONT'D)
		I think we must accept our position in
		the country is not entirely unrelated
		to the continued absence of the
		Monarchy from public life.
			(silence)
		I thought perhaps we might consider a
		small gesture of some kind?

	VICTORIA looks up sharply.

				VICTORIA
		Gesture?

				BERTIE
		I thought, a dinner for our
		ambassadors perhaps?

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in firmly)
		No dinners, Bertie.
			(beat)
		Why are you dressed for outdoors?

				BERTIE
		It's so infernally cold in here.

				VICTORIA
		Cold is good--
			(calling across)
		Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!

				JENNER
		I'm sorry, ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Cold is good!

				JENNER
		Excellent, ma'am, excellent.
			(trying his hand)
		But perhaps if her Majesty were to
		consider accompanying her new-found
		physical vigor with the benefits of
		mental activity...

				VICTORIA
			(becoming very agitated)
		Why am I being lectured in this way?!

				JENNER
		Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way
		did I wish to suggest--

				VICTORIA
			(cutting across him)
		I will not tolerate anybody lecturing
		me about the responsibility of the
		monarchy....

				BERTIE
		Mother....

				VICTORIA
		... Least of all my son.  It was his
		irresponsibility that drove my husband
		to his grave.

	An appalled silence.  With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs
	the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
	in another direction.

				BERTIE
		If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,
		then perhaps she might consider
		allowing the Prince of Wales to host--

				VICTORIA
		I do believe they send so many boxes
		to taunt me. 
		Doctor Jenner writes to them to say
		that my nerves are in an extremely
		fragile state and yet they continue to
		hound me with box after box after box
		after box after box!

	Silence.  VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out
	at the view.  Having recovered her composure, she turns to
	address them all.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I wish to take the Princesses for a
		swim.

	For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard.  She
	continues.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		The turns I have been taking in the
		grounds have proved most beneficial to
		me, and Brown thinks that salt water
		will do me good.

	Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR
	JENNER exchange a worried look.

	EXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen
	VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck
	into the freezing sea.  As she does so, the doors of the
	other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise
	follow her in.  Dignity does not allow them to shout out,
	but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.

	VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little
	circle.

				VICTORIA
		Don't potter, children.  Swim.

	Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

	Half an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and
	two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and
	onto her horse.  He glances at the stiff line of
	householders and mutters curtly to himself.

				BROWN
		You could buy that lot for garden
		ornaments and still see change from
		ten guineas.

	The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has
	overheard and tries to suppress a smile. 
	As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose. 
	BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Lift your foot, woman.

	Everyone hears this.  VICTORIA obeys.  Taking the reins, he
	then walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard.  As they vanish
	from site, we hear...

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		This nation is fortunate in so much as
		it is not governed by force...

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1866"

						FADE IN:

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

	The speech continues as we follow the progress of a
	Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches
	from knee to knee.  It is entitled, "Where is Britannia?"
	and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		... but by a chain of traditions that
		have been cherished from generation to
		generation, because in them -- in our
		traditions -- are embodied all the
		laws which have enabled us to create
		the greatest empire of modern times...

	During the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and
	lands on the knees of the young, earnest STANLEY.  As he
	frowns at the picture in front of him, DISRAELI winds up.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		... but, even though we have amassed
		great capital and even though we have
		established an industry with no
		parallel in the world, yet all these
		mighty creations are as nothing
		compared to the invisible customs that
		shape our lives.  To those honorable
		gentlemen of the opposition who seek
		to destroy the essential elements of
		this country, I say let them remember:
		England cannot begin again.

	During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time. 
	He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like
	Dickens on Slimfast.  He dresses almost dandyishly but
	speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance
	and cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back
	benchers, he sits.

	As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the
	Liberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every
	respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.  They stare
	levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
	smile.

	STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap.

				STANLEY
		Have you seen this?

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY

	A few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling
	down the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory
	back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
	offer their congratulations.

				STANLEY
		Should we take it seriously?

				DISRAELI
		The cartoon or Her Majesty's
		absenteeism?

				STANLEY
		Well, both.

				DISRAELI
		The question is, do we need her?

				STANLEY
		Surely, you're not suggesting we
		dispense--

				DISRAELI
		My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with
		only a handful of friends must respect
		public opinion.

	The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was
		right.  This country is not governed
		by wisdom but by talk.
			(beat)
		Granted, it wouldn't take much to
		winkle the old girl out of mourning,
		but if public opinion is against her,
		then it doesn't do to appear too
		close.

				STANLEY
		So?

				DISRAELI
		We'll see which way the wind blows.

	DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.

	EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.  It is freezing. 
	BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing
	Burns at the sea.

				BROWN
		My heart's in the Highlands, my heart
		is not here!  My heart's in the
		Highlands a-chasing the deer!  Chasing
		the wild deer and following the roe! 
		My heart's in the Highlands wherever I
		go!

	ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns.

	EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the
	cold beach to rub themselves dry.  BROWN is very energized.

				BROWN
		One box of biscuits, one box of drop
		tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen
		chocolate sponges.  It's the same
		order every week, but does anybody
		bother to check it?  Now she has to
		travel all the way to Balmoral without
		the few luxuries she actually enjoys.

				ARCHIE
		So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.

				BROWN
		Aye, but will they?

				ARCHIE
		John, it's not your problem what she
		eats.

				BROWN
		The woman's surrounded by fools!
			(beat)
		She has to be packed and ready to
		leave by seven thirty tomorrow
		morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll
		still be dressing her at eight.

	BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his
	brother.

				ARCHIE
		She's got an army of people to get her
		up and out.

				BROWN
		But I'm the only one she trusts.

	ARCHIE stares at him.  A beat.

				ARCHIE
		She'll blow hot and cold on you, John,
		she always does.  You want to be
		careful.

				BROWN
		I'm on ninety pounds a year plus
		seventy pounds for a pile of tartan
		I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much
		as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and
		that job's only for toffs.
			(raising his hip flask
			 triumphantly at the sea)
		I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! 
		Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping
		me now.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT

	A few days later.

	The clatter of carriage and horse as the ROYAL PARTY
	thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle.

	CAPTION: "BALMORAL"

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - TWILIGHT

	A mass of torches encircle the ROYAL PARTY as kilted
	GHILLIES and STAFF swarm round the carriage, opening doors
	and clambering off boxes while a regiment of PIPERS play
	them in.

	Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the
	door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by
	PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE.  Emerging from another
	carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim
	faced at the castle.  HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER
	alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves
	and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.

				PONSONBY
		Oh God, not the pipes!

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The next day.

	High over the vast, bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch
	Muick.  VICTORIA and BROWN are riding fast towards the top. 
	Reaching the summit, VICTORIA points excitedly at the far
	horizon.

				VICTORIA
		What are those?

				BROWN
		What?

				VICTORIA
		Those, over there, there.

				BROWN
			(horse chestnut trees...)
		Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.

				VICTORIA
			(beat)
		Craobhan-geanmchno...
			(bursts out laughing)
		How can I possibly say that with a
		straight face?!

	BROWN lets it go and they ride on.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I am thinking of publishing my
		"Highland Journals."

				BROWN
		Are they worth reading?

				VICTORIA
			(beat)
		I am told so.

				BROWN
		Who by?

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are
		charming.

				BROWN
		What does he know about the Highlands?

				VICTORIA
		He has been attending at Balmoral for
		many years.

				BROWN
		That doesn't make him an expert.

				VICTORIA
		His remarks were directed at the
		quality of the writing, not its
		subject.

				BROWN
		I don't groom a horse to have it
		admired by others, I groom it because
		it needs grooming.

				VICTORIA
			(curtly)
		I do not do it for others.  But
		Ponsonby thinks they are good.

				BROWN
		Just say what you have to say, woman. 
		What other people think shouldn't
		matter to you.

				VICTORIA
			(snapping)
		Of course I shall say what I have to
		say.  I always do.

	The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on.

				BROWN
		Aye, well, if all you want is a good
		opinion then he'd be sure to oblige
		you.

				VICTORIA
			(riding alongside)
		What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was
		their literary merit, a skill not
		intimately associated with the
		knowledge of grooming.
			(beat)
		Literary appreciation does not begin
		and end with Tennyson.

	BROWN lowers his head.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
			(in a softer tone)
		I mention you in them.

	BROWN says nothing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		In particular, the occasion when
		Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage
		overturned during a storm and you
		demonstrated such loyal service in
		returning the Queen and the Princesses
		safely to Balmoral.

	Taking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds
	it out to him.  A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		For friendship.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	A few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand
	at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary.

				BROWN
			(briskly)
		She'll be away on Friday between eight
		o'clock and six in the evening to
		visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's
		to make the journey there and back in
		the day she's to have no distractions
		the night before.  She'll take a light
		supper alone in her private drawing
		room and retire early.

				PONSONBY
		She'll need to sign dispatches before
		she retires.

				BROWN
		That can wait till the weekend.

				PONSONBY
		There are important papers from --

				BROWN
		It can wait.  Anything else?

				JENNER
		Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such
		a long journey?  She has only just
		recovered from a severe head cold.

				BROWN
		If I thought she wasn't up to it, I
		wouldn't let her go, would I?

	BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving
	PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	The next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the
	grounds.  VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one
	side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.

	BERTIE is in mid-plea.

				BERTIE
		Surely it is for the gentlemen to
		decide when to stop...

				VICTORIA
		It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It
		should be discouraged.

				BERTIE
		Yes, but isn't midnight a little
		excessive?

				VICTORIA
		It is quite late enough.

				BERTIE
		But mama, the room was built expressly
		for that purpose.  It has been a
		smoking-room by tradition ever since
		father --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in angrily)
		Brown's responsibilities are onerous
		enough already.  He has far too much
		to do without having to stay up all
		night waiting for you to go to bed. 
		The smoking-room will be closed and
		the lights put out at twelve o'clock.

				BERTIE
		Mama...

				VICTORIA
		And that is my last word on the
		matter.

				BERTIE
		Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think
		it's too much that the gentlemen of
		the house should be dictated to by a
		servant.

				BROWN
		It's the Queen's decision.

				BERTIE
		I beg your pardon?
			(to VICTORIA)
		Mama...?

	Before Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his
	face.

				BROWN
		I think you should go now.
			(beat)
		You've tired your mother enough.

	BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.  He glances at
	his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if
	she has not heard.  BERTIE turns and storms away.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	JOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage
	watching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple,
	MR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying
	desperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden
	visit.  They fling open the windows, slosh water on the
	fire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions,
	dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
	up, all in the space of a few seconds.

				BROWN
		There's really no need for this.

				MRS GRANT
		I'll not have her seeing it like it
		is!
			(beat)
		I know she means well, but I wish
		she'd warn us she was coming.

				BROWN
		She thinks if she warned you, you'd go
		pouring water on the fire and stuffing
		the knitting under the sofa.

				MR GRANT
		Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being
		house-proud.

	MRS GRANT surveys the room critically.

				MRS GRANT
		All right.
			(beat)
		Show her in.

	EXT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA sits on a horse and trap.  BROWN steps out and
	helps her down.

				BROWN
		They're ready now.

				VICTORIA
		I hope they didn't go to any trouble,
		John.

				BROWN
		Ah, well...

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one
	military row, smoke still steaming off the fire.  BROWN
	stands behind her, barely able to contain himself.  But for
	VICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as
	perfectly normal.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Grant.  How good it is to see you.

				MR GRANT
			(bowing deeply)
		Your Majesty.

				VICTORIA
		Mrs Grant.  How is your knee?  Has the
		pain eased a little?

				MRS GRANT
			(bobbing in terror)
		Oh not so bad, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Good.  Oh and here are Douglas and
		John.  Haven't you grown?

				MRS GRANT
			(still bobbing away)
		Growing all the time, ma'am.

	MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a
	chair.

				MR GRANT
		Will you sit, ma'am?

	From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she
	smiles as she is led to the chair.  She points to a picture
	on the wall and her good humour is infectious.

				VICTORIA
		I know that!  That's Cairn Lochan.  We
		picnicked there once, did we not,
		John?

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS,
	DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES.  Into this
	brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the
	young STANLEY.  It is all eyes and nods here.  Everyone
	knows everyone.

				DISRAELI
		Ah, the greasy pole.

				MARY ANNE
		Don't be facetious, dear. Remember
		your position.

				DISRAELI
		It's my position I'm thinking of.

	Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of
	acolytes.

				STANLEY
		I see the Prince of Wales is here.

				DISRAELI
		I hope he got his mother's permission.

	STANLEY smiles faintly.  DISRAELI homes in on a punter and
	raises his hand, already working the room.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		Lord Salisbury!

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	The society party is hotting up.  STANLEY is deep in
	conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
			(ridiculously pleased with
			 herself)
		Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound
		foolish?  Because she looks after the
		Browns and lets the sovereigns take
		care of themselves!

	A peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up.

				DISRAELI
		And in your opinion?  Is she foolish?

	The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
		Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's
		hardly right, is it?

				DISRAELI
		What?

				SOCIETY LADY 1
		Well, the Queen and --
			(appalled whisper)
		Mr Brown.

	DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.

				DISRAELI
		La superstition met le monde entier en
		flammes.

				SOCIETY LADY 2
			(thick as shit)
		I beg your pardon?

				DISRAELI
			(changing tack)
		Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown?

				STANLEY
		He is her personal servant, I believe.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
			(knowingly)
		Follows her wherever she goes.

				DISRAELI
		He would hardly make a very good
		personal assistant if he did not.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of
	QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS
	GRANT nervously prattles on.

				MRS GRANT
		... it's not my best china.  I mean,
		it is my best china now, but the
		family set got stolen last summer.

				VICTORIA
		Oh, I'm so sorry ...

				MRS GRANT
		Of course it was no-one on the Estate. 
		More likely one of the lads from
		Braemar.  Or further even.
			(beat)
		I'll fetch the salt.

	MRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the
	spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside
	the plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries
	on.

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES.

				BERTIE
		Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.

				DISRAELI
		Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure
		to see you here.

				BERTIE
		Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in
		sugar...?

				DISRAELI
		I don't think I've had that pleasure.

	DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles
	with drink.  MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while
	BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.

				BERTIE
		No doubt you've heard the rumors.

				DISRAELI
		I take no account of gossip, Your
		Highness.

				BERTIE
		My concern is for the reputation of
		the Monarchy.

				DISRAELI
		Of course.

				BERTIE
		I fear the influence he has on her. 
		The man's word is not to be credited. 
		He is an arriviste of the very lowest
		water.
			(beat)
		She's having a bust cast of him.  In
		Nero Marquino marble.

				DISRAELI
		I see.

				BERTIE
		I would talk to her myself, but she
		won't listen to me.  She must be
		persuaded, by someone she respects, to
		abandon this ridiculous favoritism
		before a situation develops.

				DISRAELI
		A situation?

				BERTIE
		I don't imagine you frequent the
		Republican Clubs.  But the fact that
		neither you nor I are members should
		not blind us to the significance of
		their existence.
			(beat)
		The Tory Party has always been our
		party.

				DISRAELI
		I'm flattered you think so.

				BERTIE
		I tell you, if we don't stick together
		on this, you could find yourself First
		President's Opposition.
			(murdering it)
		Du Royaum Uni.

				DISRAELI
		Quite.

	A beat.

				BERTIE
		I don't think we can overstate the
		seriousness of this.

	DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party. 
	The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.

				STANLEY
		What did he want?

				DISRAELI
		To know when he'll be king.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large
	table.  Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams
	proudly at BROWN as he tells a story.

				BROWN
		... so Grant here and myself are
		riding over Lochnagar and the rain's
		pouring down in sheets and all we're
		thinking about is getting home for a
		drink, when through the gloom Grant
		spots a couple of poachers.  He gives
		me a shout and we chase them down
		towards the loch until Grant has your
		men up against the stacks and he's
		shouting and cursing at them, "Why are
		you poaching on Royal land?!"  And one
		of the little fellas looks up at him
		and says, "coz we've come up in the
		world."

	For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then
	BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS
	relax.  Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. 
	Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal
	quantities of whiskey all round.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DUSK

	Later that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of
	worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps.

	Through the light, BROWN and VICTORIA clatter into the
	courtyard on the horse and trap.  DOCTOR JENNER breaks
	through the crowd in a state of high excitement.

				JENNER
		Your Majesty!  Thank goodness you're
		safe!  I'll have a bath prepared
		immediately.  I recommend Macdonald's
		African Embrocation --

				BROWN
			(cutting in)
		Ah, pipe down, man.  The woman's fine.

				VICTORIA
		We stayed a little longer than
		expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It
		was most agreeable.

				PONSONBY
		We were expecting you to return by
		six.

				VICTORIA
		And now I am back.

	BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.

				BROWN
		We took a nip of whiskey.

				VICTORIA
		To keep out the cold.

				BROWN
		Aye.

	VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before
	walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...

				VICTORIA
		Thank you, John.

	BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up,
	he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in
	utter disbelief at what she has just said.  He turns and
	leads the horse back to the stables.

				JENNER
			(under his breath)
		She's drunk.

	PONSONBY doesn't answer.  He is watching BROWN very
	closely.

				JENNER (CONT'D)
		A distinct flushing around the cheeks. 
		She was drunk, I tell you.

				PONSONBY
		No, she wasn't.

	Silence.  JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY.

				JENNER
		Surely not ...

	PONSONBY's face is set hard.

				PONSONBY
		Don't even think about it.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

	A crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of
	the annual Ghillie's Ball.

	The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them
	beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and
	JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.

	PONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching.  Close-up
	on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly.

				JENNER
		Pandora's Box ...

	With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and
	BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence. 
	A King and his Queen.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Later that night.

	We find BROWN, slouched on the ground, dead-drunk and
	snoring loudly.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	A few days later, four JOURNALISTS are scrabbling up a
	stony path, armed with telescopes.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	A large ROYAL PARTY is making its way smoothly and quietly
	up the mountain.  BROWN is on horseback, leading VICTORIA
	on a dapple-grey.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS rattle up the hill.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS scramble up to some gorse bushes, dump
	themselves down and start setting up the telescopes.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	BROWN and VICTORIA near the summit when BROWN suddenly
	stops.  He stiffens and turns to face the wind, as if
	catching a scent.  VICTORIA frowns.

				VICTORIA
		What is it, John?
			(beat)
		John?

				BROWN
		I heard something.

	BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		I won't be long.

	He dismounts and races off.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS are peering through their telescopes.

				JOURNALIST 1
		Where did he get to?  I've lost him?

	Below them, BROWN races across the riverbank and
	undergrowth, unseen.

				JOURNALIST 2
		I don't know if there's much worth
		writing about.

				JOURNALIST 1
		Hard to tell.

	BROWN rears up above them and stops.

				BROWN
		This close enough for you?  Go on!  On
		your way!  You filthy scavengers!

	The JOURNALISTS scramble to their feet and start legging it
	down the hill, while BROWN roars furiously, hurling their
	bags after them.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		You leave her alone, do you hear?!

	The JOURNALISTS vanish below the hillside.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	That night.

	BROWN is standing at the head of the table, yelling at the
	UPPER SERVANTS, irrespective of ARCHIE or anyone.

				BROWN
		If I catch the miserable by-blow who
		told those men where she'd be, then
		I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock
		Wemyss, so I will!!

	ARCHIE glances up at BERTIE'S VALET.  He is staring down at
	the table, teeth gritted, fists clenched.  BROWN rounds on
	them all again.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		What happens to John Brown is his
		business, but the Queen's security
		will never be compromised!

				BERTIE'S VALET
		We --

				BROWN
		You'll talk when I'm finished!

	BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns
	back to the table.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		That kind of disloyalty will not be
		tolerated in this house, is that
		clear?
			(beat, yelling)
		I said, is that clear?!

	There is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and
	storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

	A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to
	his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his
	copy of Punch.

				JENNER
		"Court Circular, Balmoral."
			(beat)
		"On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a
		display of sheep-dipping by local
		farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a
		seance where he was pleased to listen
		to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr
		Robert Burns himself ..."

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same
	journal.

				JENNER (O.S.)
		"... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked
		on the slopes, accompanied by family
		and friend ..."

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door.

				JENNER (O.S.)
		Mr Brown retired early.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

	BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his
	copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled.

				BROWN
		If I find out that you had anything to
		do with this, I will have you sacked.

				PONSONBY
		I believe that decision rests with Her
		Majesty.

				BROWN
		Don't think I can't persuade her.

				PONSONBY
		I don't doubt that the Queen was
		highly amused.  She has always had a
		very healthy sense of humor.

				BROWN
		This is a slur on her good name.

				PONSONBY
		In as much as the article is about
		yourself, I think you must now accept
		that the public has a right to its
		interest in you.

				BROWN
		Nobody has any rights over me.

				PONSONBY
		We are all of us subject to forces
		beyond our control, Mr Brown, even
		you.

	BROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat.

				BROWN
		You'll regret saying that.

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1867"

						FADE IN:

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

	Chaos.  The Tories are losing the vote as both sides of the
	house stand and shout at each other while the SPEAKER rises
	in his chair.

				SPEAKER (O.S.)
		Order!  Order!  ORDER!

	A buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote. 
	The COUNTERS approach the chair.

				SPEAKER (CONT'D)
		Result of the vote to the first
		reading of the Bill to Disestablish
		the Irish Church.

	A murmur of excitement from the LIBERALS.

				SPEAKER (CONT'D)
		Order!

	A beat.

				COUNTER
		Ayes to the right, three hundred and
		thirty, noes to the left, two hundred
		and sixty-five...

	By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in
	cheers from the Liberal benches.  DISRAELI and the rest of
	the front bench sit in stony silence.

	Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed
	maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting:

				DILKE
		Mr Speaker, I table a motion in
		furtherance of the Bill to
		Disestablish the Monarchy!

	A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again.

				SPEAKER
		Order!  Order!!  ORDER!!!

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	An hour later the house is empty except for a few
	straggling MPs hurrying home.  An exhausted DISRAELI stands
	in the corridor with STANLEY.

				DISRAELI
		We're going to lose.

				STANLEY
		You can't know that for sure.

				DISRAELI
		Gladstone's got his party facing the
		same way for the first time in years. 
		We need help.
			(long beat)
		Where is the old girl?

				STANLEY
		Who?

				DISRAELI
		Mrs Brown.

				STANLEY
		It's questionable whether there's any
		advantage to be had from that
		direction.  She's never been less
		popular.

				DISRAELI
		In the press, perhaps.
			(holding up Punch)
		But she's sold more copies of her
		Highland Journal in three months than
		Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time
		to wheel her out.

				STANLEY
		She's refusing to leave Balmoral.

				DISRAELI
		What's her excuse this time?

				STANLEY
		The Princess Louisa is too ill to
		move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather
		upset at the recent spate of bad
		publicity.
			(beat)
		You're smiling.

				DISRAELI
		I was trying to imagine "rather
		upset."

	The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the
	lobby doors.  DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.

				DISRAELI
		Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to
		spare the time.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		I came as quickly as I could.

				DISRAELI
		You've seen the latest cartoon in
		Punch, I take it?

				DEAN WELLSELLY
			(completely lost)
		I beg your pardon?

	DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean
	Wellselly.  The Dean clears his throat and starts to read.

				DISRAELI
			(as Wellselly reads)
		One of our madder brethren in the
		house was calling for disestablishment
		of the monarchy.

	Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Good Lord.

				STANLEY
			(playing the soft glove)
		I'm sure it won't come to that.

				DISRAELI
			(the hard glove)
		No.  But it has now become a matter
		for our consciences.
			(beat)
		I was just telling Stanley how vital
		it is that the nation should feel the
		visible influence of the Sovereign. 
		As a reminder that Parliament, indeed
		my own ministry, depends on the will
		of the Queen.

	DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely.  Over his shoulder,
	STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the
	party political maneuver into a moral imperative.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		I couldn't agree with you more, but I
		am only Dean of Windsor.  I don't
		understand what ...

	DISRAELI interrupts.

				DISRAELI
		We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is
		interesting Her Majesty in some of the
		forms of worship associated with ...
		low-church Presbyterian.

	Silence.  DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of
	unrestrained horror.  Low-church.  Presbyterian.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		What can we do?

				DISRAELI
		Oh, several things.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Some days later.

	Queen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands
	in front of her, holding a copy of The Times.

				VICTORIA
		Read it.

				PONSONBY
		Again?

				VICTORIA
		Read it!

	PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.

				PONSONBY
		"The Times wishes to join the rest of
		Her Majesty's loyal subjects in
		expressing its deep joy at the news
		that the Queen is soon to come out of
		her mourning."

	VICTORIA glowers at him.

				VICTORIA
		Who told them that?

				PONSONBY
		I have no idea.

				VICTORIA
		Why not?

				PONSONBY
		I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser
		than yourself.

	Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him.

				VICTORIA
		No-one should think themselves wiser
		than me!
			(beat)
		It is not for any of the Queen's
		subjects to presume to tell Her
		Majesty when and where She should come
		out of mourning.  It is the Queen's
		sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is
		Her overwhelming amount of work and
		responsibility, work which She feels
		will soon wear her out entirely!

				PONSONBY
		Your Majesty --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting right through him)
		Is it not enough that She is uncheered
		and unguided that she should also have
		to suffer these malicious rumors?!
			(a pause, more quietly)
		I am not a fool.
			(beat)
		I know there are those in the
		establishment too afraid to attack me
		and so they attack my dearest friends. 
		Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all
		I have left of Albert.
			(beat)
		And now they attack Brown too.

	She looks up, eyes blazing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I will not give him up to them.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, ROOM ADJOINING DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	BROWN is guarding the door to the drawing room while the
	balding BERTIE muscles up, eye ball to eye ball.

				BERTIE
		I wish to see my mother.

				BROWN
		She's busy.

				BERTIE
		Convey her a message.

				BROWN
		She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk
		to her there.

				BERTIE
		Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to
		speak with her urgently about matters
		concerning the press.

				BROWN
		Are you deaf as well as stupid?

	A split-second.  BERTIE gapes at him.

				BERTIE
		What did you say?

				BROWN
		I said, are you deaf as well as
		stupid?

				BERTIE
		Do you know who you address, sir?

				BROWN
		Whom you address.

				BERTIE
		The future King!

	A beat.

				BROWN
		Well, everyone's entitled to their
		opinion.

				BERTIE
		Out of my way!

	Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past.  Suddenly
	BROWN loses it completely.  He grabs the Prince of Wales by
	the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his
	face.

				BROWN
		LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!

	For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he
	has gone too far.  A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face,
	then ...

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

	Weeks later.

	In a roar of hooves and wheels, the Royal Carriage sweeps
	into the huge quadrangle.  JOHN BROWN stands rigid on the
	box, glowering at all the world.

	CAPTION: "WINDSOR"

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass
	of SERVANTS rush in and out, ferrying bags an trunks.

	BROWN marches in, still charged-up from the strain of the
	journey's watchfulness.  He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching
	a break.

				BROWN
		You!  What's your business here?!

				UNDER-PORTER
			(jumping to)
		Under-porter, sir.

				BROWN
		Well, don't stand where you shouldn't!

	The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs.  A few SERVANTS
	exchange looks.  BROWN seems more determined than ever to
	exert his control.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

	That night.

	Carrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks
	towards the stables.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

	The next day.

	BROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the
	grounds.  He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right,
	searching for intruders.  They are being followed at a
	distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback.  VICTORIA frowns
	peevishly.

				VICTORIA
		Must they always follow us?

				BROWN
		I ordered it.  It's for your own
		safety.

				VICTORIA
		Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch
		what I eat next.

	BROWN doesn't react.  A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Am I not safe enough with you, John?

				BROWN
		Aye.
			(looking away)
		But there are Fenians reported on the
		mainland.

				VICTORIA
			(tutting irritably)
		The threat from the Irish is greatly
		exaggerated, I'm sure.

				BROWN
			(snapping back)
		I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

	BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the
	conversation.  A beat.  He pulls up suddenly, staring at
	the shadows in the copse.

				VICTORIA
		Is anything the matter, John?
			(beat)
		John?

	He stares for along moment and then lets it go.

				BROWN
		Nothing's the matter.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

	BROWN marches down the line of horse boxes.  A stable-lad,
	BARNEY, is feeding the horses.  He looks twitchy.

				BROWN
		Hey, Barney.

				BARNEY
		Mr Brown, sir --

				BROWN
		It's cold out there tonight, Barney.

	Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.  The animal
	lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Yeah, there's a good girl.
			(to Barney)
		Have you had a look at this hoof?  She
		was limping badly.  I think there
		might be a stone in it.

				BARNEY
		Yeah, yeah, I did.

				BROWN
		Good man.  And is she all right?

				BARNEY
		Yeah.

				BROWN
		Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? 
		Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you
		know the Queen's riding tomorrow?

				BARNEY
		Yeah.

				BROWN
			(beat)
		Are you all right, Barney?

	BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.  The
	split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Oh, aye...

	The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight.

	As he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a
	fist and fling the others off him.  But the FIRST MAN is up
	again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back. 
	The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly
	strong.  Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them
	fight to force him back.  BARNEY stands transfixed in
	horror.

	Dumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start
	kicking the shit out of him.  BROWN curls into a ball, jaw
	locked, hands over his head.  Not a sound.

	Finally, they back off, panting hard.  The FIRST MAN pulls
	out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces
	whiskey down his throat.  It spills over his face and
	dribbles down his neck.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.

	VICTORIA is standing at the windows.  The door opens and
	LADY ELY walks in.

				VICTORIA
		Well?

				LADY ELY
		Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

				VICTORIA
		Why?

				LADY ELY
		I believe he is unwell, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Unwell?

				LADY ELY
		I understand he was in a fight.

				VICTORIA
		Has he been hurt?

				LADY ELY
		I believe not, ma'am.  I understand --
		he'd had rather too much to drink.

	VICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk.

				VICTORIA
		You may go.

	LADY ELY bows and walks out.  VICTORIA stares at the desk a
	moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work.  She
	cannot.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

	BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his
	undergarments.  His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid
	with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting
	his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending
	to his wounds.

				BROWN
		And she sent no word down?

				ARCHIE
		They said you were drunk.
			(beat)
		Why don't you tell her the truth?

				BROWN
		She'll think it's her fault for
		keeping me.

	ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly
	reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.

				ARCHIE
		What are you doing?!

				BROWN
		I'm getting dressed.

				ARCHIE
		You've got three broken ribs, man!

				BROWN
		I've got my duties to attend to.

				ARCHIE
		Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit
		state to go anywhere.

				BROWN
		She'll be worried about me.

				ARCHIE
		She'll get over it.

				BROWN
		I can't let her down now, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		And when was the last time she put
		herself out for you?  Look, John,
		whatever she says to you now, in the
		end you're still a servant.

				BROWN
		Oh, I'm much more than that.

				ARCHIE
		Aye, she may say that to you, but the
		woman can say what she wants.

				BROWN
		You watch your tongue.

				ARCHIE
		Come on, man, I'm telling you what you
		already know.

				BROWN
		You know nothing about her!

				ARCHIE
		When are you gonna see it, John?  She
		doesn't give a damn about you.

	BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card
	showing a coy picture of a pretty woman.  He holds it up,
	eyes blazing.

				BROWN
		From the Queen!

	He reads out the inscription.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		My lips may give a message better of
		Christmas love than e'en this letter.
			(beat)
		To my best friend, J.B. from his best
		friend, V.R.
			(he thrusts it in his
			 brother's face)
		Best friend!

				ARCHIE
		Aye.

				BROWN
		She means it.

	ARCHIE stares at him.

				ARCHIE
		She'll drop you.  When she's done with
		you, she'll drop you.

				BROWN
		Get out.
			(beat)
		Out!

	ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		OUT!!

	ARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.  VICTORIA sits at her desk.  PONSONBY hands
	her letters to sign.

				PONSONBY
		... to be followed by a visit from
		Lady Bridport.  She is keen to secure
		a place for her niece as Maid of
		Honor.

	VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.

				VICTORIA
		I am tired.

	PONSONBY coughs.

				PONSONBY
		There is one other matter.

				VICTORIA
		What is it?

				PONSONBY
		I have a letter, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		From whom?

				PONSONBY
		From Princess Helena and other members
		of your family.

				VICTORIA
			(stiffening defensively)
		My family is quite capable of
		communicating with the Queen in
		person.

	PONSONBY does not reply.  Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to
	ask.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		What do they want?

				PONSONBY
		They are demanding the dismissal of
		John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

	VICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

	VICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel, nervously
	fingering her handkerchief.  Waiting for her, smiling
	softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		You wished to see me, ma'am?

	She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

	A few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated
	in a corner of the chapel, talking softly.  She cannot
	bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how
	carefully he is watching her throughout the interview. 
	This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles
	to be as honest as possible.

				VICTORIA
		My husband tried always to make me
		think more subtly.  Of course he
		taught me so much and I can never
		repay my debt to him, or the love I
		feel, even now.  But, in truth, I
		think I am someone who can only feel
		things while they are alive to me. 
		For that reason, I know I do not have
		a subtle mind.  I know that.  But I
		work hard and I try to do my duty.
			(she hesitates; she is
			 struggling now)
		However, I have noticed of late that
		my feelings of grief are not so strong
		and -- that I find myself leaning more
		upon the comfort of living friends.
			(beat)
		Friends close to me now.

	She stops herself.  She is crying.  DEAN WELLSELLY watches
	her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words
	carefully.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Your Majesty, a settled resignation is
		more lasting proof of affection than
		active grief.  If the good Lord sees
		fit to bring one into contact with
		congenial fellow beings, one should
		not analyze one's reaction too deeply. 
		To allow oneself to be comforted by
		someone else need not imply any
		disloyalty to the memory of the loved
		one.

	Silence.  VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel. 
	Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her
	disappointment turns to anger.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day, VICTORIA stands at the far window and her
	back to the room.  Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and
	his siblings.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry.

	PONSONBY steps forward.

				PONSONBY
		Ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Please tell the Princess, and other
		signatories to this letter, that the
		Queen will not be dictated to, or made
		to alter, in any way, what she has
		found to answer for her comfort.
			(beat)
		Do I make myself clear?

				PONSONBY
		Ma'am.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA
		You may go.

	They all file out.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

	A few days later.

	BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback.  Although
	better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised. 
	They turn a corner banked by trees.  BROWN is watching the
	QUEEN closely.  She stops.

				VICTORIA
		I would like to get down.

	Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her
	horse.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		John?

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		I was told you were in a fight.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Has someone seen to those bruises?

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

	A beat.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Yes?

				BROWN
		Having considered my position here at
		court, I have come to the conclusion
		that it is in the best interest of
		Your Majesty that I should resign.

				VICTORIA
		I do not accept.

	A beat.

				BROWN
		I had foreseen that you would not. 
		But Your Majesty should understand --
		that my mind will not be changed in
		this.  I leave for Deeside --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in)
		The Queen forbids it.
			(beat)
		I cannot allow it because I cannot
		live without you.  Without you, I
		cannot find the strength to be who I
		must be.  Please.

	She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then
	looks at him, utterly helpless.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Promise me you won't let them send me
		back.

	A long silence.  BROWN holds her hand tight.

				BROWN
		I promise.

						FADE TO BLACK.

	EXT. LOWLANDS - DAY

	A few weeks later.

	A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland
	landscape.

				DISRAELI (V.O.)
		Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three
		hours on the Irish Church Bill ... I
		am as guilty as the rest of
		underestimating his reforming zeal.
		Tory days may be numbered, but I fancy
		there yet remains one last hope of
		deliverance.  Wheresoever the blame
		lies, we must now close ranks and
		defend Mrs Brown's England.  As for my
		interminable journey to the land of
		Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur ...

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	DISRAELI hurries through the pouring rain.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		... no Prime Minister made greater
		sacrifice than attempting to run the
		country six hundred miles north of
		civilization.

	Reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors
	bang behind him.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.

	QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with
	great vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish
	ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,
	almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE
	LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand
	in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. 
	Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a
	quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.

	DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards
	off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician
	to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This
	man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his
	smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she
	belts, until her children are drowned out completely.

	And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops
	playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The
	HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,
	but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.

				VICTORIA
		How dare the Irish break with the
		Anglicans? 
		If Albert were alive today he would
		never allow the Crown to give up
		Church patronage.  No, the Irish must
		be told, very firmly, to stay exactly
		where they are.  It is the thin edge
		of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.  Next, you
		will be telling me that the Crown no
		longer governs this nation.

	A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.

				DISRAELI
		Your Majesty remains at the very
		epicenter of governance.  As for your
		people, look no further than the sales
		of your Highland Journals to see in
		what affection the nation holds their
		Queen.
			(beat)
		You sell even more copies than Mr
		Dickens.

				VICTORIA
		But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.

	VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.  DISRAELI acknowledges it,
	then steers the conversation back.

				DISRAELI
		Of course I understand your concern. 
		You miss your people.
			(a pause)
		And they miss you.

	VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the
	implied criticism.

				VICTORIA
		Then they may read about me.

				DISRAELI
		Indeed, and for that they are
		eternally grateful.

				VICTORIA
		Is that not enough?

				DISRAELI
		In so many ways ... and yet it is your
		presence they crave.  A figurehead.

	VICTORIA has the measure of him.

				VICTORIA
		I never thought to be bullied by you,
		Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought,
		understood a widow's grief.

				DISRAELI
		Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for
		the nation, only for myself.  As Prime
		Minister I confess I miss your
		presence, but that is only an
		expression of my own selfish desires
		and I should not burden you with it.

	The Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA
	acknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks
	directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.

				VICTORIA
		I stay here because I am happy.
			(beat)
		Is that such a terrible crime?

				DISRAELI
		No, ma'am.

	At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.

				BROWN
		Time for your walk.

	Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts
	following him out.  As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.

				VICTORIA
		This is my good John Brown.

				DISRAELI
			(taking him in)
		Yes.

				VICTORIA
		I have asked him to show you a little
		of Highland life while you are with us
		at Balmoral.

	BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.

				BROWN
		What brings you here?

				DISRAELI
		A man can refuse only so many
		invitations from his Queen.  It was
		remiss of me not to come earlier.

	VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN stares.

				BROWN
		What do you know about the Highlands?

				DISRAELI
		I am a blank sheet.

				BROWN
		Do you hunt?

				DISRAELI
		Occasionally.

				BROWN
		Dare say you can be taught.

				DISRAELI
		To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

				BROWN
		If you hunt, you kill.

	DISRAELI counters effortlessly.

				DISRAELI
		Well then, I'll do my best.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of
	shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against
	heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud,
	crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly
	cold.

	Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. 
	The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way up
	the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and
	dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then
	the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front.

	Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up
	the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men
	on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other
	GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them
	ARCHIE.

	Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts.

	He listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his
	quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen
	dismount as quietly as they can.

	As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his
	side.  He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and
	drinks.  All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	The stalking.

	Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to
	each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill.

	DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes
	on his man, trying to make no sound.

	Suddenly, BROWN stops.  Very slowly he rises.  DISRAELI
	rides alongside and sees ...

	A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside.

	Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his
	rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.  With a
	deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines.  BROWN
	stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his
	shoulder and fires.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	The kill.

	A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ...

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his
	side.

				BROWN
			(demonstrating with his
			 rifle)
		Always remember, you keep it tight to
		your shoulder, you absorb the kick. 
		Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's
		Gladstone.

				DISRAELI
			(smiling)
		Quite.

	BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who
	declines.  He watches BROWN take a long swig.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	That night.

	BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.  He has
	a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list. 
	Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh,
	are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty
	ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIE'S VALET.  They each step up,
	one at a time, to make their report.

				BROWN
			(ticking as he goes)
		... Back doors, West Wing.

				UPPER SERVANT 1
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Side doors, East Wing.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Louder, girl!

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
			(creasing up)
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Kitchen and lower house.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Back and upper corridors.

				UPPER SERVANT 2
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Front door.
			(beat)
		Checked and locked.

	Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and
	sits.  On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid
	a clatter of cutlery and chat.

	ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched
	over his plate, pecking at his food.

	Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up.  BERTIE'S VALET
	coughs.  BROWN slowly lifts his head.  His eyes have the
	slightly unfocused look of too much drink.  It is clear to
	ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.

				BERTIE'S VALET
			(with a smug smile)
		Did you see any Irish assassins today,
		Mr Brown?

	Brown doesn't react.

				BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
		We heard the dogs were Fenian
		sympathizers.

	Brown drinks.

				BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
		Or was it the stag ...?

	Everyone bursts out laughing.  Brown slams down his glass.

				BROWN
		There's not a soul here cares about
		that wee woman's safety except me! 
		She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there
		to look out for her --

	He stops.  ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair
	and pulls gently on his arm.

	BROWN stares at the SERVANTS.  Everyone is about to burst
	out laughing.  Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his
	chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away.

	As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in
	the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	BROWN is lying on a grubby bed.  ARCHIE is looking around
	the untidy room.  For the first time, he notices a thick
	manuscript on the table.  BROWN follows his eyes.

				ARCHIE
		What's this?

				BROWN
		It's a diary.

				ARCHIE
		Be careful who sees it.

				BROWN
		What do you take me for?

	ARCHIE turns back to BROWN.

				ARCHIE
		You should have someone look after
		you.

				BROWN
		I'm all right.  I just need to rest up
		a wee bit.
			(feeling everything spin)
		The room ... You don't have to stay.

	BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift.  ARCHIE watches
	over him.

				ARCHIE
		The place is a mess.

				BROWN
		I can't move to tidy.

				ARCHIE
		It's what the maids are for.

				BROWN
		I'm not having some prattler going
		through my things.

	A beat.

				ARCHIE
		Won't you give yourself a rest, John? 
		She's other people to look out for
		her.

				BROWN
		She needs me, Archie.  She canna do
		without me, she said it to my face.
			(his hands come up to cover
			 his eyes)
		How can I stop now?

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY

	Dawn the next morning.

	BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the
	stairs.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --
	to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up
	in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket.

				BROWN
		You sent for me.

				DISRAELI
		I've been called back to London.  My
		last day.  I thought I might take a
		walk on Lochnagar.

	BROWN stares straight back.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	An hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill.  BROWN has
	his head down, on with the job.  DISRAELI slows to a halt.

				DISRAELI
		Princes and Lords are but the breath
		of kings, An honest man's the noblest
		work of God.
			(beat)
		You must miss such magnificent views.

				BROWN
		I don't think about it.

	They reach the top and continue along the high ground. 
	DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp.

				DISRAELI
		Forgive me, I've called you out and
		you should have been resting.

				BROWN
		I'm fine.

				DISRAELI
		You're injured.

				BROWN
		It's nothing.

				DISRAELI
		Still, someone must attend you.  Your
		wife should not have let you out.

				BROWN
		I'm not married.

				DISRAELI
			(deadpan)
		Oh.

				BROWN
		This is the top.

	DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.

				DISRAELI
		I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am
		not married myself, I see my wife so
		little.  But I'm forgetting the
		rewards.

	He looks across.  BROWN keeps staring ahead.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		The look on their faces when one walks
		into the room.  Still gives one a
		ridiculous thrill.

				BROWN
		I wouldn't know.

				DISRAELI
		Surely --

				BROWN
			(interrupts)
		What I do, I do for my Queen.

				DISRAELI
		Was there never ambition?

				BROWN
			(beat)
		Maybe, once.

				DISRAELI
		Then I envy yo.

				BROWN
		Why?

				DISRAELI
		To have achieved one's ambition, or to
		have reconciled oneself to its limits,
		is a lifetime's work.

				BROWN
		I do what I do.

				DISRAELI
		For Her Majesty.

				BROWN
		Aye.

				DISRAELI
		But yourself?
			(beat)
		What about John Brown?

				BROWN
		I said.
			(beat)
		I serve the Queen.

				DISRAELI
		No other aspiration?

	BROWN stares for a long moment.  Finally he speaks.

				BROWN
		To see her safe.

	DISRAELI steps a little closer.

				DISRAELI
		You will not be unaware of the threat
		now posed by Republicanism.

				BROWN
		Why do you think I keep her here?

				DISRAELI
		Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It
		is her very isolation that encourages
		the malcontents.  The longer she is
		away, the stronger they become; and
		who, honestly, can promise security
		against that?  However many doors you
		lock, someone will always get in. 
		Even here.

	BROWN watches him, eyes alert.

				BROWN
		So...?

				DISRAELI
		The truth is, the Queen would be safer
		doing her duty and returning south to
		her public.  John Bull loves her and
		John Bull is her best defense.

				BROWN
		Her mind is set.  She won't change
		now.

				DISRAELI
		She trusts you, John.

	DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.

				BROWN
		They don't see it.

				DISRAELI
		See what?

				BROWN
		The threat.
			(beat)
		I tell them, but they don't see it.

				DISRAELI
		They aren't as watchful as you.

				BROWN
		Too busy looking after themselves.

				DISRAELI
		The greasy pole.

				BROWN
		No loyalty.

				DISRAELI
		No love.

	Silence.  For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone
	else has said that.

				BROWN
		I promised to protect her from people
		like you.

				DISRAELI
		For once in my life, I am not the
		issue.

				BROWN
		She'll never understand it.

				DISRAELI
		In time, she will.

				BROWN
		She'll think I betrayed her.

				DISRAELI
		But others will know that you acted
		for the greater good.

	BROWN stares off into the distance.

	EXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY

	The next day.

	BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES
	wait on the shore.

	VICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the
	surface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them
	carefully through the water.  

				VICTORIA
		I received a letter today from Mr
		Disraeli.  Parliament is calling for
		my return to public duties.
			(beat)
		Why won't they let us be?

	BROWN does not answer.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		He insists that the country expects me
		to preside over the opening of the new
		session.  I refuse to offer sustenance
		to enable his weakening grip. 
		Besides, you know how much I should
		hate it.  It frightens me.

	She notices that BROWN has said nothing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		John?

	BROWN does not look at her.  Finally:

				BROWN
		We can't always have what we wish.

	VICTORIA stares at him.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Later that day.

	VICTORIA and BROWN are in the middle of a blazing row in
	front of the entire Household, including PONSONBY, JENNER
	and LADY ELY.

				VICTORIA
		Duty?!  You talk about duty?!

				BROWN
		If duty and safety are served by the
		same end then, aye, I do.

				VICTORIA
		I cannot believe you are saying this? 
		You, who I have relied on all this
		time --

				BROWN
			(cutting in)
		Have I ever let you down before--?

				VICTORIA
			(as if he had not spoken)
		-- You stand there and tell me it is
		my duty ... after all you promised me!

				BROWN
		I'm breaking no promises!

				VICTORIA
		You are forcing me to do the very
		thing you know I fear most!

				BROWN
		For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying
		to keep you safe!

				VICTORIA
		I will not hear any more about my
		safety!!  You made me a promise and
		now you have broken it!

	BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.

				BROWN
		-- When I took you out riding, come
		rain or shine, because I knew it was
		right for you, when I kept the bairns
		off your back so you could have a bit
		of peace, when I saw you safe from
		home to home and you didn't even know
		I was there...!  All I've ever thought
		about is you!

				VICTORIA
		Then why send me back to them?!

				BROWN
		Because I have to!
			(pause
		Will you no listen to me, woman?

	Face turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.

				VICTORIA
		Do not presume to talk to your Queen
		in that manner.

	A long silence.  BROWN watches her, but she will not look
	at him again.  Finally, she walks very slowly across the
	room.  She turns in the doorway, her voice faltering
	slightly.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell.  I shall
		retire to my chamber.  Please attend
		me presently.

	As the door slams, we ...

						FADE TO BLACK.

						FADE IN:

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, DINING ROOM - DAY

	A few weeks later.

	Close on a door as it opens.  The ROYAL FAMILY are eating
	lunch with members of the UPPER HOUSEHOLD.  VICTORIA walks
	in with LADY ELY.

	A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks
	and stands.  Clearly, they were not expecting her.  In
	silence, VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head
	of the table.

	At last, PONSONBY leans forward deferentially.

				PONSONBY
		May I say, how glad I am to see Your
		Majesty so much recovered.

	VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. 
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. 
	VICTORIA frowns.

				VICTORIA
		Where is my son?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Why is he not here?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		He is sick, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Then why are you not with him?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		You ordered all members of the Royal
		Family to attend you at Balmoral.

				VICTORIA
		What is the matter with him?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

	VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.

				VICTORIA
		No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert,
		my husband, had typhoid fever.  I
		asked what was wrong with my son.

				JENNER
		The same, your Majesty.

	VICTORIA stops.  She stares down the length of the table. 
	A long pause.

				VICTORIA
		Why was I not informed?

				JENNER
		I did not consider it wise, in the
		circumstances, to tax your nerves.

				VICTORIA
		How ill is he?

	No answer.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
			(to Alexandra)
		Alex?

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		He is not well, ma'am.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I must go to him.

	Suddenly, VICTORIA stands.  Chairs bang back as everyone
	leaps to their feet.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		We must leave at once.

	Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts
	into activity.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the
	servants and Householders hurrying about in every
	direction.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage
	amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders
	rushing to be ready in time.

	Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles
	out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time 
	- yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and
	take her place.  She ignores him completely.

	BROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother
	ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a
	second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's
	obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. 
	BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races
	away under him.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	Some days later.  A tableau.

	QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch
	surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY.  They watch DOCTOR JENNER
	bend to examine the ghostly figure of BERTIE.  He listens
	for a pulse.  Finally, he looks up.

				JENNER
		Better.

	VICTORIA lets out a deep breath.  She takes hold of
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.

				VICTORIA
		Should the good Lord see fit to spare
		my son, I will order a mass to be
		celebrated at St. George's.  The
		people must share with their Queen,
		her prayers and hopes for their future
		King.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the
	door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him
	with PONSONBY at her side.

				PONSONBY
			(aside to BROWN)
		The Queen will be riding to St.
		George's on the fifth.

				BROWN
			(launching straight in)
		I recommend Her Majesty uses the
		covered carriage with a full Horse
		Guard.  In the event of any
		disturbance I will ensure --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in)
		I will ride to St. George's in an open
		carriage.  It is time the Queen was
		seen by her public.

	VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed
	by PONSONBY.  We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and
	closer until ...

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

	Some weeks later.

	A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of
	onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding
	the cathedral.  All the time, his eyes flick left and
	right, searching the faces in front of him for potential
	assassins.  Over his intense watchfulness we hear ...

				DEAN WELLSELLY (O.S.)
		... praise and magnify thy glorious
		name for that thou has raised thy
		servant Albert Edward, Prince of Wales
		from the bed of sickness. 
		We pray thee to perfect the recovery
		of thy servant and to crown him day by
		day with more abundant blessings both
		for body and soul, through Jesus
		Christ our Lord ...

	The CONGREGATION mutters a vast ...

				CONGREGATION (O.S.)
		Amen.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

	VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down
	the steps towards the cheering crowd.  As DEAN WELLSELLY
	and BROWN follow, BROWN sees ARTHUR O'CONNER break from the
	onlookers, pulling out a gun.  BROWN yells out:

				BROWN
		NO!!

	He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to
	the ground and twists the gun out of his hand.  As they
	fall we hear laughter and:

				BERTIE (O.S.)
		So there he is, Arthur O'Conner...

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, DINING HALL - NIGHT

	It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private
	dinner party.  They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY.  BROWN is in
	attendance.  He stands off to one side, near the door.

				BERTIE
			(bristling with confidence)
		... all seven stone of the man,
		paddling madly towards us through a
		sea of Horse Guards, waving something
		that looks vaguely like a pen.  I
		thought he must be one of the mother's
		ardent readership in search of the
		Royal indenture...

	More chortling.  VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly. 
	BROWN looks straight ahead.

				BERTIE (CONT'D)
		I believe I saw him first and then
		alerted Brown.  I'm not convinced that
		he wasn't taking a snooze on top of
		the box.  Anyway, we had our man
		pinned down and I must say, Brown
		acquitted himself admirably.  Of
		course the gun was a fake, but all the
		same, it was well done.

	No-one registers BROWN.  But while VICTORIA does not look
	at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.

				VICTORIA
		I intend Brown to be rewarded with a
		special medal cast in gold.  It will
		be called The Devoted Service Medal.

	The guests applaud politely.  BERTIE clinks his glass for
	attention and raises it high.

				BERTIE
		A toast.  Victoria Regina!

	The others raise their glasses in unison.

				EVERYONE
		Victoria Regina!

	VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN remains alone by the door.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		The people of England have expressed
		in a manner which cannot be mistaken,
		that they will uphold the ancient
		monarchy of England ...

	INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

	DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of
	Tory delegates.

				DISRAELI
		... If the first great object of the
		Tory Party is to maintain the
		institutions of the country, the
		second is, in my opinion, to maintain
		the Empire of England ... the
		hereditary, the traditionary policy of
		the Tory Party.  Go to your homes,
		teach them these truths, which will
		soon be imprinted on the conscience of
		the land ...

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1883"

						FADE IN:

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The sound of rain driven hard against a window.  We creep
	slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty
	year-old BROWN.  With his whiskey for company, he is
	sitting at his desk, writing in the diary.

	The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but
	there remain a few blank pages.  Slowly, he fills them in.

				BROWN (V.O.)
		We should not live in expectation of
		contentment.  Fifteen years of
		vigilance will not guarantee peace of
		mind.  Yesterday, intruders were again
		reported in the South Wing.  I believe
		my prompt arrival may have averted any
		crisis, but it was a timely reminder. 
		It is a great comfort to me that my
		efforts in securing the Queen's safety
		over the years have not been in vain. 
		Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word
		that she's dissatisfied.  And I feel
		sure that if she were unhappy she
		would have found the occasion  to
		speak to me in person, as she has so
		often done in the past.

	A knock at the door.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		What is it?

	We hear a young PAGE, breathless from running.

				PAGE
		North woods, sir.

	BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

	BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm.  He
	walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his
	hair and clothes.

	Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm.

	A coin flips through the air to be caught by an
	outstretched hand.  The second GUARD grins.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT

	BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	And now we are back with the opening sequence.  Truncated,
	severe, and shot from a slightly different angle.  The
	driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack
	to his left, he spins and plunges on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for
	air.  He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
	length.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.

	Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly
	swaying trees.  A branch snaps behind him.  He spins round,
	bellows deep from his heart:

				BROWN
		God save the Queen!!

	And fires.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A few days later.

	VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY
	ELY.  They arrive at a door.  VICTORIA stands facing it.

				VICTORIA
			(quietly)
		How long has he been this sick?

				LADY ELY
		A few days, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Why was I not told earlier?

	LADY ELY doesn't answer.  VICTORIA knows anyway.  She nods. 
	LADY ELY knocks.  The door is opened by a young UNDER
	SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here
	in the servant's quarters.  VICTORIA walks in.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of
	the life here shocks her deeply.  The cheap furniture, the
	anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.

	He is lying in bed, barely conscious.  After a moment, he
	opens his eyes and stares at her.  She steps forward,
	smiling nervously.

	Her voice is the old voice, between friends.

				VICTORIA
		You should never have gone out in such
		foul weather.

				BROWN
		Someone has to look after you.
			(pause)
		It could've been someone.  It was
		before.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.  Yes it was.

	He cannot speak.  It's difficult for her too, but she
	speaks for him.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		My Ministers are as impertinent as
		ever.  Dispatches are now so numerous,
		they come in a trunk.  Sometimes I do
		believe they will never stop.  Endless
		letters...
		 

	Her voice falters.  A pause

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I know I have not always been the
		loyal friend you deserved, John.  And
		yet here I am now, even now, feeling
		desperate at the thought of losing
		you.

	She starts to cry.

				BROWN
		Don't be silly, woman.

	His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
	herself together.  Seeing a bowl of water on the side
	table, she steps across.  Carefully folding a cloth in
	four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. 
	Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN
	gestures protectively.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Not too near.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	A week later.  PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window
	overlooking the grounds.

				JENNER
		Erysipelas.

				PONSONBY
		Not too protracted, I hope.

				JENNER
			(shakes his head)
		A few days...
			(beat)
		When he heard, the Prince of Wales
		threw the bust from the window of the
		Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to
		gather the fragments.

	A beat.

				PONSONBY
		The Queen wishes to publish an account
		of him.

				JENNER
		Dear oh dear.

				PONSONBY
		We think she can be dissuaded.
			(beat)
		Have you had a glance at the diary?

				JENNER
		Yes.

				PONSONBY
		Quite.
			(beat)
		I think I'd best take it back.

				JENNER
		Of course.

	He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it
	over to PONSONBY.  The two men move away from the window,
	to go their separate ways.  Daily business beckons.

				JENNER (CONT'D)
		Where did you find it by the way?

				PONSONBY
		Some young page was boasting about
		having seen it.
			(beat)
		Lucky.

	JENNER nods.

				JENNER
		Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.

				PONSONBY
		No, indeed.

	The two men head off in opposite directions down the
	corridor.

          1 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - PREDAWN 1

           ELLIS(14) sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed. He is a
           wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip
           struggling desperately to be a mustache.
           His room, cluttered with junk, is dark, quiet and tiny. A
           backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him.
           The silence is cut by a SQUAWK from the Walkie. Ellis
           quickly grabs it.

                          ELLIS
           I'm comin' out now.

           He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his
           shoulder. On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot
           of his bed. He's out in one motion.

          2 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - PREDAWN 2

           Ellis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room on a two-
           foot-wide section of decking.
           He lives on a HOUSEBOAT anchored just off the bank of the
           Arkansas River. The "boat" is really the combination of a
           double wide trailer and a vinyl-sided shack fused together
           atop large flotilla.
           Ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat. He
           slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a lighted
           window. VOICES come from inside.
           Slowly, Ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window.

          3 INT. ELLIS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 3

           MARY LEE(41) takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator.
           SENIOR(52) sits at a small table reading a newspaper. The
           mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis' room.

                          MARY LEE
           I just want to have a conversation.
           I just want to talk about it.

           Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up
           from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger
           toward him.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           If you don't look up from that
           goddamn paper...

           She stops before completing the thought.
           After a moment, Senior lowers his paper. He stares across
           the table at his wife. He looks at her with true disdain.

           2.

                         
           His eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling
           on his cup of coffee. He picks up the cup, takes a sip, and
           sets it back on the table. He raises the paper up.
           Mary Lee's eyes soften. She bites the inside of her cheek to
           keep from crying. Her eyes move to the kitchen window.

          4 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 4

           Ellis quickly ducks and mouths the word "shit."
           He slips under the window toward a metal carport that covers
           a boat, fish cleaning station, and industrial ice machine.
           The entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick
           ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla. The ropes
           extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees.
           Ellis sprints across a simple, wood-planked bridge to shore.
           His houseboat is one of several in a row along the riverbank.

          5 EXT. ELLIS' RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 5

           Ellis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt path.
           Waiting for him there is NECKBONE(14), a scrawny kid with
           slicked back blonde hair wearing a FUGAZI T-shirt. He sits
           atop a smallish dirt bike. Ellis hops on the back.

                          NECKBONE
           What the shit man?

                          ELLIS
           Suck it. Drive.
           The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail.

          6 EXT. RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 6

           From a distance, the single headlight of the dirt bike snakes
           up and down, in and out of trees along the riverbank.

           ON THE BIKE,
           The sound of the engine rips through fog and trees
           illuminated by the straining headlight.

          7 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAWN 7

           The boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill. Now on
           foot, they are silhouetted against a light blue, morning sky.

                          NECKBONE
           How old is she?

                          ELLIS
           A Junior.

           3.

                         
           At a collection of trees growing out of the water, the boys
           move branches away from a tarp covered boat.

                          NECKBONE
           She's got nice titties. You talk
           to her?

                          ELLIS
           Nah.

                          NECKBONE
           You're gonna have to talk to her.

                          ELLIS
           I know.

                          NECKBONE
           Remind me when we get back to my
           house, Galen's got a book on that.
           Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom
           boat. Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat,
           launches them out into the water.

          8 EXT. RIVER - MORNING 8

           A chunk of Neckbone's greased back hair bobs in the wind as
           they cruise down river. Ellis steers a small 15 horsepower
           motor. An orange sun is coming up now.
           Neckbone's eyes lock on what's in front of them. Ellis kills
           the motor. Neckbone stands up, a serious look on his face.

                          NECKBONE
           Shit.
           Ellis raises up behind him. He takes a deep breath, nods.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Your dad'd kill us he knew we went
           out there.

                          ELLIS
           I'm not worried about my dad
           killin' us.
           THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them. It's
           enormous.
           Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river
           by comparison. The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown
           water and yellow foam six football fields wide.

                          NECKBONE
           What if it sinks?

           4.

                         

                          ELLIS
           It ain't gonna sink. We gotta move
           if we're gonna make it back. Set
           your watch. We'll need a good
           fifteen minutes.
           Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch. They
           take their seats. Ellis cranks the motor.
           The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river.

          9 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MORNING 9

           The boat lurches through the murky, rushing water.
           Neckbone has both hands firmly planted on the boat's edges.
           Ellis tries to handle the motor which has little impact
           against this current.
           The tail end of the boat swings to the right. Ellis flinches
           and grabs an edge to steady himself. The front of the boat
           bobs toward an ISLAND in the middle of the river.
           Neck turns to Ellis and points.

                          NECKBONE

           THERE IT IS!

          10 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 10

           The boys splash down in ankle deep water. They take hold of
           the front of the boat and drag it onto the muddy shore.
           Neckbone jogs to a tree line in the center of the island.
           Ellis snatches up his backpack and follows.

          11 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - CONTINUOUS 11

           The island, only 60 some yards in diameter, is separated by a
           clump of tall trees that form a wooded area in its center.
           The trees make it so you can't see from one side of the
           island to the other.

                          NECKBONE
           Galen thinks it's been here awhile.
           Thinks the last flood did it.
           Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees. They stop
           at a deep creek that cuts across the island. Neckbone looks
           to his right, then his left. Sees what he's looking for.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           It's down there.
           A fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek. Ellis starts
           across.

           5.

                         

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Hold it.
           Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Look.
           Eight feet below the tree trunk, a nest of water moccasins
           curl around in the creek. Neckbone drops the stone on top of
           them. The snakes fan out.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Little shits.
           Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk.

          12 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - DAY 12

           The boys stop near the base of a large tree and stare up.
           Ellis cranes his neck back. Awestruck.

                          NECKBONE
           So there it is.

                          ELLIS
           Yeah, there it is.
           A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above.

          13 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - MOMENTS LATER 13

           The boys scale up the tree from low lying branches.
           Ellis, hands on the edge of the boat, gets a leg over the
           side and pulls himself onto the deck. He reaches down and
           helps to drag Neckbone on board.
           They get to their feet, steadying themselves on the wooden
           deck. It's solid. They take in their new vantage point.

                          ELLIS
           It came down from up there.
           Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off.
           Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head
           over. He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood.

                          NECKBONE
           Motor broke off.
           Ellis isn't concerned with the motor. His eyes are locked on
           a covered cabin at the front of the boat.

                          ELLIS
           Who else knows about this?

           6.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           Just me and Galen.

                          ELLIS
           What's he think?

                          NECKBONE
           He don't care about it.

                          ELLIS
           Good.
           Ellis walks to the cabin. He pushes a vinyl door open.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           'Cause this boat's ours.
           Ellis has to duck down to go inside. Neckbone follows.

          14 INT. BOAT CABIN - CONTINUOUS 14

           Ellis, stooping over, makes his way into the tiny cabin room.
           Yellow floral curtains, stained with age, cover a row of
           windows that wrap around the top of the cabin. These provide
           an odd glow in an otherwise dark, wood paneled space.
           There is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left. To
           the right, a mold-covered sink and mirror.
           Neckbone peers over Ellis' shoulder at the front of the cabin
           room. A small booth sits to the right across from a
           miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door.

                          NECKBONE
           It's got its own shitbox
           Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light
           streams in. He starts opening small closets and drawers.
           Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions.

                          ELLIS
           This is perfect.

                          NECKBONE
           Ho-Lee-Shit.
           Neckbone stares in an open drawer. He removes a stack of
           Playboys from the 1980's.
           Ellis smiles at him. He leans back and props his foot
           against the sink cabinet across from him. This is home.
           Neckbone opens the first Playboy. It disintegrates.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Aw shit.

           7.

                         
          As he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a
          dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot. He lowers his shoe from
          the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own.
          He leans in to examine the larger print. The impression of a
          CROSS has been left in the heel.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Her tits are so small.
          Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the
          cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin.
          On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty
          cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag.
          Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it.

                          ELLIS
           Neck.

                          NECKBONE
           Look at that beave. You gotta see
           this.
          Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag. His fingers pull back
          the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie
          Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD.

                          ELLIS
           Neck.
          Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's
          FRESH. Ellis freezes.

                          NECKBONE
           What?

                          ELLIS
           Someone's here.

                          NECKBONE
           What?
          Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone.

                          ELLIS
           Someone's livin' here.
          Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are
          stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence.

          BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
          Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds. Neckbone's hand flies
          to cover the alarm on his wristwatch.

           8.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           Shit.

                          ELLIS
           We gotta go. I can't be late.

          15 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - MOMENTS LATER 15

           They drop out of the tree and hit the ground running.

          16 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - MOMENTS LATER 16

           The boys' feet rush across the tree trunk bridging the creek.

          17 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 17

           They launch out of the treeline and sprint to their boat.
           Neckbone grabs the side and starts pushing the boat to the
           water. Ellis slings his backpack in and joins him.
           Suddenly, Ellis straightens up, leaving Neckbone to struggle.

                          NECKBONE
           What are you doing?
           Ellis stares at a muddy boot print, cross in the heel,
           stamped in the center of their boat. He looks back to the
           treeline, then down the shore. He looks to his feet.
           The boys' shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud.
           Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           What is it?

                          ELLIS

                          (POINTING)
           I saw that same boot print up in
           the tree. It has a cross in the
           heel. Somebody's been in our boat.

                          NECKBONE
           Shit. Let's go.
           Ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           We gotta go if you wanna make it
           back.

                          (NO RESPONSE)
           Your dad's gonna kick our ass.
           It'll take twice as long goin' up
           river.

                          ELLIS
           Hold it.

           9.

                         
          Ellis stops and points ahead of them.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           Up there. They stop.
          Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print.
          They appear to vanish.

                          NECKBONE
           Where the hell'd he go?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know.
          Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the
          distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their
          boat.
          Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He
          flinches at the sight of the Man.
          MUD(38) stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's
          fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back
          at them and casts his fishing line into the water.

                          NECKBONE
           Shit. You know that guy?

                          ELLIS
           I've never seen him before.

                          NECKBONE
           Shit.
          Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his
          line. His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of
          growth on his face.
          With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a
          MISSING CANINE. He holds a hand in the air as if to wave.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Shit.
          Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back. Mud wears
          jeans and cowboy boots. His filthy button-up shirt looks
          like it hasn't left his body in years.
          He breaks his stare with the boys. Continuing to reel in his
          line, he walks over to them.

                          MUD
           What you say?
          The boys don't respond. Mud walks past them and casts again.

           10.

                         

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Helluva thing.

                          ELLIS
           What's that?
          Mud takes the cigarette from his mouth. A tattoo of a
          snake's head covers the top of his right hand. Two large
          cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws.

                          MUD
           Boat in the trees. It's a helluva
           thing.
          Mud continues walking down the shoreline, reeling in his
          bait. The boys follow, tentatively.

                          ELLIS
           You talkin' 'bout our boat?

                          MUD
           I'm talkin' about my boat.

                          NECKBONE
           We found it.

                          MUD
           You found it with me livin' in it.
           Possession is nine tenths of the
           law.

                          NECKBONE
           So?

                          MUD
           Don't tell me you boys are from
           Mississippi?

                          ELLIS
           No.
          They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and
          spits on it. Then, tucking the pole under his arm, he ties a
          lock of his hair into a knot. He finishes this process with
          another cast.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           You got crosses in your heels.

                          MUD
           Nails. Shaped liked crosses.

                          ELLIS
           What for?

           11.

                         

                          MUD
           Ward off evil spirits. A man I
           called an Indian but was Meskin
           said they were Seven-league boots
           worn by the seventh son of a
           seventh son. Told me it'd turn me
           into a werewolf but that's a lie.
           I don't know nothin' about that.
          Ellis, confused, won't take his eyes off the man.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           They just good luck, but so far
           they ain't been workin' too well.
           (missing tooth smile)
           What's your name?
          Mud seems easy to smile, which softens his otherwise coarse
          look. His words spill from the mouth rapidly, without much
          thought for punctuation. Neckbone, emboldened by these
          facts, steps forward to answer.

                          NECKBONE
           I'm Neckbone, he's Ellis, and
           mister you may be stone ass crazy
           but I know you're not the owner of
           that boat, not for nine tenths of
           nothin'.

                          MUD
           Neckbone? That's a real handle
           son. Where ya'll from?

                          NECKBONE
           What do you care where we're from?

                          ELLIS
           DeWitt.
          Neckbone looks at Ellis, frustrated by his friend.

                          MUD
           Arkansas boys. Ya'll had me
           worried for a second.
          Mud, pleased by this news, tucks the fishing pole under his
          arm and holds out a hand to shake. Ellis stares at the hand,
          unsure. He takes it reluctantly.

                          ELLIS
           We s'posed to know you?

                          MUD
           I doubt it. I grew up `round here,
           but I've been gone awhile.

           12.

                         

                          ELLIS
           Where around here?

                          MUD
           Different places. Spent a lot of
           time back up near the White.

                          ELLIS
           You know Shelly's Oxbow?
          Neckbone can't believe his friend is offering this up.

                          NECKBONE
           Ellis. We gotta go.

                          MUD
           I know it. Guy named Tom
           Blankenship used to live back in
           there.

                          ELLIS
           He still does. His boat's cross
           from mine.
          Mud smiles.

                          MUD
           Ain't that somethin'.
          In one motion, Mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a pack
          out of his shirt pocket.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I like you two. You remind me of
           me. And seeing how you boys are
           from Arkansas and we know some
           people and sounds like we all from
           the same place I'd say we can make
           a deal here about somethin'.

                          ELLIS
           A deal for what?

                          MUD
           Food. Food for a boat.

                          NECKBONE
           This guy's a bum Ellis. Come on.
          Mud's smile vanishes. Neckbone begins to walk off but
          begrudgingly stops when Ellis starts back in.

                          ELLIS
           Why don't you go get your own food?

           13.

                         

                          MUD
           I would if I could, but I told
           somebody I'd meet `em here. So I'm
           stuck for now and what I got's
           runnin' low.
           Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm.

                          NECKBONE
           He's a bum Ellis, let's go.
           Mud lays a serious look down on Neckbone.

                          MUD
           I'm no bum. I got money. You can
           call me a hobo `cause a hobo'll
           work for his living and you can
           call me homeless `cause that's true
           for now, but if you call me a bum
           again I'll have to teach you
           somethin' about respect that your
           daddy never did.
           Neckbone's confidence recedes. Ellis stands his ground.

                          ELLIS
           When they show up, you'll leave?
           Mud begins fishing again.

                          MUD
           Yeah.

                          ELLIS
           And when you leave, that boat's
           ours?

                          MUD
           Yeah.
           Ellis studies Mud's face, clothes, tattoos. He's thinking
           about it. Mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I'm in a tight spot. I just need a
           little help.

                          ELLIS
           We gotta go.
           With that, Ellis turns to leave. The boys walk briskly back
           to their boat. Ellis looks over his shoulder to see Mud
           making another cast with his fishing pole.

          18 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MOMENTS LATER 18

           Ellis motors them away from the island.

           14.

                         

                          ELLIS
           You get his name?!

                          NECKBONE
           No!
           Ellis looks back. Mud has disappeared.

          19 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DAY 19

           Senior heaves an enormous, white cooler into the bed of his
           weathered pick-up truck.
           The truck is parked at an angle on a concrete boat ramp next
           to their houseboat. The bed of the truck is jam-packed with
           six of the big, white coolers.
           The SOUND of a dirt bike rattles through the trees. Senior
           looks up, wiping his brow with a handkerchief.
           Ellis leaps out of the treeline and runs to the pick-up. His
           hands hit his knees, out of breath.

                          ELLIS
           I'm sorry.

                          SENIOR
           Where you been?

                          ELLIS
           Neck and I got caught up helpin'
           Galen.

                          SENIOR
           You're s'posed to be helpin' me. I
           had to load this myself.

                          ELLIS
           I know, I'm sorry.

                          SENIOR
           Just get in the back. Can't be
           later than we are.

                          ELLIS
           Yessir.
           Senior flips up the tailgate. Ellis hops up the wheel well
           and into the bed of the truck. He steadies himself on one of
           the coolers as his father pulls away.

           front door of a house. An elderly black man waits there.

          21 EXT. SONIC DRIVE-IN - DAY 21

           Ellis sits in the bed of the truck eating a chili dog.
           Senior is up front wolfing down a cheeseburger.
           A GROUP of TEENAGERS are gathered around a CLUSTER of parked
           cars in the corner of the lot. They meander between the
           vehicles, smoking, gossiping, passing around a bottle of
           Boone's Farm. Ellis watches them.
           MAY PEARL(16) appears in the middle of the Group laughing
           with her GIRLFRIENDS. She's pretty and physically more
           mature looking than Ellis.
           He watches as a SKINNY KID takes his ballcap off and puts it
           on May Pearl's head. She sniffs the cap, gags and tosses it
           back at him. Her friends laugh.

                          SENIOR
           Let's go son.
           Ellis crumples the wrapper to his finished hotdog and jumps
           down from the bed of the truck.

          22 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/TWO-LANE ROAD - MOVING - DAY 22
           Ellis rides up front with his father.
           Senior is a reserved man, older than Ellis' mother by several
           years. He's got thinning hair under the cap that only leaves
           his head when he sleeps.
           He reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a fold of
           cash. He slips out a five dollar bill and hands it to Ellis.

                          ELLIS
           It's s'posed to be ten.

           16.

                         

                          SENIOR
           It's ten you do your share. I
           loaded this mornin'. That makes it
           five.
           Ellis begrudgingly stuffs the five in his jeans.

                          ELLIS
           You drop me at Neck's?
           Senior checks his pants pockets, feels around under his seat.

                          SENIOR
           Hadn't you seen enougha him today?

                          ELLIS
           Said he had something for me.

                          SENIOR
           You see anymore Ding Dongs over
           there?
           Ellis checks under his seat and pulls out a half-empty box of
           Ding Dongs. Hands one over to his father who rips the
           package with his teeth.

                          ELLIS
           What'd Momma wanna talk to you
           about?

                          SENIOR
           What?

                          ELLIS
           This mornin', what'd she wanna talk
           with you about?

                          SENIOR
           You spy on me in my own house?

                          ELLIS
           I wasn't spyin', just heard ya'll.

                          SENIOR
           That's your mother's business.
           Senior makes this his answer, eats the Ding Dong.

          23 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - DAY 23

           Neckbone sits on the front steps of his trailer reading a
           comic book. The muffled sound of the Beach Boys' "Help Me
           Rhonda" plays off a record inside.
           Senior's truck pulls away as Ellis walks up the entrance to
           the trailer park.

           17.

                         

                          ELLIS
           I came by for that book.

                          NECKBONE
           What book?

                          ELLIS
           You said Galen had a book might
           help me out.

                          NECKBONE
           Aw, yeah. We gotta give it a
           minute. You hear that music?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          NECKBONE
           That means he's doin' it. That's
           his doin' it song.
          Ellis takes a seat next to Neckbone. They listen to the
          song, slightly craning their necks to pick up on any other
          sounds. There are none.

                          ELLIS
           You know who it is?

                          NECKBONE
           Whoever's drivin' that white Dodge.
          Neckbone motions to a beat up Dodge Shadow in the yard.

                          ELLIS
           You tell Galen 'bout this morning?

                          NECKBONE
           Nah. You tell anybody?

                          ELLIS
           No.

                          NECKBONE
           That guy was crazy.

                          ELLIS
           Maybe. I don't know. I think he
           just needed some help.

                          NECKBONE
           Well he can swim his ass off that
           island and get some.

                          ELLIS
           I think I'm gonna go back, take him
           some food.

           18.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           Why?
          Suddenly, the music from inside stops. Footsteps approaching
          and the trailer door flies open, almost hitting the boys.
          A GIRL(28) bursts out down the steps, straight to her car.
          She wears tight jean-shorts and is buttoning a white shirt.
          She stops and turns back to the boys.

                          GIRL
           You're Neckbone right?

                          NECKBONE
           Yeah.

                          GIRL
           You look like a good enough kid. A
           word of advice, don't grow up to be
           like your shit heel uncle.
          The boys can't take their eyes off her cleavage revealed
          under her half-buttoned shirt. A necklace with three
          misshapen pearls hangs from her neck.

                          GIRL (CONT'D)
           Hey!
          She snaps the boys' attention up to her eyes.

                          GIRL (CONT'D)
           You hear me? You treat a woman
           like a princess. Got it?!

                          NECKBONE
           Yeah.
          The trailer door opens and GALEN(36) emerges. He's a big,
          lumbering guy wearing a full-body wet suit pulled halfway
          down. A faded mermaid tattooed in the middle of his chest.

                          GALEN
           Come on baby.

                          GIRL

           I'M A GODDAMN PRINCESS!!!
          The Girl yanks off the necklace and hurls it at Galen. He
          brushes fingers through his thick mustache.

                          GALEN
           That's uncalled for.
          He walks out to her. She heads for the Dodge Shadow.

           19.

                         

                          GALEN (CONT'D)

                          (TRAILING OFF)
           A lot of people are comfortable
           with that kind of thing in the
           bedroom. Some people aren't. We
           know that about you now...
           Ellis sees one of the misshapen pearls at his feet. He picks
           it up and holds it to the sun.

                          NECKBONE
           Pearls. Galen finds 'em in some of
           the mussel shells. Most of 'em
           ain't worth dick, but he likes to
           make necklaces for the girls. Come
           on, let's get that book.
           Neckbone walks into the trailer. Ellis stands up and
           retrieves the other two pearls out of the dirt. He crams
           them in his pocket and follows Neckbone inside.

          24 INT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS 24

           The trailer is decorated in the filth of a true bachelor pad.
           Neckbone makes his way to a bedroom. He tosses clothes and
           trash around to get to what he's looking for. A cardboard
           box. He pulls the box onto the bed and sifts through.

                          NECKBONE
           I don't want you goin' back out
           there by yourself. That river's
           scary enough with two people, and I
           don't trust that guy.

                          (FINDS SOMETHING)
           Here it is.
           He takes out a hardback book. The slip reads, "The Confident
           Confidant, communicating with the opposite sex."

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Galen said this really turned
           things around for him.

                          ELLIS
           Thanks.
           Ellis flips delicately through the manual.

          25 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS 25

           Galen watches as the Girl's Dodge Shadow pulls away. The
           boys step out of the trailer.

                          NECKBONE
           You really going back out there?

           20.

                         

                          ELLIS
           I think it's the right thing to do.

                          NECKBONE
           Well...I'll be over in the mornin'
           then.
           Galen, his thumbs tucked under his armpits, walks back to the
           trailer. He passes the boys and notices the self-help book
           in Ellis' hands.

                          GALEN

                          (WITHOUT STOPPING)
           That's a good book. Be sure you do
           the worksheets in the back. Let's
           get some dinner Neck.
           Galen's gone inside.

                          NECKBONE
           I'll call 'fore I come.

                          ELLIS
           All right.
           Neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer. Ellis flips
           through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park.

          26 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 26

           By the time Ellis makes it to his houseboat, the sun has
           disappeared behind the horizon.
           He crosses the make-shift plank and enters through a screen
           door by the carport.

          27 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 27

           Mary Lee flinches when she sees Ellis come through the door.
           Her face is flushed. Senior stands toe to toe with her.
           They stare at Ellis, who has paused in the doorway. He
           doesn't say anything, just looks curiously at his parents.
           Senior storms past Ellis and is out the door.
           Ellis steps further into the den. Mary Lee tries to
           straighten herself, patting down her hair and dabbing at her
           eyes with the back of her hand.

                          ELLIS
           You okay momma?

                          MARY LEE
           Yes.

           21.

                         
           She walks into the kitchen keeping Ellis at her back. She
           turns on the sink and begins scrubbing at a dish.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           Do you need me to fix you
           somethin'? Have you eaten?

                          ELLIS
           I'm all right.
           Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the
           sink. She turns to Ellis.

                          MARY LEE
           I'm gonna turn in.

                          ELLIS
           Okay momma.
           Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom. The door
           closes and Ellis is left alone in the den. It's quiet. He
           waits, looking at the door his mother just closed.
           Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door.
           Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and
           fills it with CANNED FOOD.

          28 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - DAY 28

           Hands pump the stock of a high-powered pellet gun.
           TOM BLANKENSHIP(67), white hair cut high and tight wearing a
           short-sleeve button up, takes careful aim with the pellet
           gun.
           Tom sits in a lawn chair atop the roof of his houseboat. He
           squeezes his left eye shut.
           A snake's head pokes out of the water about 15 yards off his
           boat. The head makes for a target no bigger than a thumb.
           Tom's left eye snaps open and he fires. The pellet rips
           through the snake's head. Its body floats to the surface.
           Tom takes account of his shot as he pumps the air rifle. He
           scans the water for more targets.

          29 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 29

           Ellis watches Tom Blankenship from across the bayou. Tom's
           boat sits directly opposite Ellis', separated by 30 yards of
           muddy brown water.
           Ellis leans against a post under the carport. His backpack
           resting at his feet, he holds the Walkie-Talkie in his hand.
           Senior works behind him washing utensils in the outdoor sink.

           22.

                         

                          ELLIS
           What do you know about Tom
           Blankenship?

                          SENIOR
           What?
           Senior doesn't turn around from his work at the sink.

                          ELLIS
           Mr. Blankenship, what do you know
           about him?

                          SENIOR
           Why?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know. He looks lonely over
           there.

                          SENIOR
           Some people move to this river to
           work on it, and some move here to
           be left alone.
           Senior makes his way to the ice machine and begins scooping
           ice into a large white cooler.
           Mary Lee emerges from the houseboat dressed for work, a
           secretarial job. Senior stops what he's doing to watch her.
           She walks over to Ellis.

                          MARY LEE
           Let's sit down for dinner tonight
           okay? Will you make it home by
           seven?

                          ELLIS
           Yes ma'am.
           She walks off the boat without a glance in Senior's
           direction. He trails her with his eyes before going back to
           digging in the ice.
          A29 Ellis looks back at Tom. The Walkie SQUAWKS out several A29
           loud BEEPS. Ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the
           boat.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           Bye Dad.
           Senior holds a hand up but never looks up from his work.

           23.

                         

          30 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 30

           Water laps at the shore of the island. Ellis and Neckbone
           drag their boat onto the muddy bank.

                          NECKBONE
           Where you think he's at?

                          ELLIS
           I guess we should try the boat.
           They head for the treeline.

          31 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 31

           The boys emerge from the woods, their attention focused up to
           the boat hovering in the tree some twenty feet above them.
           Ellis notices the remnants of a fire on the ground. A log
           pushed up next to it for a seat. Ellis kicks at the ash.

                          ELLIS
           Looks like he made camp.

                          NECKBONE
           (looking up to the boat)
           You think he's up there?

           MUD (O.S.)
           I didn't know if ya'll'd come back.
           The boys spin around. They survey the woods but no one's
           there. Their eyes drift up to find Mud sitting in a tree,
           his legs dangle off a branch.

                          ELLIS
           What're you doin'?
           Mud bounds down, stepping from limb to trunk to the ground.
           It's an agile move.

                          MUD
           I try to never sleep in the same
           place twice. What you got there?
           Mud motions with his head to the backpack in Ellis' hand.
           Ellis holds it out to him.

                          ELLIS
           I brought you some food.
           Mud looks at the backpack, but doesn't move.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           Go on.

           24.

                         
          Mud takes the backpack and walks over to the ashes of his
          campfire. He squats with his back to the boys and unzips the
          bag. Hunkered down, Mud's shirttail rides up over the lip of
          his jeans revealing a PISTOL at his backside.
          Ellis sees this and motions to Neckbone. The boys stand
          their ground, cautious.

                          MUD
           I owe you boys.
          Keeping the bag in hand, Mud takes a seat on the stump behind
          him. He pulls out a selection of canned food; pumpkin pie
          filling, evaporated milk, green beans. He grabs the beans.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I was gonna try runnin' a trot line
           today. See how far that'd get me.
          Mud removes a good-sized folding knife from his pocket and
          makes short order of the can lid. He tips the can up letting
          the beans fall into his mouth. Juice flows down his cheeks.

                          MUD (CONT'D)

                          (A MOUTHFUL)
           I'd been rationin' what I
           had...green bean never tasted so
           good.
          The can is quickly emptied, juice running down Mud's chin.
          He straightens his back, choking down the final swallow. He
          sees the boys staring at him and catches himself.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I appreciate it.

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          NECKBONE
           What you got that pistol for?
          Mud wipes off his chin, realizing the boys have been studying
          him. He closes the knife and tucks it in his pocket.

                          MUD
           For protection.
          Mud gets up, heads for a duffel bag tucked under a nearby
          tree. The boys pivot, keeping Mud in front of them. Mud
          notices.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Ya'll don't have to be afraid of
           me. I have two ways to protect
           myself out here. This shirt, and
           this pistol.

           25.

                         

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           There are fierce powers at work in
           the world boys. Good, evil, poor
           luck, best luck. Men have to take
           advantage where they can.
           Mud removes a spool of fishing line and a small plastic
           tackle box. He scoops up the duffel bag and heads into the
           woods.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Ya'll comin'?
          32 Neckbone looks to Ellis, who walks after Mud into the 32
           trees.

                          ELLIS
           Who's this guy you're waitin' on?

                          MUD
           I'm not waitin' for a guy. I'm
           waitin' on my girlfriend. Juniper.

                          NECKBONE
           Is she hot?

                          MUD
           She's beautiful.

                          NECKBONE

                          (COUGHING)
           Bullshit.

                          MUD
           Best lookin' girl I've ever seen.
           Hands down. Blonde hair. Long
           legs. She's like a dream you don't
           want to wake up from. She's got
           birds tattooed on her hands, here.
           Mud stops, points to the area on the top of his right hand,
           between his thumb and pointer finger.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Nightingales. Good luck birds.

                          NECKBONE
           That a good luck snake?

                          MUD
           No it is not.

                          NECKBONE
           I hate snakes.

                          MUD
           That's because God made them for us
           to fear.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           It's a thing we knew to be afraid
           of before we even got into this
           world.
          33 They emerge from the woods onto the downstream coast of 33
           the island. It looks different than the other shoreline.
           A large swath of red clay angles sharply into the water.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Cherokee would wrap snake skin
           around their pregnant women's
           bellies. Induce labor, scare the
           child out. Here.
           He fetches a length of rope out of the duffel bag and tosses
           it to Neckbone.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Set that `round your bed at night.
           Snake won't cross braided rope.

                          NECKBONE
           Thanks.
           (nods to Mud's tattoo)
           So what's that for then?
           Mud walks to a tree branch that has grown out over the bank,
           nearly resting in the water. He sets a trot line from it.

                          MUD
           A reminder. Don't get bit. I was
           10, swimmin' `bout a mile up from
           here. Me and Juniper. Sonofabitch
           swam right up under me, bit me just
           below the armpit. June got me out,
           got me to a clinic. Doctor said I
           shoulda been dead in twenty
           minutes. Took us an hour just to
           get back to town.

                          NECKBONE
           What'd they do?

                          MUD
           Gave me antivenom. For a cotton
           mouth. See here.
           Mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand. He points out
           the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snake's mouth.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Problem with antivenom is they can
           only give it to you once. It's
           made from horse blood. Your body
           would reject it a second time. The
           cure ends up being more dangerous
           than the poison.

           27.

                         

                          ELLIS
           What happens if you get bit again?

                          MUD
           I die, or just sweat it out.
           Neckbone, not buying it, looks at Ellis and taps his watch.

                          ELLIS
           We gotta go help Neck's uncle.

                          MUD
           All right.

                          ELLIS
           You never said your name.

                          MUD
           Mud. You can call me Mud.

                          ELLIS
           Mud?

                          MUD

           M-U-D.
           Neckbone tosses the braided rope back. It lands at his feet.

                          NECKBONE
           Here you go, Mud. I think you need
           that worse than I do.

                          MUD

                          (SMILING)
           I'll be all right.
           The boys disappear back into the trees.

          34 INT. GARY'S ELECTRIC SHOP - DAY 34

           A switch clicks "ON". BLINDING LIGHT emits from two FLOOD
           LAMPS encased in plastic shells. The switch clicks "OFF" and
           the lights dim to the dull orange glow of their filaments.

                          GALEN
           They look bright enough.
           The owner of the shop, an ELECTRICIAN(62), holds up a metal
           bar with the lamps affixed by bolts at either end.

                          ELECTRICIAN
           Should be. I rigged DC power up
           through marine batteries. Makes it
           portable. Gave you a rigging bar
           to set on your shoulder.

                          GALEN
           So you really think these'll work
           under water?

                          ELECTRICIAN
           In theory.

          35 EXT. GARY'S ELECTRIC/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 35

           Ellis and Neckbone sit on the tailgate of Galen's truck. The
           Gary's Electric sign hangs behind them.
           Neckbone focuses on a carburetor in his hand. Ellis stares
           across the street at the Piggly Wiggly parking lot where the
           roving GROUP of TEENAGERS have collected for the afternoon.
           The Teenagers are up to their typical gossip and minor
           offenses. Ellis has zeroed in on May Pearl again.

                          NECKBONE
           You start datin' I bet her dad'll
           give you a free pick-up truck.

                          ELLIS
           I don't care about that.
           Ellis watches as the same Skinny Kid from before tries to
           flirt with her. She's not having it. He pops her bra strap
           before landing the final straw, a smack on her ass. She
           turns and swats at him.
           Seeing this, Ellis is on his feet and crossing the street.

                          NECKBONE
           What's goin' on?
           Ellis doesn't turn back. Neckbone reluctantly sets the
           carburetor down and follows.

          36 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 36


                          MAY PEARL
           Stop it!
           She shoves the Skinny Kid, but he continues laughing.

           ELLIS (O.S.)
           Hey.
           Ellis taps the Kid on the shoulder. As he turns, Ellis
           PUNCHES him in the face.
           The Kid, completely taken off guard, stumbles and trips to
           the ground. Some older, tougher looking GUYS see this and
           begin laughing at him.

           29.

                         

                          OLDER KID
           Holy shit Pryor, get off your ass.
          Pryor collects himself and gets off the ground. Ego bruised,
          he walks off mumbling. The Older Kids keep riding him.
          May Pearl sizes up Ellis.

                          MAY PEARL
           You didn't have to do that.

                          ELLIS
           He was messin' with you.

                          MAY PEARL
           Do I know you?

                          ELLIS
           I'm Ellis. That's Neck.
          Neckbone waves by wagging a finger in the air.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           We went to Junior High with you,
           before you went to High School.

                          MAY PEARL
           How old are you?

                          ELLIS
           Fourteen.

                          MAY PEARL
           Fourteen? You know you just
           punched a Senior?

                          ELLIS
           So?

                          MAY PEARL
           You think you're pretty tough.
          Ellis shrugs, not wanting to deny it.

           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
           I'm May Pearl.

                          ELLIS
           I know.

                          MAY PEARL
           What else do you know?

                          ELLIS
           Nothin'.
          She smiles.

           30.

                         
          Something catches Neckbone's attention. He cranes his neck
          forward to get a better look.

                          NECKBONE
           Son of a bitch...Ellis?
          Ellis breaks away from his conversation with May Pearl.

                          ELLIS
           What?

                          NECKBONE
           Look.
          Neckbone nods to a cheap motel called the EXECUTIVE INN
          located on the opposite side of the Piggly Wiggly parking
          lot.
          JUNIPER(35), a truly beautiful woman squeezed into tight
          jeans and a low cut top, makes her way from the motel parking
          lot to the Piggly Wiggly.
          She passes in front of the cluster of Teenagers. All of the
          boys have taken note. Some cat calls from the crowd.
          Juniper, without facing the Teenagers, gives them the finger.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           You ever seen that girl before?

                          ELLIS
           No. Did you see her hands?

                          MAY PEARL
           Hello?
          Ellis catches himself and turns back to May Pearl.

                          ELLIS
           Sorry. We know a guy we think
           might know that girl.

                          MAY PEARL
           Oh.
          A GIRLFRIEND(17) of May Pearl's calls out to her.

                          GIRLFRIEND
           May Pearl! Let's go!

                          MAY PEARL
           Okay!

                          ELLIS
           I guess I'll see you.

           30A.

                         

                          MAY PEARL
          If you can find my phone number,
          you should call it.

           31.

                         

                          ELLIS
           I can find it.
           May Pearl walks over to her friend. Ellis watches her go,
           but then remembers Juniper. He turns to Neckbone.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           Where'd she go?

                          NECKBONE
           Into the Piggly Wiggly. She came
           from the motel.

                          ELLIS
           I'm gonna go see if it's her.

                          NECKBONE
           I gotta go check on Galen. We'll
           pick you up out front.
           Ellis heads for the Piggly Wiggly. Neckbone calls after him.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           What'd she say?

                          ELLIS
           Wants me to call her.

                          NECKBONE
           Shit.

          37 INT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - DAY 37

           Ellis walks past the grocery aisles looking for the girl. He
           spots her by the potato chips. He tucks behind a display of
           stacked cans and watches.
           Juniper reaches for a bag of chips, birds tattooed on her
           hand. Ellis smiles. It's her, and she really is beautiful.
           She turns down the aisle, coming right for him. He pretends
           to peruse the canned food and notices that it's a big display
           of Beanie Weenie. He grabs two handfuls as she passes.
           Ellis takes the cans to an open register. As a CASHIER scans
           and bags his items, he cranes his neck looking for her.
           She's disappeared into another section of the store.
           Ellis pays in crumpled cash. A horn HONKS. He sees Galen's
           truck idling out front. He grabs the bag and runs out.

          38 EXT. GALEN'S TRUCK/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 38

           Neckbone waits at the open passenger door.

                          NECKBONE
           Was it her?

           32.

                         

                          ELLIS
           It's her. I saw the tattoos. He
           wasn't lyin'.

                          NECKBONE

                          (LOOKING BACK)
           No he wasn't.

          39 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 39

           By the time Ellis makes it back home, the sun has gone from
           the sky. He crosses the makeshift plank to board his house.

           SENIOR (O.S.)
           Home for dinner?
           Ellis is startled by his father's voice. Senior sits in a
           lawn chair under the eaves of the carport. He's hidden in
           shadow, save for a red glow from the tip of his cigarette.

                          ELLIS
           What you hidin' for?

                          SENIOR
           I ain't hidin'.
           He notices Senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his
           feet. Ellis opens the screen door leading inside.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           Come over here.
           Ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that
           supports the carport. He leans into it.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           You know I love you?

                          ELLIS
           Yessir. I know.

                          SENIOR
           I work you hard 'cause life is
           work. You know that?

                          ELLIS
           Yessir.

                          SENIOR
           Your Mamma's been talkin' 'bout
           movin' in town.

                          ELLIS
           What's that mean?

           33.

                         

                          SENIOR
           She seems set on it. Wants to
           separate. She may ask me for a
           divorce.
          This hits Ellis like a ton of bricks. He rights himself.

                          ELLIS
           What's that mean for me?

                          SENIOR
           It means enjoy the river son.
           Enjoy it while you live on it,
           'cause this way a life isn't long
           for this world. Game and fish's
           'bout made certain of that.

                          ELLIS
           But you and me can still live out
           here. Game and fish can't take
           your boat. Not while you're still
           in it.

                          SENIOR
           The houseboat's in your mother's
           name. Her daddy give it to her not
           me. If she wants to leave it, Game
           and Fish has ever' right to take
           this boat apart board by board.

                          ELLIS
           But that ain't right. You work
           outta here. We got the ice
           machine, the traps. What are we
           supposed to do?

                          SENIOR
           Like I said, this is your mother's
           business.

                          ELLIS
           I ain't no townie. I ain't livin'
           like that.
          Senior takes a slow pull off the bottle. Ellis' mind races.

                          SENIOR
           I've let you down. A man should be
           in charge of his own affairs, but I
           haven't worked it like that.

                          ELLIS
           But ya'll are married. Ya'll are
           s'posed to love each other.

                          SENIOR
           I don't know about that anymore.

           34.

                         
           Ellis is speechless. After a moment, he turns to go inside.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           Ellis?
           He stops and turns back to his father. Senior tries to
           express a sentiment he doesn't have the words for. Ellis
           continues inside.

          40 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 40

           Mary Lee sits hunched at the made dinner table. She runs her
           finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea.
           It's a full spread with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a
           salad. The table is set for two. She's been waiting.
           Ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him. She sits up.

                          MARY LEE
           You're late.
           Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her. He enters his
           room and shuts the door.
           He's heard the news and she knows it. Mary Lee's face drops.

          41 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41

           Ellis slings his backpack down, pacing the small room. He
           stops and leans his forehead against the door. The sound of
           his Mother clearing the table seeps through.
           He kicks the door, cracking its shitty composite wood. His
           face flushed and his breathing heavy, he slides to a seat.
           On the verge of hyperventilating, he stares out the dark
           bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing.
           Ellis looks at his backpack. It has spilled open revealing a
           can of Beanie Weenie. Ellis studies the can.
           He looks back to the window. His breathing settles.
           Quickly, he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window.

          42 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 42

           It's pitch black. The only light comes from the moon's
           reflection off the surface of the water.
           Ellis, eyes wide, navigates the small boat through choppy
           black water.

           35.

                         

          43 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 43

           Ellis struggles to pull the boat onto shore. Leaving it half
           in the water, Ellis looks around. No sign of Mud. He sizes
           up the dark woods.
           He removes a flashlight from his backpack and shines it down
           the shorelines. Still nothing. Ellis follows the beam of
           light into the woods.

          44 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - NIGHT 44

           Ellis stands at the creek that cuts through the island.
           He can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the
           distance. A RUSTLING behind him. He swings the light
           around. Nothing but trees.
           Ellis takes a deep breath. Finding the log to cross, he
           shines his light down into the creek. The nest of snakes
           show their backs.

          45 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - NIGHT 45

           A campfire burns at the base of the tree. The firelight
           illuminates the belly of the boat that rests 20 feet above.
           Ellis, his flashlight off, crouches behind a tree and watches
           the campsite. There is no one there. He looks into the
           black forest behind him, thinks of going back.
           A twig snaps in the distance and he's back on guard. Ellis
           nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into the
           light of the campfire.
           The SOUND of a gun's hammer drawing back CLICKS behind him.
           Ellis freezes.
           Mud emerges from the trees, a .45 extended toward Ellis'
           back.

                          MUD
           Ellis?
           Ellis, still frozen, slowly turns to him. Mud huffs out a
           laugh and drops the pistol to his side.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           What're you doin' out here?
           Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand.

                          ELLIS
           I got you some Beanie Weenie.
           Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack.

           36.

                         

                          MUD
           I appreciate that, but I didn't
           expect you out here at night.
          Mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into his
          own duffel bag. He holds up a can of the Beanie Weenie.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Look at that. You really know how
           to do somebody right. I didn't
           wanna say anything before, but it's
           hard to make a meal out of pumpkin
           pie filling.

                          ELLIS
           That's all my mom had.

                          MUD
           I'm not complainin'.

                          ELLIS
           Can I get one of those?

                          MUD
           They're yours to begin with.
          Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can. They eat.

                          ELLIS
           I missed my dinner.

                          MUD
           That's good right?

                          ELLIS

                          (MOUTH FULL)
           You been out here too long.
          Mud laughs. Finishing the can, he takes a half-smoked
          cigarette from his shirt pocket. He pulls a twig from the
          fire for a light.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           The girl you're waitin' on, she's
           your girlfriend?

                          MUD
           Juniper. Yeah.

                          ELLIS
           How'd you meet her?

                          MUD
           We grew up together.

                          ELLIS
           Do you love her?

           37.

                         

                          MUD
           I do. The first time I saw her was
           on this river. Just up from here.
           She saved my life.

                          ELLIS
           From the snake bite.

                          MUD
           That's right. I was younger than
           you are now, but when I came to in
           the hospital and she was there, it
           was like the world split open, came
           back together new. Everything
           changed. I knew from then on I'd
           do anything for her.

                          ELLIS
           Why aren't ya'll married?

                          MUD
           I've asked. Several times.
           Marriage just doesn't work for some
           people.
          Ellis thinks on this.

                          ELLIS
           My dad says my parents may be
           gettin' a divorce.

                          MUD
           I'm sorry to hear that.

                          ELLIS
           If it happens, and my mom moves us
           off the river, they say the
           government can come take our boat
           away.

                          MUD
           Who says that?

                          ELLIS
           Everybody. They passed a law so
           you can't sell your boat. Can't
           rent it. If the owner leaves, they
           got you. Game and Fish want `em
           off the river.

                          MUD
           I've never been one to trust the
           government on matters of personal
           property, but if your parents love
           each other, there's always a
           chance.

                          (MORE)

           38.

                         

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           People just sometimes forget why
           they fell in love in the first
           place.
          Ellis watches Mud toke the cigarette nub. He's really
          getting all he can from it.

                          ELLIS
           I saw Juniper today.

                          MUD
           What?

                          ELLIS
           I didn't talk to her, but she had
           the birds tattooed on her hand like
           you said. You were right. She's
           pretty.
          Mud stands, surprised by the news. He walks to the other
          side of the fire so his back is to the boy.

                          MUD
           Where'd you see her?

                          ELLIS
           At the Piggly Wiggly. I think
           she's stayin' at a motel by there.
           The Executive Inn.
          Mud looks at Ellis through the fire. He takes a drag and
          smiles at the boy. The hole from his missing tooth shows.

                          MUD
           That's good news. Real good news.
          Mud paces, slowly. He's thinking.

                          ELLIS
           Does she know you're out here?

                          MUD
           No. We picked another place to
           meet. Couple days from now.
          Mud walks back to the log and sits.

                          ELLIS
           You wanna go tonight? I can give
           you a ride up river.
          Mud looks at Ellis, nodding.

                          MUD
           Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow.

           39.

                         

                          ELLIS
           You need me to come get you?

                          MUD
           Naw. I can manage. Hell I got out
           here didn't I?
           Ellis smiles.
           They sit in silence. Ellis stares up at the boat hanging
           over them, its peeling hull lit by the firelight.
           Mud pinches the ash from the end of his cigarette, places the
           stub back in his shirt pocket. Noticing Ellis, Mud tilts his
           head back to take in the boat.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           It's a helluva thing.
           Mud pauses, his mind working on something.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Helluva thing.
           The two sit by the campfire staring up at the suspended boat.

          46 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - MORNING 46

           Mary Lee knocks on her way into the bedroom.

                          MARY LEE
           Time to get up.
           She begins picking clothes off the floor. Ellis, in bed,
           raises up on his elbows. He's tired from a late night.

                          ELLIS
           It's Saturday.

                          MARY LEE
           I'm going to Wal-Mart. I need you
           to come with me.

                          ELLIS

                          (MOANING)
           Mom.

                          MARY LEE
           Come on.
           She pulls the covers off of him.

          47 I/E. MARY LEE'S CAR/INTERSTATE - DAY 47
           The two ride in an awkward silence.

           40.

                         
          Ellis stares at the farmland passing by outside as Mary Lee
          steers the compact Toyota down a four-lane interstate.

                          MARY LEE
           Ellis I know what your father told
           you last night. That's not what I
           wanted. I wanted to sit you down
           and talk about it.

                          ELLIS
           What do you wanna talk about? You
           want to leave and that means they
           can tear up our house.

                          MARY LEE
           I've spent my whole life on that
           boat. I don't think it's too much
           to ask for your...
          Mary Lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in
          front of her. She slows to a stop.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           Oh no. I hope no one's hurt.
          There are flashing police lights up ahead. Ellis tries to
          see what's going on but can't make anything out past the line
          of cars. They inch forward.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           I'm just saying there are two sides
           to this. I haven't made up my mind
           about anything because I want you
           to be involved in my decision, but
           I need a change Ellis. I deserve
           one.
          As they approach the flashing lights, they see three State
          Trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane.
          The STATE TROOPERS stop each car, checking the trunks.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           I think they're searching people.
          A Trooper signals Mary Lee to pull up to a stop. Two other
          Troopers approach her vehicle. The first begins looking in
          her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her.
          She lowers her window.

                          TROOPER
           Can you open the trunk please
           ma'am?

                          MARY LEE
           Of course.

           41.

                         
          Mary Lee pulls the lever by her knee, and the second Trooper
          walks around the back of the car.

                          TROOPER
           Have you picked up or seen any
           hitchhikers today ma'am?

                          MARY LEE
           No sir.
          The Trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it.

                          TROOPER
           Have you seen this man?

                          MARY LEE
           No sir.
          The Trooper leans over and holds the paper out to Ellis.

                          TROOPER
           Son, have you seen this man?
          Ellis looks at the photo. It's of Mud. He looks exactly the
          same as he did last night, down to the shirt. In the photo,
          Mud's smiling, revealing his missing tooth.

                          ELLIS
           No.

                          TROOPER
           We've had reports that he's in this
           area. If you see him, call 9-1-1
           immediately.

                          MARY LEE
           We will officer.
          The Trooper pulls his head from the window.

                          ELLIS
           What'd he do?!
          The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

                          (MORE CALM)
           What'd he do?

                          TROOPER
           Move along please.
          Mary Lee pulls forward and speeds back up on the interstate.

                          MARY LEE
           My lord.
           (rolls up her window)

                          (MORE)

           42.

                         

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           How would you feel about moving
           into town with me?

                          (NO ANSWER)
           Please don't tell your father this,
           but I've been looking at a couple
           of places. I know it would be a
           big adjustment for you, but it
           might end up being something you
           like. You know living on the river
           isn't exactly everyone's idea of
           the good life. Ellis?
           He looks at her.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           Are you even listening to me?

          48 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - DAY 48

           Ellis busts through the door, grabs his backpack and is gone.

          49 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 49

           Ellis is off the houseboat and running up the bank.
           He heads down the dirt path, grabbing the Walkie Talkie out
           of his backpack.

                          ELLIS
           (into the Walkie)
           Neck! Neck, pick up!

          50 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY 50

           Ellis removes branches and readies the flat bottom boat to
           launch. The sound of Neckbone's bike arrives before he does.
           Neckbone crests the sand covered slope. He dismounts and
           starts to chain the bike up to a tree trunk.

                          NECKBONE
           So what's the big deal?

                          ELLIS
           My mom and I were headed to Wal-
           Mart on 165. There was a roadblock
           with state troopers. They searched
           our car and showed us a picture of
           Mud. They're lookin' for him.

                          NECKBONE
           I knew it! I told you that crazy
           sonofabitch was trouble. Did they
           say what he did?

                          ELLIS
           No.

           43.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           So'd you tell `em where he is?

                          ELLIS
           No. That's why I called you. We
           gotta warn him.

                          NECKBONE
           What?

                          ELLIS
           He's goin' to get Juniper today. I
           went out there last night and told
           him where we saw her. He needs to
           know people are lookin' for him.

                          NECKBONE
           You think he doesn't know that
           already? Jesus Ellis, why do you
           think he's on that island? You
           don't even know what he's wanted
           for.
           Ellis climbs in the boat and Neckbone yanks his shoulder.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Ellis! I'm serious. We don't know
           who this guy is.

                          ELLIS
           He loves her Neck. He told me.

                          NECKBONE
           I don't give a shit who he loves.
           Ellis starts the motor and waits for his friend.

                          ELLIS
           He's not dangerous.
           Reluctantly, Neckbone throws his leg into the boat.

                          NECKBONE
           It sounds like a shitload of state
           troopers think different.

          51 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 51

           Ellis and Neckbone emerge from the woods at Mud's campsite.
           They scan nearby tree limbs.

                          NECKBONE
           No tellin' where the hell he's been
           sleepin'.

                          ELLIS
           He may already be gone.

           44.

                         

           MUD (O.S.)
           Hey!
           The boys look straight up. Mud leans over the edge of the
           boat above them.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Up here!
           Mud drops them a rope with knots tied in it. Ellis starts
           inching his way up. Neckbone begrudgingly follows.

          52 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - CONTINUOUS 52

           Ellis pulls himself over the edge of the boat. He finds Mud
           sitting in the swivel chair behind the steering wheel. He
           writes in an open spiral notebook with a black Sharpie.

                          ELLIS
           What are you doin'?

                          MUD
           I'm gonna have to go back on our
           deal for the boat. I don't feel
           good about it, but I don't see any
           other way outta what I'm into.
           Neckbone makes his way on board. Mud has pulled a panel off
           the steering column. Exposed wires dangle.

                          ELLIS
           So you know about the state
           troopers?
           He looks up from his notebook.

                          MUD
           What state troopers?

                          NECKBONE
           The ones spreadin' your picture all
           over the place. Stoppin' cars on
           165 searchin' for your ass.
           Mud factors this in and then goes back to writing.

                          MUD
           I didn't know about that, but it
           doesn't surprise me. There plenty
           of folks lookin' for me right now.

                          ELLIS
           Why?

                          MUD
           I shot a man. Killed him.

           45.

                         
          Mud stands and walks to the back of the boat. The boys' eyes
          follow him cautiously.
          Mud lifts a hatch at the back that would typically house the
          batteries and engine wiring. There's nothing left but a hole
          into the trees. He makes a note.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry I didn't tell ya'll
           sooner, but I was hopin' to be gone
           before anything came of it. Didn't
           want you involved.
          Mud turns to really face them for the first time.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Ya'll have been real good to me.
           You're the only friends I got out
           here. If the state troopers have
           165 blocked, they'll have others
           blocked too. I won't get anywhere
           in a car. I want to try takin'
           this boat down, see if we can get
           it in the water.
          Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground. They don't say
          anything. Mud walks back to the steering column. He drops to
          his knees and fiddles with the wires.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           With a boat like this I can make it
           to the gulf in two days. I could
           get anywhere from there. But I'd
           need a boat at least this big to
           make it on open water. It's got no
           title, no owner, nobody lookin' for
           it. It's my best shot.

                          NECKBONE
           Who'd you kill?

                          MUD
           It was a bad piece of business.
           Ya'll don't need to hear about it.

                          ELLIS
           I need to hear about it.
          Mud sits up. He looks at Ellis, deciding how much to tell.

                          MUD
           Juniper made a mistake. She hooked
           up with a guy. He was no good.
           His name was Hutchins. Family owns
           a chain of restaurants down in
           Texas.

           46.

                         

                          ELLIS
           Where were you?

                          MUD
           I was around, but me and Juniper
           were on the outs. She met this
           Hutchins, he sold her on some lies.
           Got her pregnant. That's when he
           started showin' who he really was.
           He dropped June down a flight of
           stairs after whoopin' her half to
           death. She lost the baby. He made
           it so the doctors think she can't
           have children anymore. There're
           things you can get away with in
           this world and things you can't. I
           tracked him down at a motel just
           outside of San Antonio. He was
           there with another woman. That's
           where it happened.
          Mud's done with his story. He goes back to the wiring.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I understand if you can't help me
           anymore, but I need this boat. And
           I need to get it in the water fast.
          After a moment, he sits up and wipes sweat from his forehead.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I've made a list. Things we'll
           need. What do ya'll think?
          Ellis takes time to consider everything. He looks at
          Neckbone, who has a disgruntled look on his face.

                          ELLIS
           You did it for her? To protect
           her?

                          MUD
           Yeah.
          Ellis nods. Mud looks over at Neckbone, who still has the
          disgruntled look on his face.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           What do you think?

                          NECKBONE
           I think you want us to run around,
           stickin' our necks out, gettin'
           everything you need, just so you
           can take our boat.

           47.

                         

                          MUD
           That's about it.
          Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter.

                          NECKBONE
           What do we get out of it?

                          MUD
           What do you want?
          Neckbone looks to Ellis, judging his bargaining position.

                          NECKBONE
           What about that pistol?
          Mud eyes the boy, pulling on the nub of cigarette.

                          MUD
           I only got two things out here
           worth anything. This shirt...
          Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone
          tenses, but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open palm.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           And this pistol. I can't give you
           the shirt `cause I need it for
           protection, but if you help me get
           this boat in the water, the
           pistol's yours.
          Neckbone squinches his face in thought, sizing up this trade.

                          NECKBONE
           What kind is it?

                          MUD
           A forty five.

                          NECKBONE
           I guess we could work a deal like
           that.
          Neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol, but Mud puts it
          back in his jeans.

                          MUD
           We get this thing floatin' first.
          Neckbone looks over at Ellis, who shrugs.

                          NECKBONE
           All right then.

           48.

                         
           Mud smiles, flashing his missing tooth. He spits in his palm
           and holds it out to Neckbone. Neckbone, not sure about
           taking the spit hand, reluctantly shakes.
           Mud rips a page from the notebook and hands it to Ellis.

                          MUD
           Ya'll scrounge what you can off
           this list, but if we're gonna get
           this done right we'll need more
           help. Can you fetch Tom for me?

                          ELLIS
           Tom Blankenship?
           Mud has smoked down to the filter. He crushes the butt into
           his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket.

                          MUD
           I was hopin' to let that old
           assassin stay put, but we'll need
           him to get things ya'll can't. Can
           you find him?

                          ELLIS
           I know where he lives, but I've
           never spoke to him.

                          MUD
           Just tell him my name. He'll know
           you're serious.
           Ellis folds the list up. He and Neckbone start down the rope
           as Mud goes back to the wiring.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Boys?

                          (THEY PAUSE)
           Thanks.
           Ellis nods.

                          NECKBONE
           Don't lose my pistol.
           They continue down the rope. Mud continues his work.

          53 EXT. SHELLY'S OXBOW - DAY 53

           Ellis steers to the southern mouth of Shelly's Oxbow, the
           bend in the river that holds he and Tom Blankenship's
           houseboats, among others.
           He grounds the boat just shy of entering the Oxbow and steps
           over Neckbone to hop onto the bank.

           49.

                         

                          ELLIS
           You comin'?

                          NECKBONE
           I'll watch the boat.
           Ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged
           between the river and this short tributary.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Ellis?

                          ELLIS
           What?

                          NECKBONE
           Be careful. Galen always said that
           old man's crazy.
           Neckbone keeps his seat as Ellis darts into the woods

          54 EXT. TOM'S WOODS - DAY 54

           Ellis prowls around the small pine trees and bushes. He
           pauses, seeing the entrance to Tom Blankenship's boat.
           Something moves on the houseboat. Ellis hunkers down behind
           a bush. He sees Tom wrapping cable onto a metal spool.
           Ellis is nervous. He checks over his shoulder, nothing but
           woods. When he looks back to the boat, Tom is gone. In a
           crouch, Ellis moves closer.
           Taking a deep breath, Ellis steps out from the cover of the
           pine trees and heads up a walkway that leads onboard.

           TOM (O.S.)
           Why you huntin' me?
           Ellis flinches. He turns to find Tom Blankenship standing at
           the edge of the boat.

                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You deaf boy? I said why're you
           huntin' me?

                          ELLIS
           I ain't huntin you.

                          TOM
           What's your business here?

                          ELLIS
           I came to find you. I got a
           message for you.

           50.

                         

                          TOM
           You're Senior's boy.

                          ELLIS
           Yessir.

                          TOM
           What you got to say he can't tell
           me himself?
           Tom, rusty on pleasantries, brushes past Ellis as he heads
           inside the boat.

                          ELLIS
           It ain't from him.
           Ellis, not wanting to follow further, shouts from the planks.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

           MUD SENT ME!
           There is a silence. Then footsteps. Tom reappears.

                          TOM
           Mud sent you.

                          ELLIS
           Yessir.

                          TOM
           What do you know about it?

                          ELLIS
           He asked me to come get you.
           Tom straightens his back. He looks into the woods, searching
           for something he may have missed.

                          TOM
           Your daddy know this?

                          ELLIS
           No sir. Mud needs your help.
           Tom's mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy.

                          TOM
           Where is he?

          55 EXT. RIVER - DAY 55

           Neckbone bounces in the boat as it shifts in the choppy
           Mississippi water. His eyes are locked on the back of Tom's
           head. Tom rides stone faced in the front.
           Neckbone turns back to Ellis and raises his eyebrows as if to
           ask, "What's going on?". Ellis shrugs.

           51.

                         

          56 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 56

           Ellis runs the boat on shore. Tom splashes into the ankle
           deep water and helps the boys drag it onto the bank.
           Ellis takes the lead, walking ahead and scanning the
           treeline. Mud steps out, just past the shadow of the woods.
           Ellis turns to Tom and points.

                          ELLIS
           There he is.
           Tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward Mud.
           Ellis and Neckbone stay by the boat and watch.

           BY THE TREELINE,
           Mud watches Tom approaching. He corrects his posture and
           feebly attempts to smooth some wrinkles from his shirt.
           Tom stops in front of him, his eyes pinched in the sun.

                          TOM
           Mud.

                          MUD
           Sir.
           They stare at each other for a long moment. Neither one
           flinching.

           BY THE BOAT,
           At this distance, the boys can't hear what is being said, but
           they try and size up the situation through body language.

                          NECKBONE
           You think that's his dad?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know.

           BY THE TREELINE,

                          TOM
           Where is she?

                          MUD
           In town. Got here yesterday.
           Tom lowers his head. Frustrated.

                          TOM
           Why you out here like this?

           BY THE BOAT,

           52.

                         
          The boys see Mud take a seat on a nearby stump. He's
          explaining something. Tom listens, standing over him.

                          NECKBONE
           They don't look like family.
          Ellis watches Mud as he gestures and speaks. He seems
          different. Younger.
          Mud stops talking. Tom scratches a hand through his white
          crew cut. He begins pointing a finger at Mud. His face is
          flushed and the sound of his voice carries to the boys,
          though still unintelligible.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           He's really givin' it to him.

          AT THE TREELINE,
          Mud's head hangs as Tom shouts at him.

                          TOM
           You've spent your whole life
           followin' that girl! She's run you
           halfway cross the country and back,
           and for what? For this, left out
           on an island beggin' for help. A
           murderer. A thief.

                          MUD
           I ain't no thief.

                          TOM
           What would you call it then? Don't
           even mention draggin' those boys
           into this. Do you have any idea
           what you're doin'?
          Waits for a response, but Mud gives none.

                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I'm ashamed of you.
          Mud looks up at him.

                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Don't expect help from me. There's
           none to be given.

          AT THE BOAT,
          They see Tom turn his back on Mud and head toward the boat.
          Mud doesn't protest; he doesn't move.
          Tom brushes past Ellis.

           53.

                         

                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I'm ready.
          Tom shoves the boat back into the water. Neckbone helps him.
          Ellis looks back at Mud, who still hasn't moved from his
          stump. He goes to him. Tom sees this and stops pushing.

                          TOM (CONT'D)

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Dammit.

          AT THE TREELINE,
          Ellis stops a good six feet back from where Mud sits.

                          ELLIS
           You all right?
          Mud raises his head.

                          MUD
           Looks like we're on our own.
          He stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shirt.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I didn't want you bein' the one to
           do this, but I can't see a way
           around it. I need to get this
           letter to Juniper. Could you take
           it to her for me?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          MUD
           You have to be careful. You can't
           just walk up and knock on her door,
           you hear me? You have to watch
           yourself.

                          ELLIS
           I can handle it.
          Ellis steps forward and Mud hands over the note. Ellis takes
          it and walks back to the others.

          AT THE BOAT,
          Tom stares at Ellis as he climbs on board.
          Tom looks back at Mud, who is watching him. He gives the
          boat a final shove before pulling himself in. They motor
          away. Tom doesn't look back.

           54.

                         

          57 EXT. RIVER/SHELLY'S OXBOW - MOVING - DAY 57


                          NECKBONE
           You Mud's daddy?

                          TOM
           Mud didn't have no daddy. No
           mother I ever knew of. He was
           livin' in the woods when I met him.
           Younger than you are now.
           Tom doesn't offer anymore. Neckbone thinks on his answer.
           Ellis kills the engine near the mouth of Shelly's Oxbow. Tom
           jumps down into the knee deep river and wades onto shore. He
           turns back to the boys.

                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Ya'll need to watch yourselves.
           Don't go gettin' into something you
           don't have any business in. Mud's
           into something you don't want any
           part of. I suggest you forget
           about him.
           Ellis and Neckbone don't respond. Tom, with a final
           admonishing look, disappears into the woods.
           Ellis cranks the motor and points the boat up river.

          58 EXT. RIVER - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER 58

           Edges of the notebook paper flap in the wind. Neckbone reads
           Mud's letter to Juniper.
           Ellis reaches the bank where they stash their boat. He shuts
           off the motor and let's them drift. Neckbone folds the
           letter back up and turns to face Ellis.

                          ELLIS
           What do you think?

                          NECKBONE
           He loves her. You can tell that
           much. You gonna take it to her?

                          ELLIS
           I told him I would.
           Neckbone thinks about this seriously, shakes his head.

                          NECKBONE
           I don't know. Could be a lot of
           trouble.

           55.

                         

                          ELLIS
           You still got that trailer you made
           for your bike?

          59 EXT. DEWITT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 59

           Neckbone rides with Ellis on the back of his dirt bike.
           Cars and Trucks HONK and zip by them. Their speed is topped
           out at about 15 miles per hour. Mostly a result of the small
           3X4 metal trailer they are towing behind the bike.
           One of Senior's white fish coolers sits in the trailer.

          60 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 60

           Parked in the far corner of the lot, Ellis sits on top of the
           white cooler eyeing the Executive Inn. Neckbone straddles
           the dirt bike. A handful of cars are parked at the motel; an
           old Honda, a pick-up, and a BLACK LINCOLN.

                          ELLIS
           I say we start at the top, work our
           way down.

                          NECKBONE
           All right.
           They each grab an end of the cooler and carry it across the
           lot toward a flight of stairs.

          61 ON THE SECOND FLOOR, 61
           The boys set the cooler down in front of the first room on
           the corner. Ellis checks over his shoulder, nothing strange.
           Ellis knocks. They wait. No answer.
           They pick the cooler up and walk to the next door. Knock.
           After a moment, a BLACK MAN in his late sixties opens the
           door wearing boxers and an undershirt.

                          BLACK MAN
           What you want?

                          ELLIS
           We're sellin' fish. You wanna buy
           some?

                          BLACK MAN
           Fish?
           He looks at the two boys like they are insane.

           BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
           I don't want no damn fish.

           56.

                         
           He slams the door.
           They drag the cooler to the next door. As Ellis holds up his
           fist to knock, they hear a woman shouting a few doors down.

           JUNIPER (O.S.)

           STOP IT! STOP!
           Ellis heads for the room. Neckbone drags the cooler after
           him. Ellis reaches the motel room door, which has been left
           ajar. He places his hand on it and lets it fall open.

          62 INT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 62


           CARVER (O.S.)

           KEEP LYIN'! KEEP LYIN' AND I'LL

           CRACK YOUR NOSE OPEN!
           The door opens to CARVER(47), a tall, slender man in a dark
           Western cut suit, standing over Juniper. She's crumpled up
           in a ball at the end of the bed. Carver swats open-handed at
           her head. Grabs the top of her hair.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           You hear me bitch? Tell me another
           lie.
           Ellis rushes Carver with his shoulder as if he were breaking
           down a door. Carver is knocked off balance. He trips over
           the edge of the bed and crashes into the motel room wall.
           Carver, slightly stunned, gets to his feet and in two broad
           steps lands a man-sized punch across Ellis' face. It's hard.
           Ellis melts. He grabs the boy up by the scruff of his shirt.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           Who are you!? Who the hell are
           you!? Did he send you!?
           Carver removes a piece of paper from his pocket. It's a
           photo copied picture of Mud, different than the State
           Trooper's. Carver crams the photo in the boy's face.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           You know this man!? Look at him!
           Do you know him!?
           Blood trickles from a cut under Ellis' eye. He stutters
           under the shaking force of Carver's hands.

                          ELLIS
           I don't...I...

           NECKBONE (O.S.)

           FISH!!! IT'S FISH!!!

           57.

                         
          Neckbone is yelling at the top of his lungs, almost in a
          girl's pitch. Carver turns to him. The cooler is open
          behind them and Neckbone holds up two Ziplock bags of fish.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           We're just selling fish!
          Carver sizes things up. It takes a moment, but he settles.
          He snorts out a laugh and drops Ellis on the ground.
          Carver turns his attention back to Juniper, who is huddled up
          in the corner of the motel. Carver walks over to her.
          Opening a good-sized knife, he gets down in her face and
          holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek.

                          CARVER
           I know you know where he is. And I
           swear to God I'll cut through every
           one a you to find him.
          She flinches. Standing, Carver folds up his knife.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           We know you came here for him, and
           we know he's too stupid to leave
           you behind. So when he pops his
           head out of whatever shithole he's
           staying in, I'll be there. You
           tell him that.
          Carver turns, stepping over Ellis on his way out.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           And you need to mind your business
           boy.
          Neckbone moves from the doorway to let him pass. Carver is
          gone. Neckbone shuts the door and fastens the security
          latch. He kneels down to check on his friend.

                          NECKBONE
           You all right?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          NECKBONE
           He popped your eye.
          Ellis holds the back of his hand up to his eye which has
          begun to swell. The cut trickles blood over his cheekbone.
          Juniper moves to the sink. Ellis sits up, staring at her
          back.

           58.

                         
          She opens an ice bucket and wraps a handful of cubes in a
          towel. She turns and walks over to them, her eyes cast down.
          She kneels in front of Ellis, making eye contact for the
          first time. She touches his chin, gently pivoting it to see
          the wound. Her eyes are glassy.

                          JUNIPER
           Thank you.
          He stares back at her. He can't take his eyes off her. She
          holds the iced towel to his cheek. He doesn't even flinch.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           I'm so sorry.
          Tears form and run down her cheeks.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           Here.
          She takes his hand and places it against the towel. She gets
          to her feet and pulls a pocket book from a bag in the corner.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           How much is your fish? I'll buy
           the cooler full.
          Ellis motions Neckbone to the cooler. Neckbone goes over and
          crams his hand into the ice. He removes a Ziplock bag
          containing the note that Mud sent.
          Neckbone hands it to Ellis. Taking the note, he sets his ice
          down and walks over to Juniper.

                          ELLIS
           Mud sent us to give this to you.
          Juniper is stunned. She looks at the bag, then at the boys.

                          JUNIPER
           You've met Mud?
          Ellis nods. Neckbone speaks up from the back.

                          NECKBONE
           Yeah we met him.
          Juniper takes the bag. She removes the letter and takes a
          seat on the edge of the bed to read it.
          Ellis watches her eyes move along the paper. She smiles,
          which makes Ellis smile. After a moment, she folds it up.

                          JUNIPER
           He tells me to hold tight.

           59.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           Yeah, we read it.
          Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone.

                          JUNIPER
           Well do you know how long `hold
           tight' is?

                          ELLIS
           I think it's a couple days. He
           wants to get a boat for ya'll.

                          JUNIPER
           God.
          Juniper shakes her head and goes to the sink. She pulls a
          lighter from her jeans pocket and torches Mud's note.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           Tell him I'll wait.
          Running water over the ashes, she turns back to them.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           But I don't want ya'll involved.
           Tell him what I said and make that
           it. I don't want you gettin' in
           any trouble.

                          ELLIS
           We won't.

                          JUNIPER
           What do you call that?
          She motions to his swelling eye. Ellis shrugs.

                          ELLIS
           We'll be all right. Keep your door
           locked. We'll be in touch.
          Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler.

                          JUNIPER
           Wait.
          Ellis turns back.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           What's your name?

                          ELLIS
           I'm Ellis. That's Neckbone.

           60.

                         
           Juniper walks up to Ellis and puts her hands on his
           shoulders. She has to bend slightly to do it, but she kisses
           him just above his swollen eye.

                          JUNIPER
           Thank you Ellis.
           Ellis stares at her, infatuated.

                          NECKBONE
           We gotta go.
           Ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler. Neckbone slaps
           back the security latch and opens the door with his free
           hand. They walk out.

          63 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DUSK 63

           Ellis, his foot on the door, looks back at Juniper.

                          ELLIS
           Lock the door.
           She smiles. The door slams shut. The room number, 212,
           stares Ellis in the face. He takes a deep breath.

                          NECKBONE
           Let's go hard on.
           He and Ellis wrangle the cooler down the steps. The sun set
           while they were inside. A blue hue hangs over everything.

          64 I/E. CARVER'S LINCOLN/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 64
           Carver takes a drag off a cigarette from behind the steering
           wheel of his black Lincoln town car, conscious to blow any
           smoke out the open driver's window.
           His car, wedged between two others in the Piggly Wiggly
           parking lot, is pointed toward the Executive Inn. He watches
           as Ellis and Neckbone load the cooler onto Neckbone's bike.

          65 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 65

           Ellis enters his houseboat. It's quiet.
           He sees a note on the counter next to a can of soup. It
           reads, "I've gone to a movie. Warm up some soup for dinner.
           Love, Mom". Ellis picks up the can, not thrilled.
           He goes to the fridge and grabs a sack of peas from the
           freezer. Holding the peas against his eye he takes a seat at
           the counter and flips through a phone book.
           He finds what he needs and dials a corded phone. He waits.

           61.

                         

                          ELLIS
           Hello? Is May Pearl there?...This
           is Ellis...Hey, it's Ellis. Hey...
           What?...In the phone book... from
           his car commercials...I think
           they're all right...Tomorrow? Yeah,
           I can meet you... Okay. Bye.
           Ellis hangs up the phone. With the peas pressed firmly
           against his face, he smirks.

                          CUT TO:

          66 SERIES OF IMAGES: 66
           -Neckbone's sneaker busts through a rotten plank of wood.
           -Inside a decrepit wooden shack, Ellis gives Neckbone a look
           like he's a dumbass as they proceed to take the shack apart
           board by board. Ellis now has a full-on BLACK EYE.
          A66 -Neckbone stands lookout under the carport section of Ellis' A66
           houseboat. The coast clear, he gives Ellis a nod. Ellis
           pops open a metal locker and removes a small chainsaw and
           container of gas. He loads these into an empty fish cooler.
          B66 -Tom, sitting atop his houseboat with his pellet gun, watchesB66
           as the two boys sneak the tools away. He's displeased.
          C66 -At Neckbone's mobile home park, Ellis heaves loops of thick C66
           rope onto their mini dirt bike trailer. Neckbone stands
           nearby laughing with the rope's OWNER, a lanky guy with brown
           teeth and a Tasmanian Devil tattoo on his neck.
          AC66 -Ellis hoists Neckbone up by the foot allowing him to AC66
           unscrew a road sign.
          D66 -A mop soaked in black tar slops across the flat roof of the D66
           furniture store in downtown Dewitt. Neckbone and Ellis stand
           in the store's parking lot yelling up to the ROOFERS.
           -They get one's attention, and Neckbone points to a dried
           pile of leftover tar that has been dumped at the back of the
           building. The ROOFER swats a hand at the boys. They proceed
           to load the dried hunk onto the small trailer.
          E66 -From a distance, Neckbone and Ellis stand on a sailboat in E66
           the middle of a fenced-in marine junkyard. Surrounded by old
           boat parts, the boys begin shuttling several large metal
           pulleys off the sailboat.

          67 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 67

           Mud smiles, showing his missing tooth, as he looks over the
           load of items the boys have stacked in their boat. Neckbone
           tosses a loop of rope to him.

           61A.

                         

                          NECKBONE
          We've got more, but no motor.

           62.

                         

                          MUD
           This'll work for now. You get her
           my note?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.
          Ellis turns and Mud sees his black eye for the first time.

                          MUD
           Where'd you get that from?

                          ELLIS
           We came up on Juniper's room. A
           guy was in there beatin' up on her.
          Mud's face turns dark.

                          NECKBONE
           Ellis rushed him. Got smacked for
           it.

                          MUD
           What'd he look like?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know. Tall. Looked like a
           cowboy.

                          MUD
           Dark hair?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          MUD

           DAMMIT!
          Mud slings the rope to the ground and kicks it. His face is
          flushed. It's the first time the boys have seen him angry.

                          MUD (CONT'D)

           GOD DAMMIT!
          The boys back up. Mud takes a deep breath, tries to cool
          down. It takes a moment, then something occurs to him. He
          eyes Ellis with a look of genuine gratitude.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Thanks for lookin' after her.
          Ellis nods. Mud picks up the rope.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           His name's Carver. Brother of the
           man I shot. If he's here, then
           more are comin'.

           63.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           More what?
           Mud gathers the supplies and heads to the treeline. The
           boys, with their hands full, follow him.

                          MUD
           Bounty hunters. Carver's rotten,
           but his daddy's the one to be
           scared of. He'll spend all the
           money he has to see me dead. If it
           was up to me I'd put the whole
           family down same as the other. Not
           a decent man between `em.
           Mud stops and turns to lay a serious look on them.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Ya'll listen to me now. If you see
           that old man, don't get near him.
           He's the triple six real deal
           scratch you hear me?
           Mud waits for nods from them both.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           All right.

          68 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER/ISLAND - CONTINUOUS 68

           Galen drifts in his own boat out on the Mississippi River.
           He stares at something in the distance.

          A68 FROM ACROSS THE RIVER, A68
           He sees Neckbone and Ellis on the island walking with Mud.
           Galen, a concerned look on his face, keeps one hand on his
           motor and the other on a bulging net of mussel shells.
           His HELPER, a salty looking man in his fifties, sits at the
           front of the boat sipping Budweiser from the can.

                          HELPER
           What you waitin' for?

                          GALEN
           Shut up.
           After a moment, Galen cranks the motor and speeds away.

          69 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - DAY - LATER 69

           Mud stands with Ellis and Neckbone on the deck of the boat.
           He holds a pulley in one hand and a length of rope in the
           other. He stares up into the trees.

           64.

                         

                          MUD
           Ellis, can you climb up that trunk
           and get these hung?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          MUD
           Take a foot of line and tie `em off
           with a bowline knot. You know it?

                          ELLIS
           I'm not stupid.
          Ellis takes the pulley and scales the trunk without
          hesitation. Mud tosses his pocket knife to Neckbone.

                          MUD
           Neck, start cuttin' line. Three
           fifteen foot sections. Count a
           foot long as your arm.
          Mud begins threading the pulleys with rope. As Neckbone cuts
          rope, he sees the pistol stuck in the back of Mud's pants.

                          NECKBONE
           What's so special `bout that shirt
           you'd lose your pistol for it?

                          MUD
           It's got a wolf's eye sewn in the
           sleeve. More protection than a
           bullet ever gave. Tom swears by
           it.

                          NECKBONE
           He said he wasn't your daddy.

                          MUD
           Tom's the closest thing I ever knew
           to a father.

                          NECKBONE
           I never met my parents.

                          MUD
           It's hard not knowin' the ones you
           came from.

                          NECKBONE
           My uncle Galen tells me things
           about `em. He's the one that takes
           care of me.

                          MUD
           Tom did that for me.

           65.

                         
           Ellis drops down to the deck and grabs another pulley.

                          ELLIS
           What'd you mean when you called Tom
           an assassin?

                          MUD
           Tom's had lives you'd never know
           about. Grew up up North. Went to
           Yale. For a long time he was a
           paid killer for the C.I.A. Lived
           in Cuba in `63. He's probably
           killed more people than you've met.

                          (TO NECKBONE)
           Hand me that line.
           Neckbone tosses him an end of rope, looks to Ellis. Ellis
           gives a shrug before heading back up the trunk.

          70 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY - LATER 70

           Mud hangs off the tree fifteen feet up by a piece of rope
           tied around his waist. A series of ropes and pulleys
           crisscross from the boat to the trees.
           Neckbone and Ellis stand on the ground staring up at him.
           Mud holds a chainsaw and seems to be hesitating.

                          NECKBONE
           Well if you're gonna do it do it!
           Mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord. Angled on one of
           the main branches holding up the boat, Mud begins cutting.
           Ellis and Neckbone step further and further back as they
           watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb.
           Suddenly, the chainsaw stops. A deep CRACKING sound. The
           huge branch SNAPS, tumbling off lower limbs before crashing
           to the ground. Mud holds onto the trunk for dear life.
           The branch now rests on the ground, SILENCE. The ropes and
           pulleys hang taught, squeaking from the weight of the boat.
           Mud slowly lifts his head up. He smiles at what he sees.
           The rigging has held.

                          MUD
           One down!
           Neckbone and Ellis watch as Mud scampers around the trunk to
           the next branch. The chainsaw cranks back on.

                          NECKBONE
           This shit is crazy.

           66.

                         

          71 I/E. MARY LEE'S CAR/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE 71

                          AFTERNOON
           Ellis looks out the car window at HIGH SCHOOL KIDS that have
           gathered in the Piggly Wiggly parking lot. His hair is
           slicked to one side, and he's wearing a collared shirt.

                          MARY LEE
           You look nice.

                          ELLIS
           Thanks.

                          MARY LEE
           What time are you gonna be home?
           Ellis shrugs. She looks at him as the car radio rambles.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           No later than eleven?
           Ellis nods.

                          ELLIS
           You make up your mind?

                          MARY LEE
           About moving in town?

                          ELLIS
           About leavin' dad.
           Mary Lee thinks about how to answer, shuts off the radio.

                          MARY LEE
           You can't make other people change
           Ellis. If I'm unhappy then I'll
           have to be the one to change
           something.
           Ellis chews on the inside of his cheek and watches her avoid
           eye contact. He shoulders his way out of the car.
           Mary Lee takes a moment before driving off.
           As Mary Lee pulls away, Ellis takes in the scene.

          72 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN - LATE AFTERNOON - ELLIS POV 72

           He looks up at Juniper's motel room and sees her leaning on
           the railing smoking a cigarette. She doesn't see him.

          73 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS 73

           He pauses, noticing a MAN to his left who ALSO stares up at
           Juniper. The man, early thirties with a thick mustache, is
           JAMES. He leans against the grill of a black Lincoln.

           67.

                         
           Carver appears from inside the Piggly Wiggly. He holds a cup
           of coffee and is closely trailed by a fat little man,
           NELSON(56). They're all dressed in a similar fashion, a
           cross between rural farmers and rodeo stars.
           As Carver approaches the Lincoln, he scolds James for leaning
           on the grill. Carver rubs the hood with his coat sleeve and
           gives orders to the men.

           MAY PEARL (O.S.)
           Ellis!
           Ellis turns to see May Pearl hopping down from a Ford Bronco.
           She leans on the door and waves Ellis into the back.

           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
           Come on!
           Ellis takes another look at Carver and his men before running
           over to the Bronco.

          74 EXT. FIELD/BONFIRE - NIGHT 74

           A bonfire rages in the middle of an open field. A FEW DOZEN
           KIDS mingle between vehicles and the fire. Drinking,
           yelling, music blasting from car speakers.
           Ellis stands by himself next to the blaze with his hands in
           his pockets. May Pearl has vanished.
           Pryor, the skinny kid Ellis punched to get this date, wanders
           past. He makes eye contact. Ellis stares him down. Pryor
           glares back but then just skulks over to another group.

           MAY PEARL (O.S.)
           Try this.
           A Styrofoam Sonic Cup is thrust into Ellis' hand. He turns
           to find May Pearl standing next to him.

           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
           Come on.
           She leads Ellis behind one of the trucks parked nearby. May
           Pearl climbs onto the tailgate, a red glow across her face.
           No one else is around. Ellis hesitates.

           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
           You wanna sit down?
           Ellis takes a seat next to her. She looks at him, smiling,
           and gestures to his black eye.

           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
           You must really like to fight?

           68.

                         

                          ELLIS
           Not really.
          Ellis takes a sip from the Sonic cup. His face puckers.

                          MAY PEARL
           But you're not scared if you have
           to.

                          ELLIS
           I guess. You got a lot of friends.

                          MAY PEARL
           They're all right. I don't know
           all of `em.

                          ELLIS
           I bet you're pretty popular.

                          MAY PEARL
           Why do you say that?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know. `Cause you're nice
           to people.

                          MAY PEARL
           How do you know that?

                          ELLIS
           You're nice to me.

                          MAY PEARL
           But I like you.
          Ellis digs into his jeans pocket.

                          ELLIS
           I got this for you.
          He removes a bracelet made from the pearls he collected off
          Galen's porch. May Pearl takes it, begins putting it on.

                          MAY PEARL
           A bracelet?

                          ELLIS
           Neckbone's uncle caught the pearls.
           I thought with your name and
           everything...

                          MAY PEARL
           Thank you.
          She leans over, hugging him with a kiss on the cheek. She
          stays close.

           69.

                         

                          ELLIS
           You wanna be my girlfriend?
           She smiles, then kisses him.

          75 EXT. ELLIS' AND TOM'S HOUSEBOATS - MORNING 75

           Morning fog sits on top of the water around Ellis' houseboat.
           Ellis steps outside and makes his way to the ice machine. A
           loud WHISTLE comes from across the oxbow. Ellis walks to the
           edge of the garage.
          A75 He sees Tom Blankenship seated on the roof of his houseboat. A75
           He motions Ellis over.
           Ellis watches him, unsure of what to do. Another WHISTLE.
           Tom motions to him again. Ellis looks back at the house. No
           sign of his parents. He shoots a glance back at Tom.

          76 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - MOMENTS LATER 76

           Ellis bumps his father's boat against the side of Tom's
           houseboat. He steps up onto the deck and ties off.
           Tom, down from the roof, stands by his front door.

                          TOM
           You want some coffee?
           Tom disappears inside.

                          ELLIS
           I don't drink coffee.
           Ellis waits for a moment, but realizes this is Tom's way of
           inviting him inside. He enters.

          77 INT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 77

           This houseboat, although similar in size, is different than
           Ellis'. It's an actual wood shack that has been constructed
           atop a barge.
           Ellis looks at photos, books and memorabilia that cram the
           walls and shelves. It feels homey.
           Tom, his back to the boy, stands in the kitchen area pouring
           a cup of coffee.

                          TOM
           You been seein' Mud?

                          ELLIS
           No.

           70.

                         
          A collection of framed photos on a desk catches Ellis'
          attention. A young Tom with a pretty dark skinned girl.
          They seem happy. Another photo, late 60's, of Tom standing
          alone in a suit. He holds a LONG SUITCASE.
          Tom enters holding two cups of coffee.

                          TOM
           You don't have to lie to me boy.
          He hands Ellis a cup of coffee with a cartoon image of a dog
          on it. It reads, "I'm a real bitch in the morning!" Tom
          sits in a LazyBoy that he gently rocks in.

                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I've seen you runnin' around.
           Takin' things. He all right?

                          ELLIS
           He's okay.

                          TOM
           He get that boat down?
          Ellis nods. There is an awkward moment.

                          ELLIS
           He called you an assassin.
          Tom snorts out a laugh, sips his coffee.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           Is it true?

                          TOM
           How long have you known Mud?

                          ELLIS
           Few days.

                          TOM
           Well that's long enough to know
           he's full of shit.

                          ELLIS
           So it's not true.

                          TOM
           I was a sharpshooter in the army.
           In Mud's world, that makes me an
           assassin. Not exactly true, right?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah I guess.
          Tom notices the boy's disappointment.

           71.

                         

                          TOM
           You think he's a bad ass don't you?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know.

                          TOM
           You know why he's stuck out on that
           island?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          (HESITATES)
           He shot somebody.

                          TOM
           He tell you why he shot that man?

                          ELLIS
           Because he hurt Juniper.

                          TOM
           Right. The real reason Mud's in
           the trouble he's got is because of
           her. He's been in love with that
           girl since he was your age. They
           used to run all around here and it
           was the same back then. He'd
           follow that girl wherever she led
           him. Problem is she don't care
           about nobody but herself. I've
           told him as much. She'd bed down
           with the meanest snake she could
           find, then when things went bad
           she'd go runnin' to Mud. Mud would
           take her back, then go find
           whatever unlucky sonofabitch last
           put a hand on her and beat `em `til
           they knew to never touch her again.
           And this time I guess he thought a
           beating wasn't good enough. Had to
           shoot that fella. I don't know for
           sure, but I'd put money on Juniper
           knowin' he'd do it. And I have a
           suspicion she might of even told
           him to. Either way, those two are
           set for failure. Only chance Mud
           has is to cut her loose. Cause
           I'll tell you what, Mud's no bad
           ass. He's runnin' scared.
          Ellis can't look Tom in the eye, he's offended by the old
          man's remarks. Ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk.

                          ELLIS
           I gotta go.
          Ellis heads for the door, but stops short.

           72.

                         

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           You're wrong about Juniper. They
           love each other and they're gonna
           make it. If you weren't a wore out
           old man you'd know it was true.
           Tom eyes the boy, taking a sip from his cup. He nods a
           goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door.

          78 EXT. ISLAND/BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 78

           Ellis stomps out of the trees and is struck by the new
           position of the boat. It hangs three feet off the ground;
           SUSPENDED in dry dock. A clear-cut path of trees leads off
           toward the island's southern shore.
           Beside the boat, remnants of a giant fire smolder. Ellis
           surveys the MOUND OF ASH.

           MUD (O.S.)
           What you say Ellis?
           Ellis turns to find Mud standing on the deck of the boat
           holding a fistful of wires. He jumps down.

                          ELLIS
           I got more stuff.

                          MUD
           You find a motor?

                          ELLIS
           Not yet.
           (points to the ash)
           What's that?

                          MUD
           I made a bonfire.
           Mud enters the woods. Ellis follows.

                          ELLIS
           Why?

                          MUD
           Bonfire's an all purpose cure all
           for bad luck. I don't know where
           this boat's been or what kind of
           person had it before me. For all I
           know it could have some serious bad
           business left on it. We got too
           much ridin' on this thing to leave
           to chance. Where's Neckbone?

                          ELLIS
           Helpin' his uncle with a dive.

           73.

                         

          79 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 79

           Mud and Ellis exit the treeline heading to Ellis' boat.

                          ELLIS
           Tom called me over to his place
           this mornin'.

                          MUD
           What he say?

                          ELLIS
           He was runnin' down Juniper.
           Ellis looks for a response, but Mud just jumps up into the
           boat and starts throwing pieces of wood on shore.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           I told him he was a wore out old
           man. Told him he couldn't know how
           much you loved Juniper.

                          MUD
           You don't know his story.

                          ELLIS
           I don't care.

                          MUD
           You should. Tom loved a woman more
           than most men could in two
           lifetimes. They had a good life
           started together.
           Mud hops down and scoops a load of wood into his arms.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           She was pregnant with a little boy,
           but the birth got the better of
           `em. They didn't make it. Tom's
           been alone ever since. Lone wolf.
           Mud has begun walking back to the treeline. Ellis stays.

                          ELLIS
           I gotta go help my dad.
           Mud turns back but doesn't stop moving.

                          MUD
           Thanks for the wood Ellis.
           Ellis watches him go, thinking on what he said.

           74.

                         

          80 EXT. UNDERWATER - RIVER - DAY 80

           Fully suited in diving gear, Galen toils in the murky brown
           water at the bottom of the river.
           His gear consists of a typical wet-suit, wet-socks but no
           gloves. His metal helmet is not typical. It's welded from
           half a hot water heater that's been fitted with barbell
           weights. A hose connected to the top runs to the surface.
           Galen ties off a netted sack and yanks on its line.

          81 EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS 81

           A small air compressor chugs as Neckbone stands in the middle
           of Galen's boat pulling in the heavy rope. At the end, the
           net bulging with mussel shells appears.
           He manages to roll the heavy load into the boat before moving
           over to a crank handle that feeds another line.
           After several cranks, Galen's steel helmet breaches the
           surface. He places his hands on the edge of the boat as
           Neckbone removes the barbell weights.
           The weight removed, Neckbone takes off the helmet. Galen
           pulls himself into the boat, out of breath.

                          GALEN
           This shit never gets easy.

                          NECKBONE
           That's a good haul.

                          GALEN
           I've had worse.
           Galen reclines as Neckbone kills the air compressor and
           begins organizing the gear. He watches his little nephew.

                          GALEN (CONT'D)
           You doin' all right?

                          NECKBONE
           Yeah.

                          GALEN
           You don't need to tell me anything?

                          NECKBONE
           Tell you what?

                          GALEN
           I know I'm just your uncle, not
           much of a parent. But you can tell
           me things if you need to.

           75.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           I can tell you this helmet smells
           like my duck butter.

          82 EXT. ELDERLY WOMAN'S HOUSE - DAY 82

           Ellis holds a wrought iron door open with his backside as an
           ELDERLY WOMAN takes the paper bag of fish from his hands.
           Ellis walks back to the truck. Senior watches him, looking
           at the black eye.

          83 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/CATFISH PARLOUR - MOVING - DAY 83
           Ellis rides up front with Senior. Windows down, no radio.

                          SENIOR
           Where'd you get that black eye?

                          ELLIS
           A kid in town. He got his too.

                          SENIOR
           What you fightin' for?

                          ELLIS
           `Bout a girl.

                          SENIOR
           What girl?

                          ELLIS
           My girlfriend.

                          SENIOR
           You got a girlfriend?

                          ELLIS
           Yes sir.

                          SENIOR
           When'd that happen?

                          ELLIS
           Other day.
           Senior pats his shirt pocket and finds a smoke. Lights it.

                          SENIOR
           You seen your mother today?

                          ELLIS
           No.

                          SENIOR
           You not talkin' to me?

           76.

                         

                          ELLIS
           I'm talkin'. I'm talkin' to both
           of you. That's all ya'll want to
           do is talk.

                          SENIOR
           Well, that's your mother. Would
           rather tongue lash a problem than
           step up and handle it. You'll see
           one day. Women are tough. They'll
           set you up for things. You can't
           trust love, Ellis. If you're not
           careful, it'll run out on you. You
           just gotta pick a woman and roll
           the dice. Hope you don't wake up
           in fifteen years hatin' each other.
           Ellis keeps staring out the window as they pull into the
           parking lot of the Catfish Parlour Restaurant.

          84 EXT. THE CATFISH PARLOUR/THE PINES MOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON- 84


                          CONTINUOUS
           Senior climbs out of the truck and enters the restaurant.
           Ellis pops open the tailgate and reaches for a cooler.
           The Catfish Parlour is one business in a strip center row.
           There is nothing else around save for farmland and a motel
           across the road.
           Ellis notices Carver's black LINCOLN parked in the motel lot.
           He walks away from the truck to get a better look.
           Ellis scans the FOUR OTHER VEHICLES in the lot. All Texas
           plates. A maroon Cadillac sails past and turns into the
           motel. Ellis recedes to the rear of his truck.
           He watches as KING(76), a fireplug of a man, emerges from the
           Cadillac. Cramped from a long drive, he stretches and eyes
           the sign for the Pines Motel.
           A motel room door opens and Carver walks out. He's smiling
           and calls out to King. They hug as a green PICK-UP pulls up.
           MILLER, a slick dressed man in black boots, climbs out.

           SENIOR (O.S.)
           Ellis! Let's go!
           Ellis snaps around to find Senior leaning out the restaurant
           door. Ellis yanks the cooler down and drags it inside. He
           looks back over his shoulder for a final glance at the men.

           AT THE MOTEL,

                          CARVER
           Daddy this is Miller. He's one of
           ours.

           77.

                         

                          KING

                          (SHAKING)
           How do you do? Appreciate your
           help.

                          MILLER
           Yes sir.

                          CARVER
           We'll be in in a minute.
           Miller nods and enters the motel room. King turns to Carver.

                          KING
           Catch me up.

                          CARVER
           They work in shifts. Two outside
           her motel, the others either out
           searching or sleepin' here. I met
           with the county sheriff but he
           wasn't much help. Said they'd
           handle their own business, but I
           got two of their people on payroll
           and a person on the inside at the
           state police.

                          KING
           Good. Doin' good. Who all's here?

                          CARVER
           All but two now. Nelson and James
           are watchin' her place. I called
           the rest in.

                          KING
           Okay. Let's meet the men.
           Carver leads his father to the motel room.

          85 INT. PINES MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS 85

           Carver holds the door open as King steps inside. A door to
           his left connects another room which is empty.
           An episode of the Smurfs plays on the television. There's a
           MAN on each of the queen beds. Another THREE playing cards
           at a small table by the window. MILLER stands in the corner
           smoking. Empty Budweiser cans litter the room.
           King, unimpressed by the scene, looks at his son. Carver
           quickly moves in front of the television and turns it off.
           He stares down the men on the beds.

           78.

                         

                          CARVER
           Get up.
           (to the others)
           Ya'll pay attention.
          The men get up from the beds and the others put down their
          cards. Everyone slowly gathers into an audience.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           This is my father, King. He runs
           the show.
          Carver recedes as King steps forward. He speaks like a high
          school football coach.

                          KING
           Men. I wanna thank you for the
           work you're doin'. It's important
           work, and I want you to know what
           it means to me personally. I'm
           grateful for it. No man should
           have to bury his son. It's not
           natural, and it's a pain I hope
           none of you ever have to endure.
          King removes a photocopied picture of Mud from his pocket.
          He unfolds it, stares at it, then raises it to the men.

                          KING (CONT'D)
           This man did that to me. He took
           my youngest boy. And now, you're
           gonna help me get him.
          King stares at the men, keeping the photo held high.

                          KING (CONT'D)
           Now gather `round. Come on now, in
           a circle. I want ya'll to join
           hands.
          They do it reluctantly.

                          KING (CONT'D)
           Everybody take a knee.
          They do. King joins them on his knee and grabs Carver and
          another Man's hands.

                          KING (CONT'D)
           Bow your heads. I need you to help
           me pray for the death of the man
           that killed my son.
          They all bow their heads.

           79.

                         

          A85 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - MORNING A85

           A tarp is thrown back from a rusting boat trailer.
           Ellis and Neckbone stand by the trailer looking less than
           thrilled. It's covered in junk and debris.

                          NECKBONE
           You touch her breast?

                          ELLIS
           A little.

                          NECKBONE
           That's great man.

                          ELLIS
           Thanks.
           Ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           We could take it apart. Bring it
           out piece by piece.

                          NECKBONE
           It's welded. We'd just tear it up.
           What if we float it out?

                          ELLIS
           With what?

                          NECKBONE
           Come on.
           Neckbone walks to the trailer. Ellis follows.

                         

          B85 INT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS B85

           The boys open the front door and are met by a BLINDING LIGHT.

                          NECKBONE
           Jesus!
           They squint and shield their eyes.
           The light shuts off as quickly as it came on. Galen stands
           in front of them wearing his wet suit. The bar with the
           flood lights attached sits across his shoulders.
           The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots. Galen shuffles
           over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the
           lights. He labors to take a seat.

                          GALEN
           What do you think?

           79A.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           That's real good Galen.

                          (TO ELLIS)
           Gimme a minute.
          Neckbone, still blinking, goes back to his room. Ellis
          notices Galen staring at him. Galen pats the couch.

                          GALEN
           Come `ere Ellis.
          Ellis takes a seat on the other end of the couch. Galen pats
          the spot next to him. Ellis scoots over, uncomfortable.

                          GALEN (CONT'D)

                          (POINTING UP)
           You see that ceiling fan?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          GALEN
           I found it in the river. Works
           great. Best ceiling fan I've ever
           owned. This river brings a lotta
           trash down it. Some a that trash
           is worth a lotta money, some of
           it's not. You gotta know what's
           worth keepin' and what's worth
           lettin' go. You know the
           difference?

                          ELLIS
           I think so.

                          GALEN
           Neck looks up to you. Don't get my
           nephew into anything you can't get
           him out of.
          Galen forces a stare with Ellis, who nods. Neckbone enters
          as Galen begins to remove his light rig.

                          GALEN (CONT'D)
           Help Me Rhonda's just about a guy
           needing to get a piece to get over
           a girl that put one over on him.
           So you get your heart broke, don't
           walk around with a shit look on
           your face. Get back in there. Get
           your tip wet. You hear me?

                          ELLIS
           What?

                          GALEN
           You know what I'm sayin'.

           79B.

                         
           Ellis doesn't. Galen moves to an electric guitar leaning by
           a small amp in the corner.

                          GALEN (CONT'D)
           Ya'll wanna hang out? Alan's
           comin' over. We're gonna pump it
           up.

                          NECKBONE
           We got stuff to do.

                          GALEN
           Whatever.
           The boys exit as Galen turns on the amp.

                         

          C85 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS C85

           Galen pumps it up inside as Neckbone and Ellis walk to the
           boat trailer. Neckbone pulls a handful of long zip ties from
           his back pocket.

                          NECKBONE
           What were ya'll talkin' about?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know.

          86 EXT. ISLAND NORTHERN SHORE - DAY 86

           Mud's knife slices through a plastic zip tie.

                          MUD
           King. That's what they call him.
           A BOAT TRAILER rests atop FOUR, 55-GALLON BRIGHT YELLOW
           BARRELS affixed with plastic zip ties. The make-shift raft
           is half on shore with the back still floating in the water.
           The boys watch as Mud walks around the trailer cutting off
           the zip ties. The barrels kick out from underneath the
           trailer as this happens.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           He's their father. You didn't go
           near him did you?

                          ELLIS
           No.

                          MUD
           Good. That left-handed sonofabitch
           is the devil himself. If he's
           here, then it's time. We need to
           get Juniper out here.

           79C.

                         

                          ELLIS
           We still need a motor.

                          NECKBONE
           There's a motor in the scrap yard
           might work.

                          MUD
           I need one that runs.
          Mud moves to the front of the boat trailer and begins
          dragging it fully onto the bank. It's heavy.

                          NECKBONE
           I can get it runnin'. Tell him
           Ellis.

                          ELLIS
           It's true. He built his own dirt
           bike.

                          MUD
           All right then. Give it a shot.

                          ELLIS
           I don't know. That motor's worth
           somethin'. It's not like this
           other junk.

           80.

                         

                          NECKBONE
           It's been there for months.
           Nobody's even gonna know it's gone.
           Ellis hesitates. He looks to Mud.

                          MUD
           We do need a motor.
           Ellis thinks on it as Mud takes a deep breath and grabs the
           trailer again.

          87 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - DAY 87

           The supermarket is busy. Ellis stands at a pay phone out
           front as Neckbone kicks a vending machine nearby.
           Ellis looks at Juniper's motel. He scans the Piggly Wiggly
           parking lot and spots Carver's black Lincoln. Ellis picks up
           the phone and deposits some change. He dials.

                          ELLIS
           I wanna talk to room 212.

          88 I/E. JUNIPER'S MOTEL ROOM/PIGGLY WIGGLY - CONTINUOUS 88
           Juniper watches TV (o.s) at the foot of the bed. The phone
           rings. She snaps up, hits mute and grabs it.

                          JUNIPER
           Hello?

           INTERCUT WITH ELLIS,

                          ELLIS
           Juniper?

                          JUNIPER
           Ellis?

                          ELLIS
           It's me.

                          JUNIPER
           Thank god. I've been goin' crazy
           in this room. Is Mud okay?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah. It's time to take you out to
           him.

                          JUNIPER
           Now?

                          ELLIS
           Tomorrow. We'll come get you.

           81.

                         

                          JUNIPER
           What's goin' on?

                          ELLIS
           He's got a plan for ya'll to get
           away. Be ready tomorrow at five.
           Neckbone'll be waitin' at the back
           of the motel with a dirt bike.

                          JUNIPER
           They're watching my room.

                          ELLIS
           I'll take care of that. Just be
           ready at five.

                          JUNIPER
           Wait. Just wait. I don't know
           about alla this. I don't even know
           what he thinks we're gonna do.
           Where are we even gonna go? This
           is Mud. This is what Mud does.
          Ellis hears her crying through the phone.

                          ELLIS
           It's okay. He's got the boat. We
           helped him fix it up. It's a good
           plan. Just be ready.

                          JUNIPER
           Why are you even doing this?

                          ELLIS
           What do you mean?

                          JUNIPER
           Why are you helping us?

                          ELLIS
           Cause ya'll love each other.
          Juniper searches for a comment.
          Ellis, looking out over the parking lot, sees May Pearl
          getting out of a car with her MOTHER and SISTER.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           I'll see you tomorrow.

                          JUNIPER
           Wait.
          Dial Tone. Juniper holds the phone, worried.

           82.

                         

          89 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 89

           Ellis turns and watches May Pearl push a cart in the parking
           lot with her family. Neckbone bangs at the Coke machine.

                          NECKBONE
           How'd it go?

                          ELLIS
           We're good.

          90 I/E. CARVER'S LINCOLN/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - DAY 90
           Carver sits behind the wheel of his Lincoln. The man with
           the mustache, James, sits in the passenger seat next to him.
           Carver notices Ellis and Neckbone standing in front of the
           Piggly Wiggly. He climbs out.

           AT THE VENDING MACHINES,

                          NECKBONE
           Gimme a quarter. This shit took
           mine.
           Ellis watches May Pearl entering the grocery store. He calls
           out with a wave.

                          ELLIS

           MAY PEARL!
           Without stopping, May Pearl, along with her Sister and
           Mother, all turn. May Pearl sees him, but doesn't wave back.
           She continues inside.
           Ellis looks confused, then embarrassed. Neckbone notices.

                          NECKBONE
           It's all right man. She's with her
           family. Come on. I wanna get that
           motor before dark.
           They head to the dirt bike.

           CARVER (O.S.)
           Hey there!
           Ellis turns to see Carver approaching.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           You remember me don't you?
           Ellis nods. Carver notes the healing bruise on Ellis' face.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           I'm sure sorry about that. Ya'll
           caught me at a real bad time.

           83.

                         
          Ellis climbs on the bike. Carver walks over to them.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           Hold on now. One second. I don't
           want ya'll thinkin' I'm a bad guy.
           Ya'll were just trying to do a job,
           and I got in your way.
          Carver removes a roll of twenties and peels off two.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           Let's just say I bought that whole
           batch of fish ya'll were sellin'.
           Would forty cover it?

                          NECKBONE
           That'd bout do it.

                          ELLIS
           We don't want your money.
          Carver steps in close to the boys.

                          CARVER
           I bet ya'll really get around this
           town. Probably know every hole and
           ditch. Have ya'll come across the
           man whose picture I showed you?

                          ELLIS
           No.
          Carver removes a flier with Mud's picture and holds it out.

                          CARVER
           You sure about that? Take a look
           with your good eye.

                          ELLIS
           I'm sure.

                          CARVER
           What about that girl in the motel?
           The pretty one. Ya'll talk to her
           some more?

                          ELLIS
           No.
          Carver smiles. He tucks the flier and the forty dollars into
          Ellis' hand.

                          CARVER
           There's a number on there. Ya'll
           let me know if you do.

           84.

                         
           Neckbone cranks the engine and backs the bike up with his
           feet. They pull away.
           Moving, Ellis looks back to see Carver watching them.

          91 EXT. CRAWFORD'S JUNKYARD - DUSK 91

           Neckbone pulls back a loose section of chain-link fence
           surrounding the marine junkyard. Ellis crouches through.

           INSIDE THE JUNKYARD,
           Ellis and Neckbone creep through piles of starboard and boat
           parts. They stop at a party barge with only one pontoon. At
           its rear hangs a big rusted motor, 200 horsepower.
           Neckbone quickly disassembles its attachment. The motor pops
           loose leaving the boys to strain against its heavy weight.
           They ease it to the ground.

                          NECKBONE
           Jesus that's heavy.
           The boys get on either side of the motor and begin half-
           dragging it back to the fence line.

           ACROSS THE YARD,
           A LITTLE GIRL(10) dangles her feet off a loading platform and
           bites at an ice cream sandwich. She watches Neckbone and
           Ellis from a distance.

          92 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 92

           Ellis walks onto the houseboat as the sound of Neckbone's
           bike fades in the trees. He stops, noticing a PAPER BAG
           sitting on the water's edge of the boat. He goes over to it.
           He opens the sack and takes a quick inventory. A loaf of
           bread, potted meats, a bottle of Jack Daniels, a roll of
           cash, and an Arkansas boat tag.
           Ellis looks around, no one. He looks over to Tom's boat.
           It's dark. Ellis scoops up the sack and heads inside.

          93 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 93

           The digital wristwatch changes from "4:59" to "5:00".
           Neckbone sits on his bike parked near the vending machines at
           the Piggly Wiggly. Ellis, on the payphone, scans the parking
           lot. No sign of Carver's Lincoln. No other Bounty Hunters.

                          NECKBONE
           Where are those bastards?

           85.

                         

                          ELLIS
           I don't know.

                          (HANGS UP)
           She's not answerin'.

                          NECKBONE
           What do you wanna do?

                          ELLIS
           Take your bike around the side.
           I'll check her room. We'll just
           have to hope no one sees us.
           Neckbone cranks the bike and speeds toward the motel. Ellis
           looks to the motel, then the parking lot.

          94 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN - MOMENTS LATER 94


           ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
           Ellis cautiously heads up the stairs. He eyes the parking
           lot at the Piggly Wiggly but still sees no sign of Carver's
           men.
           He moves quickly toward Juniper's door. Checking over his
           shoulder, he knocks. No answer. He knocks again. Nothing.
           He peeks through the window. No lights. No movement.

          95 BY THE DIRT BIKE, 95
           Neckbone gets off his bike and slips to the corner of the
           building. As he peeks his head out, Ellis nearly knocks him
           over on his way downstairs. They both flinch.

                          NECKBONE
           Shit. Was she there?

                          ELLIS
           Nothin'.
           Ellis notices the front office

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           Come on.

          96 INT. EXECUTIVE INN/FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 96

           The MOTEL CLERK(29) doesn't look up from his issue of
           Lowrider as Ellis and Neckbone enter.

                          ELLIS
           Scuse me, sir?

                          MOTEL CLERK
           Yeah.

           86.

                         

                          ELLIS
           We're lookin' for the girl in room
           212. You seen her?

                          MOTEL CLERK
           I've seen her.

                          ELLIS
           You see her today.

                          MOTEL CLERK
           Yeah, she came down askin' for
           directions to the nearest bar. I
           told her to head out to a place on

           61.
           Ellis digests this. They turn to leave.

           MOTEL CLERK (CONT'D)
           Wait a second, are ya'll the little
           bastards tryin' to sell fish to the
           guests?
           They're already out the door.

          97 EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK 97

           Ellis and Neckbone pull into the gravel lot in front of a
           roadside bar. The cinder block building sits by itself just
           off the highway. Cars and motorcycles fill the lot.

                          NECKBONE
           You think this is it?

                          ELLIS
           It's gotta be.

          98 INT. ROADSIDE BAR - CONTINUOUS 98

           The small bar is loud and crowded. Shoulder to shoulder
           PATRONS bump against one another as MUSIC blares.
           Neckbone and Ellis press through the crowd searching for
           Juniper. They are a good foot shorter than anyone else.
           Ellis notices a man at the bar. It's Miller, the bounty
           hunter from King's motel. He's staring at something across
           the room. Ellis follows his line of sight.
           The crowd weaves in front of him, but then he sees her.
           Juniper leans against a pool table at the far end of the bar.
           A GUY(32) whispers in her ear and kisses her neck. She
           throws her head back, laughing. Ellis watches in disbelief.
           Nearby, the BARTENDER(46) fills a customer's shot glass. The
           two underage kids catch his attention.

           87.

                         
           Ellis' face is frozen, locked on Juniper. Neckbone places a
           hand on his shoulder.
           Juniper's eyes drift toward the boys. She makes eye contact
           with Ellis, and her smile vanishes. The Guy keeps whispering
           in her ear. Juniper straightens her back slightly.
           Ellis can't take his eyes off her. Juniper stares back at
           him, but doesn't make a move.
           After a moment, Juniper's eyes fall to the floor. She turns
           her head back to the Guy. The crowd fills back in and the
           image is out of Ellis' reach.

           BARTENDER (O.S.)
           What the hell are ya'll doin'?!
           The Bartender swoops in, grabbing them both by the backs of
           their necks and shoving them toward the door. Ellis strains
           against the thick hand. He tries to get another look at
           Juniper, but it's too crowded.

                         

          99 EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 99

           The Bartender flings Ellis and Neckbone into the parking lot.
           Neckbone slides on the loose gravel.

                          BARTENDER
           Ya'll stay outta here!
           Ellis just stands staring at the front door. The Bartender
           makes a swatting motion toward them.

                          BARTENDER (CONT'D)

           I SAID GET OUTTA HERE!!!
           Neckbone gathers his friend and leads him away.

                          NECKBONE
           Thanks a lot asshole!

                          (TO ELLIS)
           Come on man.
           They head over to Neckbone's dirt bike. He pulls out the key
           and climbs on. Ellis hesitates.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           I'll take you home.

                          ELLIS
           We're gonna have to tell Mud.
           Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly.

           88.

                         

          100 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 100

           The boys struggle to pull the heavy motor out of their boat.
           It hits the shoreline with a thud. They lean over it,
           sucking air.

                          ELLIS
           Just leave it. Mud'll have to help
           get it.

                          NECKBONE
           What're you gonna tell him?

                          ELLIS
           I'll just tell him the truth.

          101 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - NIGHT 101

           Mud stands at the back of the boat, which now rests on the
           boat trailer near the water. His face is clean shaven and
           his hair is wetted back. His shirt, still filthy, is tucked
           into his pants.
           He whistles and works by the light of a small fire nearby.
           Ellis steps out from behind a tree. He's holding the grocery
           sack that was left on his houseboat.

                          ELLIS

           MUD!
           Mud, hearing the voice, quickly puts down his tools and turns
           to the woods. He smooths his clothes down.

                          MUD
           What you say there?!
           Ellis appears out of the dark, followed by Neckbone. Mud's
           eyes search the treeline for Juniper.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           What you say Ellis?
           Ellis can't look him in the eye.

                          ELLIS
           We got that motor.

                          MUD
           Is Juniper okay?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          MUD
           Where is she?

           89.

                         

                          ELLIS
           She didn't meet up with us.

                          MUD
           What happened? Was it Carver?

                          ELLIS
           It wasn't Carver.
          Mud straightens up, prepares for the news.

                          MUD
           What's goin' on Ellis?

                          ELLIS
           She was supposed to meet us on the
           side of the motel. She never
           showed up. We went asking for her.
           The motel clerk told us she went to
           a bar out on 61.

                          MUD
           What?

                          ELLIS
           We tracked her down. She was there
           with another guy.

                          (HESITATES)
           They were together.
          Mud's face drops. He walks to the fire and shakes a cooking
          pot resting in the coals. The pot bubbles with roof tar.

                          MUD
           She probably thought Carver was on
           to her.

                          ELLIS
           She knew the plan Mud. She just
           didn't show up.

                          MUD
           What was she doin' with the other
           guy?
          Ellis hesitates, not wanting to say. Mud pushes.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           What were they doin' Ellis?

                          ELLIS
           They were playin' pool. Drinkin'.
           He was close up on her. They were
           laughin'. He kissed her on the
           neck.
          Mud nods.

           90.

                         

                          MUD
           And that's how it is.
           He takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins
           pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick.

                          ELLIS
           What do you want us to do?

                          MUD
           Just go home Ellis.
           Ellis looks at Neckbone, then sets the grocery sack on the
           ground.

                          ELLIS
           Tom left this for you.
           They slowly retreat into the woods and disappear.
           Mud turns back to the campfire and shoves the pot into the
           ashes. His eyes, soft and red, reflect the flame.

          102 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 102

           Ellis and Neckbone motor away from the island in the flat
           bottom boat. They look back at the shore.

                          ELLIS
           You think it's all right to leave
           him alone?!

                          NECKBONE
           I doubt it!
           Neckbone sees Ellis' concern.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           I'll sleep over at your house
           tonight! We can check on him first
           thing tomorrow!
           Ellis nods. As they head further up river, the island grows
           smaller, silhouetted by the moonlight.

          103 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - MORNING 103

           Neckbone snores, sprawled out on top of a sleeping bag on the
           floor. Ellis sits up in bed with something on his mind.
           He gets up and steps gingerly over Neckbone to exit the room.

          104 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 104

           The house is silent. Ellis slips into the kitchen and picks
           up the phone receiver mounted on the cabinet.

           91.

                         
          He pulls the cord out to stand with his face in the corner.
          He dials, waits, and speaks softly into the receiver.

                          ELLIS
           Hello? Is May Pearl there...This
           is Ellis...I called yesterday, you
           give her my message?...My name is
           Ellis. I'm her boyfriend...Oh,
           she's asleep...I said she's asleep?
          The front door flies open. Senior storms headlong toward
          Ellis. He shouts.

                          SENIOR

           MARY LEE!
          Ellis turns as Senior yanks the phone by the cord. It snaps
          out of Ellis' hand and smashes apart on the floor. Ellis
          flinches at the sight of his father flying at him.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           What the hell have you been doing?

           WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOIN'?!!
          Senior grabs Ellis by the arms and shoves him against the den
          wall. Mary Lee comes running from her room.

                          MARY LEE

           SENIOR! SENIOR DAMMIT!
          She slaps at her husband's arms and back. He swats her away.

                          SENIOR
           You tell her. You tell her what
           you've been up to.

                          ELLIS
           I don't know what you're sayin'.

                          MARY LEE
           Take your hands off him Senior!
          Senior keeps Ellis pinned to the wall with his left hand. He
          opens up and addresses Mary Lee with his right.

                          SENIOR
           J.J. Crawford said a boat motor
           went missin' from his stock yard.
           Said his daughter saw this one and
           his friend haulin' it off.
          This makes Mary Lee pause.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           Now you tell me right now, did you
           steal that motor?

           92.

                         

                          ELLIS
           We didn't steal it.

                          SENIOR
           Lie to me again.

                          ELLIS
           We thought it was junk. We didn't
           think it was worth anything.

                          MARY LEE
           Ellis?
          A cool anger rushes over Senior's face. He releases Ellis
          and takes a step back.

                          SENIOR
           You tell me I raised a thief?

                          ELLIS
           I'm not a thief.

                          SENIOR
           You take property that's not yours.
           Property that belongs to another
           man. That junk is his livelihood.
           I'm ashamed of you.
          Ellis drops his head. His face flushed.

                          MARY LEE
           Senior.

                          SENIOR
           (to Mary Lee)
           Shut your mouth. You think you can
           take things and not have him see
           it? Neither one of you has any
           respect for a man's livelihood. A
           life that puts clothes on your back
           and food in your stomach.

                          MARY LEE
           Don't you blame this on me. One
           doesn't have a thing to do with the
           other and you know it.

                          SENIOR
           Don't tell me what I know. If you
           can steal a man's life out from
           under him in front of your son and
           think he won't take a lesson from
           it than you're even dumber than you
           look.

                          ELLIS
           Stop it dad.

           93.

                         
          Senior volleys a finger at Ellis.

                          SENIOR
           She's raisin' you a snake like
           herself, and you can curl up with
           her `fore I give a damn. You just
           remember this when you watch them
           rip this house apart board by
           board. You Hear Me!
          Mary Lee slaps Senior hard. He turns to her, saying nothing.

                          MARY LEE
           You're a man who's never had the
           strength to support his own life.
           I never asked you for a thing, and
           I've never took a thing from you
           that I couldn't provide for on my
           own. If they do tear my home apart
           the only joy I'll have in my heart
           is knowin' that they'll be tearing
           you out of my life for good.
          She wipes her eyes and turns her attention to Ellis.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           Ellis. You'll return that motor
           from where you found it and you'll
           apologize in person to the man you
           took it from. I won't hear about
           anything like this again.
          Mary Lee walks to the front door. She collects her purse and
          keys and exits quietly.
          Senior and Ellis stand in silence, which feels even more
          uncomfortable than the shouting. Ellis finally speaks.

                          ELLIS
           I can't take that motor back. But
           I'll pay him for it. I'll pay him
           what he wants for it.
          Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy.

                          SENIOR
           I don't care what you do Ellis.
          Senior retreats to the bedroom. Ellis is left alone in the
          wake.
          He looks to his room. The door opens slightly and Neckbone
          takes a step out. Neckbone doesn't say anything. He just
          bites at his lip, sympathy for his friend.

           94.

                         

          105 EXT. ISLAND SHORE LANDING - DAY 105

           Charred hunks of driftwood smolder in a ruined pile on the
           sand. They constitute the remains of a large bonfire.
           Neckbone and Ellis stare at the ash.

                          NECKBONE
           What the hell's all this?

                          ELLIS
           It's a bonfire.

                          NECKBONE
           I guess he didn't care about bein'
           seen.
           Ellis kicks at one of the burned logs. He bends down and
           finds the bottle of Jack Daniels, smashed.

                          ELLIS
           He had something else on his mind.
           Come on.
           Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline.

          106 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 106

           Mud's yellow shirt hangs, partially ripped, from a tree
           branch. Ellis pulls it off the limb.
           Concerned, they head deeper into the woods, over the fallen
           tree trunk that bridges the creek.

          107 EXT. ISLAND WOODS AND SOUTHERN SHORE - DAY 107

           The boys watch Mud through the trees at a distance. He's
           crouched on the deck of the boat fiddling with wiring. Mud,
           giving no sign he sees the boys, yells out to them.

                          MUD
           What are ya'll hidin' for?
           Mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank. They
           emerge from the woods. Ellis carries the yellow shirt.

                          ELLIS
           We found your shirt.
           Ellis tosses it to him. Mud tosses it back.

                          MUD
           Keep it. I don't need it anymore.
           Mud goes to the motor at the rear to tinker with more wires.

           95.

                         

                          ELLIS
           We saw what's left of your bonfire.

                          (NO RESPONSE)
           Somebody could've seen you.

                          MUD
           I guess.

                          ELLIS
           You do some drinkin' last night?

                          MUD
           I did a lot of drinkin' last night.
          Mud stops and walks over to address the boys. His face is
          pale and his manner is curt.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           Neck I'm gonna need you here to get
           the motor runnin'. Ellis I need
           you to do something else for me.
          Mud removes a folded note from his back pocket.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I need you to take this to Juniper.

                          ELLIS
           Okay Mud.
          Ellis takes the letter. Mud goes back to the boat motor. He
          motions to Neckbone to join him.

                          MUD
           Let's go.

                          ELLIS
           You still takin' Juniper?

                          MUD
           I had a dream last night. I saw
           Juniper laying in a field with
           another man. They were making
           love. I walked out into the field.
           Walked toward `em. I was so angry
           the tips of my ears were burnin'.
           That's how I knew I was gonna kill
           this man. But when I got up close
           enough, I saw that the man she was
           with had tattoos on his back, just
           like mine. I moved in closer and
           the guy turns his head back toward
           me. Hair for hair, dead truth, the
           guy she was with was me.
          Mud ducks back under the motor. Ellis looks at Neckbone,
          worried.

           96.

                         

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I'll finish the boat, but I'd be
           surprised if I live long enough to
           sail on it. A vision of yourself
           is a sure sign of death. Neck can
           you grab me a socket wrench?
           Neckbone and Ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby. They
           crouch by it, speaking quietly.

                          NECKBONE
           You be all right?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah. What about you?

                          NECKBONE
           He'll be okay.

                          ELLIS
           Can I borrow your bike?
           Neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket. Hesitates.

                          NECKBONE
           Don't tump it.
           Ellis nods. Neckbone walks over to Mud with the toolbox.
           Letter in hand, Ellis gives a final look toward Mud's labor
           and walks back into the woods. On his way, he stops to hang
           Mud's shirt on a tree branch.

          108 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY 108

           Ellis rides in the flat bottom boat alone. He stares at the
           letter in his hand.

          109 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - DAY 109

           Ellis sits on the dirt bike. He scans the parking lot. No
           black Lincoln. His eyes stop on a green pick-up. Miller,
           sits inside.
           Ellis looks around and finds a pay phone nearby. He gets off
           the bike and walks toward it. Ellis removes the flier Carver
           gave him. He dials a phone number copied at the bottom.

                          ELLIS
           (into the phone)
           Hello. I saw the guy you're
           lookin' for...Yeah, he's crazy
           lookin'. Saw him at the Wal-mart
           outside of Gillet. He was buyin'
           some beanie weenie...'bout five
           minutes ago.

           97.

                         
           Ellis hangs up the phone. He walks back over to the bike,
           climbs on and waits.
           After a moment, he watches as Miller's green pick-up pulls
           out of the Piggly Wiggly parking lot and races away. Ellis
           cranks the bike.

          110 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 110

           Ellis, at a slight crouch, keeps his eyes on the Piggly
           Wiggly parking lot. The green pick-up is nowhere in sight.
           At Juniper's door, he knocks twice, softly. The door swings
           opens. Juniper stands there, holding a lit cigarette.

                          JUNIPER
           I was wonderin' when I'd see you.
           Ellis checks over his shoulder and walks inside

          111 INT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 111

           The bed is unmade and the room is a bit of a mess. Ellis
           keeps his head down. Juniper closes the door and takes a
           seat on the edge of the bed. She grabs the remote control
           and mutes the television.

                          JUNIPER
           I'm sorry about last night. I
           didn't plan on...
           Before she can finish Ellis has fished the letter out of his
           pocket and holds it out to her.

                          ELLIS
           I'm supposed to give this to you.
           Juniper takes the letter.

                          JUNIPER
           Okay.
           Ellis goes to the door. He pulls the bedroom curtain back
           slightly to check the parking lot. The coast is clear.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           Did you read it?

                          ELLIS
           No. I gotta go.

                          JUNIPER
           Ellis?
           He turns to her.

           98.

                         

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry.

                          ELLIS
           All you had to do was be there.

                          JUNIPER
           I couldn't.

                          ELLIS
           Then why'd you even come here?

                          JUNIPER
           I came here to leave with him. I
           really did. But now...now I guess
           I just came to say goodbye.
          His eyes fall to the floor.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           You don't know us Ellis. We've
           been headin' this way for a long
           time.

                          ELLIS
           I know he'd do anything for you.
          She puts her cigarette out in a Coke can on the floor.

                          JUNIPER
           You really believe that?
          Ellis nods. Juniper speaks to him gently, almost smiling.
          It's a look of resignation.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           Mud's a born liar. That's what
           makes him so likable. He makes
           people feel good about themselves.
           He's a romantic. I don't think he
           means to hurt people. But when
           people get close to him, that's
           what happens.
          Ellis watches her as she goes to the sink and wets the end of
          a towel. She dabs her eyes at the mirror.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           I do love him Ellis. But I can't
           spend the rest of my life runnin'
           with him. I may not know what kind
           of life I want, but I know that's
           not it.
          Her back to him, Ellis watches as she unfolds the letter and
          begins reading. He angles himself to see her face in the
          mirror. He watches her eyes scanning the words. No emotion.

           99.

                         
           She finishes, folds the letter back up, then turns to him.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           Tell him I understand.

                          ELLIS
           What's it say?

                          JUNIPER
           It says it's over. Tell him I've
           packed my things. Tell him I've
           gone.
           She takes a deep breath and smiles at him.

                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
           Bye Ellis.
           Ellis turns and walks out.

          112 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 112

           Ellis, dejected, no longer bothers to look over his shoulder.
           He walks to the staircase but stops there. Feeling the need
           to say something more, he goes back to her room.
           He puts his knuckle flat on the door but hesitates. He leans
           over and looks through the window.
           The sliver in the curtain gives him a glimpse. Juniper is
           curled up on the end of the bed. She is sobbing.
           Ellis watches longer than he should before pulling his head
           away from the window. Ellis heads back downstairs.

          113 EXT. INTERSECTION/SONIC DRIVE-IN - DAY 113

           Ellis, riding the dirtbike, looks to his left into the Sonic
           Drive-In parking lot. The high school kids have gathered
           there again.
           He notices a rust colored Ford coup. The driver, an older
           kid named KYLE(18), sits beside May Pearl laughing.
           Ellis steers into traffic and crosses the street. He pulls
           onto a patch of grass at the edge of the Sonic parking lot.
           In one motion, Ellis tumps the bike on its side and makes a b-
           line for the coup.

           INSIDE THE CAR,
           Kyle's hand is on May Pearl's knee.

           100.

                         

                          KYLE
           So what'd she say?

                          MAY PEARL
           She said she didn't like him that
           much. I told her I thought he was
           all right.
          Ellis appears with his elbows in the driver's side window.
          He sticks his head so far in the door that Kyle has to lean
          back in his seat to make room. May Pearl is surprised. Kyle
          snorts out a laugh.

                          ELLIS
           You get my phone calls?

                          MAY PEARL
           What?

                          ELLIS
           I've been callin' you.
           (motions with his head)
           Who's this guy?

                          KYLE
           Get your head outta my car kid.
          Ellis takes his right elbow and quickly knocks Kyle in the
          mouth. It splits his upper lip. Kyle grabs his face.

                          KYLE (CONT'D)
           Shit!

                          MAY PEARL
           Ellis!

                          ELLIS
           I called you twice yesterday. Your
           sister didn't tell you?
          Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement.
          From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and
          considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before.
          Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to
          converge on them.
          Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the
          pavement. Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him.
          Another punch to Ellis' face. May Pearl is out of the car
          and yelling.

                          MAY PEARL
           Kyle! Stop it Kyle!

           101.

                         
          May Pearl pulls Kyle by the collar. By his own will, he
          raises off of Ellis, keeping an eye on him.
          A streak of blood stretches from Ellis' nose to his ear. He
          gets to his feet, dazed.
          Ellis wipes at his nose and sees May Pearl shove Kyle. Kyle
          smiles and turns to his friends, who laugh. The CROWD that
          has collected consists of older high school guys and girls.
          Ellis steps toward May Pearl and is met with a shove too.

           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
           What the hell are you doin' here
           Ellis?!

                          ELLIS
           What?

                          MAY PEARL
           You can't just run up and punch
           people I'm with!

                          ELLIS
           I'm sorry, I just wanted to know
           why you hadn't called me back.

           I...

                          MAY PEARL
           Why would I call you back Ellis?

                          ELLIS
           Because you're my girlfriend.
          The crowd is watching.

                          MAY PEARL
           I'm not your girlfriend! We went
           on one date. One!

                          ELLIS
           We kissed.

                          MAY PEARL
           That doesn't matter!

                          ELLIS
           Yeah but...

                          MAY PEARL
           But what Ellis?! What did you
           expect?!

                          ELLIS
           I love you.

           102.

                         

                          MAY PEARL
           You're fourteen!

                          ELLIS
           Don't. Wait. We can make this
           work. We can figure it out. I
           love you.

                          MAY PEARL
           What?
           Ellis is losing it. His eyes are red. He looks at the crowd
           of kids. There are smiles and some snickering. May Pearl is
           speechless. She just stares at him.
           Ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike.
           May Pearl's girlfriends gather around her. She shakes her
           head, dumbstruck.
           Ellis lifts the bike off the ground. He looks back at May
           Pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in
           front of her friends. Ellis speeds off.

          114 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/RIVERBANK - DAY 114

           A fire snaps and pops on the riverbank next to Ellis'
           houseboat.
           Ellis drags a piece of particle board from a trash pile
           nearby. He drops the board onto the fire and stands back to
           watch the blaze. Neckbone's bike leans on a tree behind him.
           Senior's truck rattles to a stop in the gravel just down the
           bank. He jumps out of the cab exasperated by the fire his
           son has started by their home.

                          SENIOR
           What the hell are you doin'?!
           Ellis says nothing. He doesn't move. Senior, continuing to
           yell, runs and drags a hose up from the houseboat.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           Ellis dammit! What the hell's
           wrong with you?!
           The fire hisses as Senior turns the hose on it.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           Ellis? Look at me.
           Ellis finally looks up at his father. A phone RINGS from
           inside the houseboat. Senior holds the hose in front of him.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           Take it. Put this damn thing out.

           103.

                         
           Ellis takes the hose as Senior stomps on board to catch the
           phone. Ellis drops the hose.
           Senior's voice, speaking into the telephone, faintly carries
           outside. He's yelling. Ellis turns his head to listen.

           SENIOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           I don't give a shit! Fine! I
           don't care what you do! I'm done
           with it!
           Ellis moves around the fire so he can see the houseboat
           through the flames. He hears the phone SLAM down.
           Senior appears at the back door. He stares at Ellis through
           the fire. Ellis moves to the side but realizes Senior isn't
           staring at him. He's staring at the fire.
           Senior disappears back into the house. There is a commotion.
           Ellis watches as Senior bursts out of the house holding an
           armful of woman's clothes. Senior walks up to the bonfire
           and begins tossing clothes on top piece by piece.

                          ELLIS
           What are you doing?
           Ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in
           the flames.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           Stop it! That's mom's stuff! STOP

           IT!
           Ellis shoves at Senior. He easily counters the boy with his
           arm and continues tossing the clothes into the fire. Ellis
           is screaming and crying.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

           STOP IT! STOP!
           Ellis tries yanking the remaining clothes out of his father's
           hands but Senior shakes him off. Ellis stumbles. He watches
           with tears as Senior tosses all of the clothes on.
           Senior watches his wife's clothes burn. Ellis backs away to
           the bike. He climbs on, cranks the engine and speeds off.

          115 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 115

           Ellis grounds the flat-bottom on shore and jumps out.

          116 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 116

           Ellis thrashes through the woods. His muddy feet stomp
           across the fallen tree trunk that bridges the creek.

           104.

                         

          117 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - DAY 117

           The boat rests on its trailer on the edge of the bank. Mud
           stands on board looking down at the motor. Neckbone, tools
           in hand, has his head buried in the motor.

                          NECKBONE
           Try it now.
           Mud turns a switch. No result.

                          MUD
           Nothin'.

                          NECKBONE
           Sonofabitch.
           Ellis emerges from the treeline. Mud sees him and hops down
           from the boat. He walks up to him.

                          MUD
           What'd she...
           Ellis punches Mud with as much force as he can muster. It's
           barely enough to turn Mud's face, but it stuns him.

                          ELLIS
           You're a liar. Makin' two kids run
           around doin' work you're too scared
           to do yourself. Makin' me tell her
           it's over `cause you're too scared
           to do it yourself.
           Mud steps back and gives the boy his space. Neckbone has
           made his way over and watches from behind Mud.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           You said you loved her and you
           lied. You gave up on her and she
           gave up on you just like everybody
           else. I trusted you. Bonfires and
           crosses. Wolf's eye bullshit.
           Mud tries to approach him but the boy explodes, shoving him.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

           EVERYTHING YOU'VE TOLD ME WAS A
           LIE! You never cared about her.
           You never cared about us. Not like
           you said. Not enough to matter.
           You used us.

                          MUD
           Come on Ellis.
           Mud holds a hand out to him. Ellis slaps it away.

           105.

                         

                          ELLIS
           You made me a thief!
           Ellis walks back into the woods. Mud exhales and turns back
           to Neckbone.

                          NECKBONE
           Let me talk to him.

          118 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 118

           Ellis walks through the woods. Neckbone follows.

                          NECKBONE
           Ellis! Ellis, stop for a second!
           Neckbone watches as Ellis reaches the tree trunk that bridges
           the creek. Ellis steps onto the log, but his muddy shoes
           miss a step. He SLIPS.
           Neckbone sees Ellis disappear down into the creek bed.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)

           ELLIS!
           Neckbone rushes over. He cranes his neck out to peer over
           the edge, a solid eight foot drop into the creek.
           Ellis floats face up in the shallow water. He's unconscious.
           A wound on his head from a nearby rock.
           The nest of WATER MOCCASINS has been disturbed; SNAKES WRITHE

           AROUND ELLIS' BODY.
           Neckbone's eyes widen. He darts back toward the shore.

          119 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - DAY 119

           Mud stands at the rear of the boat massaging his jaw.

           NECKBONE (O.S.)

           MUD! MUD!
           Mud hears the yelling. Neckbone explodes from the trees.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)

           MUD! ELLIS FELL! HE FELL IN THE

           CREEK!
           Mud rushes forward.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)

           HE FELL INTO SNAKES! THE SNAKES!
           Mud stops.

           106.

                         

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)

           MUD PLEASE!
           Mud looks around. His shirt hangs from a tree limb nearby.
           He snags it and darts into the woods.

          120 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 120

           Mud streaks through the woods as he gets his other arm
           through the shirt sleeve. He reaches the creek.
           Without hesitating, Mud leaps down into the water, scoops
           Ellis into his arms and scales up the opposite side of the
           creek bed.
           Mud sprints for the north side of the island. Neckbone
           chases after them.

          121 EXT. NORTHERN SHORE AND RIVER - DAY 121

           Mud cradles Ellis in his arms as he rushes to the flat-bottom
           boat. He sets Ellis gently inside. Neckbone on his heels.
           Mud shoves the boat into the water and hops in. Neckbone
           wades out and crawls up the side of the boat.

                          MUD
           Get the motor started.
           Neckbone cranks the motor. As they move up river, Mud
           searches Ellis' body. He looks at his neck, his arms, he
           pulls up his shirt.

                          NECKBONE
           IS HE OKAY?! Is he bit?!
           Mud notices Ellis' jeans leg riding up. He pulls the jeans
           back. A BITE in the middle of his calf. It's a bluish
           bruise with two distinct red dots. The skin around the bite
           has already begun to swell.

                          MUD
           Shit.
           He rips the jeans up to the thigh. Mud tears a section of
           cloth from the bottom of his own shirt and creates a
           tourniquet just below Ellis' knee.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           What time is it?
           Mud pulls a black Sharpie out of his pocket. Neckbone
           doesn't answer, just stares.

                          MUD (CONT'D)

           WHAT TIME IS IT?!

           107.

                         
           Neckbone checks his watch.

                          NECKBONE
           It's four eighteen!
           Mud draws a line on Ellis' leg just above the swollen bite.
           He writes, "418".

                          MUD
           Yell out every 10 minutes!
           Mud elevates Ellis' leg then gently cups his head. He dabs
           the gash on Ellis' forehead.

                          NECKBONE
           Is he gonna be okay?!

                          MUD
           We just need to get him to a
           clinic! Is there still one in
           town?!

                          NECKBONE
           Yeah!

                          MUD
           It's the closest?!

                          NECKBONE
           Yeah!

                          MUD
           I'm gonna need your bike!

                          NECKBONE
           Are you bit?!
           Mud shakes his head.

                          MUD
           No.
           He holds Ellis as they move steadily up river.

          122 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY 122

           The flat bottom boat approaches the riverbank. Neckbone
           points to the sandy ridge and yells up to Mud.

                          NECKBONE
           My bike should be just over that
           ridge!
           Mud looks at Ellis' leg. The swelling has crept up his
           thigh. Black lines with numbers mark its progress: "428,
           438, 448". Ellis' face has taken on a blue tint.

           108.

                         
           The boat hasn't reached the shore, but Mud takes Ellis in his
           arms and jumps into the water. He wades onto the bank.

          123 AT THE BIKE, 123
           Mud straddles it, turning Ellis' body so they are face to
           face. He cranks the bike and speeds away.
           Neckbone makes it to the top of the ridge in time to see Mud
           disappear into the trees.

          124 EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY 124

           Mud speeds the dirt bike down the two-lane highway. He's far
           too big for the bike and it's even trickier balancing Ellis.
           Coming up on a slow moving pick-up overloaded with junk, Mud
           veers into the opposing lane.

           ONCOMING TRAFFIC.
           Mud darts back to his lane in time to miss a semi.

          125 EXT. CLINIC - DAY 125

           A MALE NURSE(36) wheels an ELDERLY MAN through the sliding
           double front doors of a small clinic.
           Mud appears around the corner. The bike speeding toward the
           entrance.
           In a fluid motion, Mud takes Ellis in his arms and lifts his
           leg over the bike. The bike tilts and slides across the
           pavement, smacking solidly into the curb.
           Mud has managed to stay on his feet with the boy in his arms
           and rushes through the automatic front doors.

          126 INT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS 126

           The reception area has a DOZEN PATIENTS sitting in it. A
           check-in desk to the left. Mud holds Ellis out in his arms.

                          MUD

           I NEED HELP HERE!
           A FEMALE NURSE rushes out of the check-in area.

                          FEMALE NURSE
           Just stay calm. What's going on?

                          MUD
           He's been snake bit.
           ANOTHER NURSE rushes off calling for a doctor. The room
           becomes more frenzied. Patients talking. Nurses shouting.

           109.

                         

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           He's snake bit. A cotton mouth.
           On his calf. Just under an hour.
           As quickly as Mud gets this out, a GROUP of NURSES rush out
           of a door at the end of the room pushing a gurney.
           They take Ellis from Mud's arm, place him on the gurney, and
           speed him into the back of the clinic.
           The commotion gone, the reception area feels oddly still.
           Mud takes a deep breath.
           He looks to his right. Patients stare at him. He's beyond
           disheveled. He's crazy looking.
           Mud turns to his left. The Male Nurse stares at him. For
           the first time, Mud realizes he's out in the open.

                          MALE NURSE
           Sir?
           Mud slowly backs up.

           MALE NURSE (CONT'D)
           Sir? We're gonna need some
           information?
           Mud backs out of the automatic doors. The entire room stares
           at him.

          127 EXT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS 127

           Mud is outside. The glass doors close. He nervously checks
           over his shoulders. He spots a bank of trees just down from
           the clinic. He heads for them.
           The front doors slide open and the Male Nurse walks out.

                          MALE NURSE
           Sir?!
           Mud hops into the bank of trees and disappears.

          128 INT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS 128

           The Patients in the reception area settle back into their
           seats and discuss the commotion.
           The Male Nurse enters and walks behind the check-in window.

           IN THE WINDOW,
           The Male Nurse fingers through a pile of papers.

           110.

                         
           He removes one of the fliers that Carver and his men have
           been showing. The Nurse studies the photo, looking back at
           the front doors.
           He picks up the phone and dials the number at the bottom.

          129 INT. PINES MOTEL - CONTINUOUS 129

           In the adjoining room, the phone rings. King steps through
           the doorway, takes a seat on the bed, and answers.

                          KING
           Hello...Yes...Yessir we are...Uh
           huh.
           King takes a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on a pad
           on the nightstand.

                          KING (CONT'D)
           Now where'd you say you
           were?...Okay...He's gone.
           Okay...But you say he left the
           boy?...And your name sir?

          130 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN - EVENING 130

           The sun has been down for awhile. Juniper leans on the
           railing outside her room taking long drags from a cigarette.
           She sees Miller's green pick-up parked below.
           Suddenly the headlights pop on and the truck pulls away. She
           watches, curious, as it speeds out of sight.
           A train whistle blows in the distance but is overtaken by a
           semi rumbling down the street. She watches the semi pass
           revealing the DAY/NITE Gas Station's parking lot.
          A130 MUD STANDS IN THE CORNER OF THE LOT. Half lit by a sodium A130
           lamp, he stares up at her.
           Juniper raises up. Even in the dim light she knows it's him.
           She doesn't move.
           Mud holds up a hand, waves. Juniper slowly waves back.
           She tries to smile at him, but she's about to cry and it's
           hard to muster.
           Mud smiles. After a long moment, he turns his back and
           disappears in the shadows at the side of the gas station.
           Juniper watches after him.

          131 EXT. BLACK BAYOU - NIGHT 131

           The night sky is dark purple. An unnatural color.

           111.

                         
           Ellis is on his back. Eyes closed. His head jostles at the
           SOUND of THUMPING. More THUMPING. It sounds like the hood
           of a car denting in.
           His eyes open. He stares up at an absurdly full moon. It's
           so bright it totally silhouettes the tree branches overhead.
           The THUMPING continues. Ellis puts his hands on the edge of
           the flat-bottom boat he's floating in and pulls himself up.
           He leans over the side to see what's causing the noise.
           The water is jet black. The entire bayou pulsates. Ellis'
           eyes grow wide as the THUMPING reveals itself.

           THE BAYOU IS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH SNAKES.
           The moonlight illuminates their shiny black backs as they
           twist and churn in what seems like one giant ball of snakes.
           Ellis lies back in the boat bringing his arms close to his
           chest. He flinches at each THUMP. His eyes squeeze shut.

          132 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT 132

           His eyes open. Ellis bolts up in bed covered in a cold
           sweat. Mary Lee places a palm on his chest.

                          MARY LEE
           It's okay. You're okay. Just set
           back.
           Mary Lee guides Ellis back down on the pillow. Senior stands
           with his arm on her shoulder. They look down at their son.

                          ELLIS
           Where am I?

                          MARY LEE
           You're home. We got you home.
           Ellis takes a second to get his bearings. His mother lifts a
           glass of Sprite up to his mouth. He takes a sip.

                          SENIOR
           You had us scared son.
           Senior steps forward and kisses Ellis on the forehead.
           Staying close to his face.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)

                          (WHISPERS)
           I'm so glad you're okay.

                          MARY LEE
           The doctors gave you some medicine.
           You had a snake bite.

           112.

                         

                          ELLIS
           How'd I get to the doctor?

                          MARY LEE
           A man brought you in. No one knew
           him.
           Ellis tries to sit up in bed, but his mother stops him.

           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
           It's okay. You just need to rest
           up now. We can talk all about it
           later. Do you need anything? Are
           you hungry?

                          ELLIS
           No.
           Senior gently pats her shoulders.

                          SENIOR
           Come on. Let's let him rest.
           Mary Lee touches Senior's hand on her shoulder. She stands.

                          MARY LEE
           I'll be back in to check on you but
           just try and sleep if you can.

                          ELLIS
           Okay.
           Senior leads Mary Lee to the door.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           Mom? Dad?
           They turn back.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           I love ya'll.

                          MARY LEE
           We love you too Ellis.
           They exit the room. Ellis rests his head back on the pillow
           and takes a deep breath.

          133 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - NIGHT 133

           Mud and Neckbone shove against the back of the boat trailer.
           The wheels of the trailer rock at the edge of the bank's
           incline. Sheets of metal roofing taken from the shack Ellis
           and Neckbone dismantled line a runway into the water.

           113.

                         

                          MUD

                          (STRAINING)
           Almost there.
          The wheels finally turn over. The trailer rolls down the
          bank and splashes into the water. The boat shimmies.
          Mud and Neckbone follow the trailer into knee deep water and
          shove on the boat. A final push jettisons it into the river.
          They step back as the boat drifts out. A rope tied to its
          back becomes taught as it stretches from a tree on shore.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           The sun does shine on a dog's ass
           some days.

                          NECKBONE
           It ain't sunk yet.
          Mud smiles. He holds out his hand, which Neckbone slaps.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           I wish Ellis could see it.

                          MUD
           I know.
          Mud walks back on shore and collects his duffel bag.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           I owe you your end of the deal.
          Mud removes the pistol from the back of his jeans.
          Neckbone's eyes light up. Mud hands it over and Neckbone
          immediately notices a hole where the clip is missing.

                          NECKBONE
           Where the bullets?

                          MUD
           The deal was for the gun, not the
           bullets.

                          NECKBONE
           Shit.
          Neckbone begrudgingly crams the pistol into the back of his
          pants.

                          MUD
           I got one last favor to ask you.
          Neckbone sucks his teeth.

           114.

                         

          134 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 134

           Water gently laps at the side of Ellis' houseboat. The bayou
           is quiet.
           From the darkness, Neckbone and Mud appear in the flat-bottom
           boat. They paddle with their hands. Approaching in silence.

          135 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT 135

           Ellis stares at the ceiling, unable to sleep. A TAP comes
           from the window. Ellis sits up in bed. Mud pokes his head
           in. He whispers.

                          MUD
           Ellis?

                          ELLIS
           Mud?

                          MUD
           Yeah.
           Mud pulls his body through the window. It's tight but he
           manages to make it look somewhat graceful. Mud takes a quick
           survey of the dark room. Ellis begins to get out of bed.

                          MUD (CONT'D)
           No, don't get up.
           Mud motions him back down and pulls the chair from the desk
           over to the bed. They speak in hushed voices.

                          ELLIS
           How'd you get here?

                          MUD
           Neck brought me.

          136 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 136

           Neckbone sits in the flat-bottom tied off at the corner.

           FROM THE TREELINE ON SHORE,
           All EIGHT of the Bounty Hunters sit hunkered in the trees.
           Carver squats next to a stump. He loads shotgun shells into
           a 12 gauge pump and motions for the others to fan out along
           the bank.

          137 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 137


                          MUD
           We got the boat in the water.

                          ELLIS
           You did?

           115.

                         

                          MUD
           Just now. Smooth sailin' from here
           on out.

                          ELLIS
           Good.

                          MUD
           Wish you coulda seen it.

                          ELLIS
           Me too.

                          MUD
           Didn't feel right leavin' town
           without sayin' goodbye.
          There is an awkward moment.

                          ELLIS
           I'm sorry `bout what I said.

                          MUD
           No. No. You were right to be mad.
           You were right about a lot of
           things. I'm the one that's sorry.
           I shoulda never gotten ya'll into
           all this. I just didn't see any
           other way around it. But I
           couldn't leave without you knowin'
           I never lied about being your
           friend. I never lied about that.

                          ELLIS
           I know.

                          MUD
           I don't traffic in the truth too
           often. But I did love her. I do
           love her.

                          ELLIS
           She loves you too. She said it.
          This fact still strikes Mud. He nods.

                          MUD
           I just made mistakes. We both did.
           This is a hard life to keep up
           with. You can't blame her for
           gettin' tired of tryin'.

                          ELLIS
           My dad says you can't count on
           women lovin' you. He says you
           can't trust it.

           116.

                         

                          MUD
           That's not true. Don't judge your
           life on all of our mistakes.
           You'll make plenty mistakes of your
           own, no need takin' on everybody
           else's. You're a good man Ellis.
           If you find a girl half as good,
           you'll be all right.

                          ELLIS
           You're a good man too Mud.
           Mud smiles.

                          MUD
           No. I'm not. But maybe from here
           on out I can be...
           A SHOTGUN BLAST rips a fist-sized hole in the flimsy interior
           wall. Mud, as if by reflex, yanks Ellis from the sheets and
           shoves him under the bed.

           BOOM. BOOM.
           Bits of sheetrock fall like snow flakes as more holes blast
           through the bedroom wall. Mud flinches with each shot. He
           covers his own head with one hand and the boy with the other.

                          ELLIS
           Mud?!

                          MUD
           Stay put! JUST STAY UNDER THERE!
           The SOUND of shotgun shells being slipped into the chamber.
           Mud gets to a crouch. Through the holes in the wall, Mud
           makes out Nelson, the fat bounty hunter, reloading his gun.

          138 IN THE DEN, 138
           Nelson finishes reloading. The riddled bedroom wall hangs in
           front of him. A door opens behind him. He swivels around.
           Senior, in a robe, rushes from his bedroom with a pistol
           leveled. He's met with a shotgun blast just above his head.
           Pellets nick his face. Senior hits the ground and elbows his
           way back inside his bedroom door.

                          SENIOR

           ELLIS! ELLIS!
           Senior screams, his voice cracking.

          139 IN ELLIS' ROOM, 139

           117.

                         

           SENIOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           (muffled through the wall)

           ELLIS!

                          MUD

                          (WHISPERING)
           Don't move Ellis. Just stay put.
           They just want me.
           Through the holes Mud sees Nelson approaching Ellis' bedroom.
           He runs for the window at the foot of the bed. Another
           shotgun BLAST throws open the door as Mud leaps out.

          140 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 140

           Mud crashes headfirst onto the edge of the houseboat grasping
           for anything to keep from sliding off. His hand catches a
           metal deck cleat. It bends under his weight but holds.
           Mud gets to his feet and is met by the tip of a rifle.
           Miller, the man from the cafe, stands poised to fire.
           Mud's hand slips to the back of his pants for his pistol.
           NOTHING. He looks to the flat-bottom tied at the far edge of
           the boat. No sign of Neckbone.
           Miller's finger curls around the trigger.
           SUDDENLY, a BULLET snicks through Miller's neck.
           Mud flinches. Miller's hand comes up to his neck but can't
           hold the blood running from it. He topples into the water.

          141 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 141

           Tom Blankenship sits in the folding chair on the roof of his
           houseboat. He shucks an empty shell from a HIGH-POWERED
           RIFLE complete with scope. The long suitcase from the photo
           in Tom's house sits open at his feet. It has compartments
           for the disassembled rifle.
           Tom quickly raises to a new firing position. He squints an
           eye, searching for another target.
          A141 From this vantage point, Ellis' houseboat is clearly visible;

                          A141
           partially lit by the two flood lights. FOUR other BOUNTY
           HUNTERS swarm the boat.

          142 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 142

           Still under the bed, Ellis tries to hold his breath as
           Nelson's boots step into the room. They pause for a moment,
           before sluggishly struggling through the bedroom window.

          143 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 143

           Mud rushes to untie the flat-bottom.

           118.

                         
           A BULLET splinters the corner of the dock sending shards of
           wood into Mud's hand. He sees TWO more GUNMEN skirting
           toward him on the deck of the houseboat.
           Mud takes cover against the wall and finds the muzzle of
           Nelson's gun teetering out Ellis' window. He grabs the
           muzzle and yanks the shotgun free.
           Nelson, stuck in the window, looks up in time to take a rifle
           butt in the face. He falls back into the room unconscious.

           NECKBONE (O.S.)

           MUD!

          144 ON THE RIVERBANK, 144
           James, the man with the mustache, holds Neckbone in a
           headlock trying to cover his mouth. Carver stands with his
           shotgun leveled and fires at Mud.

          145 ON THE BOAT, 145
           Mud ducks as Carver's shot takes out a chunk of siding. The
           SOUND of boots rush up the side of the boat.
           Mud, gun in hand, jumps back through Ellis' window.

          146 ON THE RIVERBANK, 146
           Carver turns to Neckbone.

                          CARVER
           Let him go.
           James unhands the boy. Neckbone sprints into the woods.

                          CARVER (CONT'D)
           Come on.
           They move toward the houseboat.

          147 INT. ELLIS' ROOM/HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 147

           Mud gets to his feet, stepping over an unconscious Nelson on
           his way to the bedroom door.

                          MUD
           You still down there bud?

                          ELLIS
           Yeah.

                          MUD
           Stay put.
           Mud pops out of the bedroom into the den.

           119.

                         

          148 IN SENIOR'S BEDROOM, 148
           Mary Lee, curled under the bed, frantically dials the phone.
           Senior, propped against the closed door, uses his undershirt
           to dab the pellet wounds around his neck.
           Hearing footsteps, he cracks the door open. He sees Mud
           standing in the den. Senior cocks his pistol

          149 IN THE DEN, 149
           The front door is KICKED open. Mud dives behind a Lazy Boy
           as a Bounty Hunter fires through the doorway.
           The back of the Lazy Boy explodes in fluff and fabric. Mud
           raises up to return fire, forcing the Man back out the door.
           Mud crouches back behind the Lazy Boy. Unbeknownst to him,
           another MAN appears outside two sliding glass doors. The Man
           raises his rifle at Mud.
           One of Tom's bullets rips through the Man's chest and
           shatters the glass door. Mud flinches. Another Hunter steps
           into the now broken door frame. Mud FIRES the shotgun,
           blowing the man into the patio grill.
          A149 Mud can see Tom's houseboat silhouetted across the A149
           bayou. A muzzle FLASH sparks from the top of Tom's
           boat. This makes Mud smile.
          150 The Front Door kicks open again and more pellets shatter 150
           through the den. Mud raises to return fire.
           ONE SHOT, TWO, the third is a dead CLICK. He drops back
           behind the chair, out of shells.

                         

          151 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 151

           Carver steps across the plank onto the houseboat followed by
           James. Carver motions him around back toward Ellis' window.

                          CARVER
           Flush him out this way.
           Carver walks to the covered carport.

          152 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 152


           IN THE DEN,
           The Hunters at the front door continue taking pot shots at
           the furniture.
           Mud flinches at each new round fired.

          153 IN ELLIS' ROOM, 153

           120.

                         
           Ellis cautiously slides out from under his bed and crouches
           next to the bedroom door. He peeks through a crack.
           He sees Mud pinned behind the Lazy Boy. They make eye
           contact. Mud's eyes move to something behind Ellis.
           Ellis turns to see James passing by his bedroom window.

          154 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 154

           Tom scans Ellis' boat through the scope on his rifle. He
           sees Carver creeping around the carport. He pans right to
           find James taking a position near the patio doors.
           Tom pauses, seeing Ellis appear at the corner of the boat
           just behind James.

          155 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 155

           The firing from the front door has stopped. Mud takes a deep
           breath, sets the empty shotgun on the ground, then rushes out
           the sliding glass doors as the men out front reload.

          156 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/TOM'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 156

           Mud makes it outside, his back to James' leveled rifle.

                          ELLIS

           MUD!
           James and Mud both turn at the sound of Ellis' voice. One of
           Tom's bullets drops James dead.
           Carver appears at the carport end of the boat. He raises his
           shotgun toward Mud.

          A156 ON TOM, A156
           He snaps the bolt open and closed, but it jams. He jerks at
           the lever, looking up he sees Carver taking aim.

          157 ON MUD, 157
           Mud takes a running leap off the side of the boat.
           Carver FIRES.
           Mud is struck in the back by the shotgun blast. The force of
           the shot spins him in the air. He crashes into the water.
           Ellis screams.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

           MUD!
           Carver approaches the edge of the boat. He stares down into
           the swirling dark water. No sign of Mud.

           121.

                         

          A157 ON TOM, A157
           Tom slaps open the bolt and yanks the spent cartridge out
           with his fingers. It BURNS.

                          TOM

           DAMMIT!

           ON CARVER,
           He pumps the shotgun and fires into the murky water. The
           pellets pepper the surface. Still no sign of Mud.
           Carver pumps the shotgun a final time, but before he can get
           another shot off Tom's bullet rips open Carver's chest
           sending him sprawling through the broken patio doors.

           ON TOM,
           He exhales, shucks the bolt once more. His eyes scan the
           dark water.

          158 ON THE HOUSEBOAT, 158
           Ellis runs to the edge of the boat.

                          ELLIS

           MUD! MUD!
           Senior exits the houseboat, pistol pointed. He sees Ellis
           and runs to him.

                          SENIOR

           ELLIS!
           Senior grabs the boy, keeping his pistol up. Ellis drops to
           his knees and Senior crouches with him, holding him tight in
           his arms. Ellis cries.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           It's okay. It's okay.
           The two sit alone on the edge of the houseboat. The river
           seems especially quiet now.

          159 I/E. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 159
           The sky shows faint signs of morning, a few streaks of light.

           ON THE RIVERBANK,
           The blue, red, and white lights from police cruisers and
           ambulances bounce up into the trees.
           A frenzy of Police activity swarms from the aftermath left on
           Ellis' houseboat. Men in wetsuits prepare a dive. Blanket
           covered bodies are wheeled off on gurneys.

           122.

                         
           Two of the Bounty Hunters, unharmed, sit locked in the back
           of a state trooper vehicle.

          160 ON THE HOUSEBOAT, 160
           Ellis, Senior and Mary Lee sit huddled together under the
           carport. They watch the emergency workers stream past.
           Senior wraps his arms around them.
           Ellis looks across the bayou to Tom's boat. Police
           flashlights bob and weave throughout. No sign of Tom.

          161 INSIDE ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT, 161
           A LOCAL OFFICER strings caution tape across the broken patio
           doors. TWO STATE TROOPERS hover over Carver's body.
           The Troopers step away and the Local Officer cranes toward
           the body. He studies Carver's face.
           Stepping aside, the Officer takes a cell phone from his
           pocket and dials. He turns his back away from the Troopers.

          162 INT. PINES MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 162

           The phone rings in the Pines Motel. King enters from the
           adjoining room and takes a seat on the bed. He answers.

                          KING
           Hello...You're speaking to him...
           King listens. His face taut.

                          KING (CONT'D)
           He's dead?
           (a long pause)
           Okay.
           King hangs up the phone. He sits at the edge of the bed,
           overwhelmed by the news.

          163 EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 163

           It's dark on the river. Moonlight barely shows the ripples
           in the slow moving current. MUSIC from a country station
           slips out across the surface of the water.
           Galen's jambox sits next to a small lantern in his flat-
           bottom boat. His Helper snores, fully reclined, with an
           empty can of Budweiser resting on his gut.
           His feet are propped next to a tiny bell rigged to a line
           that disappears into the water. The bell RINGS.

          164 EXT. UNDERWATER - RIVER - NIGHT 164

           The river bed swirls inside two, distinct spots of light.

           123.

                         
           Galen, using his new diving lights, scoops a final mussel
           shell into the net before tying it off. He tugs at the line.
           It's pitch black save for the shafts of light projected from
           Galen's shoulders. He tilts the lights toward the surface.
           The line leading up to the bottom of the boat dances in and
           out of the high beams. Then...

           MUD'S BODY FLOATS BY OVERHEAD.
           Only his backside is visible. A cloud of blood trails from
           the holes there.

           FADE TO BLACK.

          165 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DAY 165

           A WORKER cinches a thick strap across the deck of Ellis'
           houseboat.

          166 ON THE RIVERBANK, 166
           Ellis watches as WORKERS affix straps from his houseboat to a
           crane resting in the bed of a large truck on the bank.
           The SOUND of Neckbone's dirt bike rattles through the trees.
           He appears behind Ellis and parks.

                          NECKBONE
           Hey.

                          ELLIS
           You got your bike back.

                          NECKBONE
           Mud dinged the shit out of it.
           Neckbone takes a seat next to Ellis. They watch the workers.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           They're really doin' it.

                          ELLIS
           It's the law.

                          NECKBONE
           It's bullshit. They ever find Tom?
           The boys focus on Tom Blankenship's boat across the bayou.
           It sits vacant, covered in police tape.

                          ELLIS
           No. He's gone.

                          NECKBONE
           Your dad not here?

           124.

                         

                          ELLIS
           Said he couldn't watch it. He's
           pickin' me up in a minute. Got
           deliveries today.
           They sit in silence as the Workers exit off the houseboat.

                          NECKBONE
           Heard on the news. They still
           hadn't found Mud's body.
           Ellis nods.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           You think he's dead?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know. I hope not.
           The crane begins lifting up the houseboat. The metal wires
           tighten and the entire structure creaks.
           A sucking sound as the flotilla separate from the water. The
           boat hangs, suspended in the air.
           A HORN HONKS behind the boys. Ellis turns to see Senior's
           truck.

                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
           I gotta go. Come by the apartment.
           Help me set my room up.

                          NECKBONE
           All right.
           Neckbone watches Ellis climb into the bed of the pick-up and
           take his spot on the coolers. The sound of twisting metal
           shifts his attention back to the houseboat being swung over a
           flatbed semi.

          167 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 167

           IN THE CAB,
           Senior glances at the houseboat being set on the flatbed. He
           puts the truck in reverse and pulls away. Not looking back.

          168 EXT. SENIOR'S TRUCK/IMAGES OF DEWITT - DAY 168

           Ellis rides in the back of the truck on top of the
           coolers. He watches the town pass by.
          A168 The marina junkyard. The Sonic. Downtown. A168

           125.

                         

          B168 EXT. FLEA MARKET - DAY B168

           Ellis and his father unload a cooler at the back of a tented
           flea market. A WOMAN comes out to greet them.

          169 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/NEW APARTMENTS - DAY 169
           Senior's truck pulls into the parking lot of a newly finished
           apartment complex. The two-story buildings are modest.
           The truck idles out front.

           INSIDE THE CAB,
           Ellis grabs the door handle. He turns to Senior.

                          ELLIS
           I'll see you next week?

                          SENIOR
           Yeah.
           Ellis begins to get out but stops when Senior speaks.

                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
           Ellis? You mind your mother okay?
           This is a big change for her. She
           needs your support.

                          ELLIS
           Yessir.

                          SENIOR
           All right. I love you.

                          ELLIS
           Love you too.

           Ellis climbs out. He watches as Senior pulls away.
           He stands alone in front of the apartments, studying the
           surroundings. A busy road out front. A gas station and
           collection of stores. A lot of people and commotion.
           A compact car pulls into a parking spot one building down.

           Ellis watches as three COLLEGE AGE GIRLS climb out dressed in
           running shorts and t-shirts. Two are heavy set, the other is
           petite. They joke and laugh. One sees Ellis and waves.
           Ellis nods to her. He tracks them as they walk inside.
           Ellis smirks.

          170 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY 170

           The river rushes past. A large motor churns the water.

           126.

                         
           Tom stands steering Mud's salvaged boat down river. He
           cranes his neck, seeing something up ahead.
           Tom kills the motor. Looking out over the bow, he's pleased
           by what he sees. His eyes glint, almost a smile. He walks
           to the small cabin and enters.

          171 INSIDE THE CABIN, 171
           Mud rests flat on his stomach on the cushioned bench.
           Shirtless, gauze bandages wrap around his chest and back.
           He's sleeping.
           Tom walks in and kneels next to him. Touches his shoulder.
           Mud's eyes open.

                          TOM
           Come on son. You need to see this.
           Mud, groggy, raises up. Tom helps him to his feet, putting
           an arm over his shoulders. Tom practically carries Mud
           outside.

          172 ON DECK, 172
           Tom and Mud slowly maneuver out the door and take a place
           near the front of the boat.
           Mud pulls his head up. Looks out ahead. The sight in front
           of him grabs his attention. He perks up.
           A tributary from the Mississippi river opens up into a vast
           stretch of ocean.
           Mud smiles, showing the missing tooth.
           Tom and Mud stand on deck as their boat drifts slowly into
           the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
           The End.

EXT.  NIGHT - HOLLYWOOD HILLS, LOS ANGELES
    
Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit. The words on the sign
read... "Mulholland Drive." The car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. NIGHT - MULHOLLAND DRIVE
    
Gliding we follow the car - an older black Cadillac limousine
- as it winds its way up Mulholland Drive through the
darkness of the Hollywood Hills. There is no one else on the
road. As we drift closer to the car...
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
    
Two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat. A
beautiful, younger, dark-haired woman sits in back. She sits
close up against the door and stares out into the darkness.
She seems to be thinking about something. Suddenly she turns
and looks ahead. The car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		What are you doing? You don't stop
		here ...
    
The car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind
curve. Both men turn to the woman.
    
				DRIVER
		Get out of the car.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT.  FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
    
Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
    

    
The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. EXT. - CADILLAC LIMOUSINE
    
The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets
up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below. She clumsily starts down toward it.
   
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
Franklin Avenue. A car races by and its headlights flare on
her face. Her expression shows fear and panic. She doesn't
know where she is or where to go. She runs frantically across
the street. She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard. Coming up Sunset in the
distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going.
She hurries into the darkness of another residential area. A
car turns onto the street and comes toward her. She
instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes.
  
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street. A drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her. She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building. The couple passes by without
noticing her. Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.
   
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE   - NIGHT
    
Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives,
HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40's to 50), stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They
do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a
long moment.
  
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		You feel it?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah.
    
They continue to stare.
    
 
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along
		the shoulder ... man up the road said he
		saw two cars drag racin'...then you got
		that blind corner.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		The boys found this on the floor in back
		of the Caddy.
    
Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Yeah, they showed me
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Could be unrelated.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Could be...any of those dead kids wearin'
		pearl earrings?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		That's what I'm thinkin'.
    
Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
He looks out and wonders.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - EARLY DAWN
    
The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open. The cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate. The woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building. She sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage.

    
They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat. Their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN
    
The woman comes into a living room where a single trunk
remains. She goes further into the apartment and crouches
down in a back corner of the kitchen. She listens as
footsteps come across the courtyard. She hears the red-headed
woman and the cab driver get the trunk. She hears them set it
down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-
headed woman walks right past her, grabs a set of keys off
the kitchen counter, then leaves the apartment. The woman can
hear the door being locked. She lets go, slides to the
kitchen floor, and passes out.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT , HOLLYWOOD - MORNING
    
Two well-dressed men HERB and DAN (mid 30's) are sitting at a
table drinking coffee. Herb has finished eating his
breakfast, but Dan hasn't touched his bacon and eggs - he
appears too nervous to eat. A blonde waitress with a
nameplate saying "DIANE" lays the check on their table
smiles, then walks off.
    
				HERB
		Why did you want to go to breakfast if
		you're not hungry?

				DAN
		I just wanted to come here.

				HERB
		To Denny's? I wasn't going to say
		anything, but why Denny's?
    
				DAN
		This Denny's.
    
				HERB
		Okay. Why this Denny's?
    
    
				DAN
		It's kind of embarrassing but,
    
				HERB
		Go ahead.
    
				DAN
		I had a dream about this place.
    
				HERB
		Oh boy.
    
				DAN
		You see what I mean...
    
				HERB
		Okay, so you had a dream about this
		place. Tell me.
    
				DAN
		Well ... it's the second one I've had, but
		they were both the same......they start
		out that I'm in here but it's not day or
		night. It's kinda half night, but it
		looks just like this except for the
		light, but I'm scared like I can't tell
		ya. Of all people you're standing right
		over there by that counter. You're in
		both dreams and you're scared. I get
		even more frightened when I see how
		afraid you are and then I realize what it
		is - there's a man...in back of this
		place. He's the one ... he's the one
		that's doing it. I can see him through
		the wall. I can see his face and I hope
		I never see that face ever outside a
		dream.
    
Herb stares at Dan to see if he will continue. Dan looks
around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.
    
				DAN (cont'd)
		That's it.
    
				HERB
		So, you came to see if he's out there?

				DAN
		To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
    
				HERB
		Right then.

    
Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to
pay. Dan just sits.
    
As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.
Herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with
the cashier. He motions for Dan to follow him. Dan rises
reluctantly and he and Herb make their way outside.

Now Herb waits for Dan to lead the way.
    
				DAN
		Around here.
    
Dan takes Herb across the front of Denny's to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back.
    
They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone. Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.
    
CLOSER ON DAN
    
Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
    
The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
    
Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
    
Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
    
Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.
    
				HERB
		Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!
    
He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse
in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.

		My God!

A blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us. As the
blonde's face fills the screen we move with her and stay with
her as she goes. Her face is bright and her eyes move here
and there taking in everything. She can hardly believe she's
in Los Angeles - the City of Dreams. She and the old woman
pass under a sign which reads "WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES."
The girl smiles and looks around excited by every detail.

The girl and the old lady exit the terminal with their bags.
An older gentleman has joined the old lady. They stop at the
taxicab stand. The old lady takes the blonde girl's hand.
    
				OLD LADY
		It's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's
		been so nice travelling with you.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and
		nervous. It was sure great to have you
		to talk to.
    
				IRENE
		Now, remember I'll be watching for you on

				BETTY
			(smiling)
		Okay Irene. Won't that be the day.

				IRENE
		The best of luck to you, Betty. Take
		care of yourself and be careful.

    
				BETTY
		Okay I will. Thanks again.
    
Betty and Irene give each other a hug. The old gentleman nods
to Betty and takes Irene off. Betty smiles after them.
Suddenly someone is grabbing her bags. She turns abruptly to
find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. She turns
once more and waves at Irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.
    
				CAB DRIVER
		Where to?
    
				BETTY
			(smiling excitedly)
		1612 Havenhurst.

		Got it!
    
They get into the cab and close their doors. The cab pulls
away.

EXT. STREETS - LOS ANGELES - DAY
    
Betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. Each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega,
Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire
Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn
right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst
and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. 1612 HAVENHURST
    
The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell.

    
An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
    
				MANAGER
		Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.

				BETTY
		I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois
		isn't it?
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		In all my living glory, baby.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		You can call me Coco ... everybody does.
		Stay there, I'll get the key.
    
				BETTY
		Okay, Coco.
    
Coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. She starts off into the
courtyard and Betty picks up her bags and follows. As Coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
    
				COCO
		I guess it was your grandfather, was
		it ... he called me to check in, said you
		were on your way and for you to call when
		you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
    
				BETTY
		Yes, he is. He raises corn.
    
				COCO
		Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood
		these days too.
    
				BETTY
		Well, I ...
    
				COCO
		You don't have to tell me. It's written
		all over that pretty face of yours.. You
		came here to be an actress. I just hope
		you'll remember there's never been a
		great poem called "tits and ass."
    
    
				BETTY
		I...
    
				COCO
		You probably don't remember her, but
		Louise Bonner lives right over there in
		number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs
		a damn good acting class.
    
				BETTY
		Have many famous actors and actresses
		lived here? I was meaning to ask you
		that.
    
				COCO
		Honey, all the great ones came through
		here at one time or another.
    
A haunting music begins to swell.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
    
		People say in the springtime when the
		wind blows the smell of the jasmine you
		can still feel the presence of everyone
		of them.
    
				BETTY
		I guess I've come to quite a place.
    
				COCO
		Sweetheart, you don't know the half of
		it.
    
The music fades.
    
Coco looks down suddenly. On the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
			(yelling up)
		WILKINS! ... (no answer) ... THAT DOG CRAPS

Coco turns back to Betty.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
		You don't have pets do you?

    
				BETTY
		No, I don't.
    
				COCO
		That's good. They're allowed, but I
		don't like 'em...for obvious reasons.
		One man used to live here that had a
		prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't

The dirty and torn black cocktail dress of the dark-haired
woman along with her shoes, purse and undergarments are in a
pile in the bedroom. We drift off them toward the bathroom
where the dark-haired woman can be seen showering through
rippled glass. There's the sound of a door opening. We see a
movement through the glass and the shower goes off instantly.
We can hear the dark-haired woman's frightened breathing as
she waits frozen listening.

Betty enters, thrilled with what she sees. The apartment is

				BETTY
		It's unbelievable!
    
				COCO
		I told ya.
    
				BETTY
		Wow!
    
				COCO
		Now I guess you and your Aunt have an
		understanding. So here's the key and you
		need anything, just give a holler.
			(Coco hands Betty the key)
		Everybody in this building's pretty much
		okay with me or they wouldn't be here.
		If you want, later I'll introduce you
		around. No hard feelings if you don't,
		and don't forget the rooftop garden.
		It's just up the stairs we passed. It's
		open to all the tenants. You can see the
		Hollywood sign from there.
    
				BETTY
		Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

				COCO
		You got it! See you later honey.
    
Coco leaves and closes the door behind her. Betty begins to
explore the apartment.- After walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. She moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. She goes into the
bedroom. She smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. She notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. She
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling
tiles. As she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in
the mirror above it. Suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. There before her is the naked,
beautiful dark-haired woman.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my!
    
She quickly closes the shower door.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I'm sorry. My Aunt ... Ruth didn't tell
		me someone was going to be here. I'm so
		sorry.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		That's okay.
    
				BETTY
		I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm

There's a silence.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		There was an accident. I came here.

				BETTY
		I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm
		sorry.   Are you all right?

    
There is another silence.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What happened?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		A car ... a car accident.
    
				BETTY
		Are you okay?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		I think so. I was just taking a shower.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get
		back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
    
Betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she
stops and looks back in.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What's your name?
    
We see a close-up of the dark-haired woman. We see her eyes
widen with a kind of fear. She's frantically thinking -
searching her mind for an answer.

		I'm sorry. I'll get out of here and we
		can talk later.

				BETTY
		She sure is. She's letting me stay here
		while she's working on a movie that's
		being made in Canada, but I guess you
		know that.  I couldn't afford a place
		like this in a million years. Unless of
		course I'm discovered and become a movie
		star. Of course, I'd rather be known as
		a great actress than a movie star, but
		sometimes people end up being both and
		that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I

Rita motions to her head above her forehead. Betty looks
through her hair and finds her wound which has stopped
bleeding but is surrounded by a very large blue black
bruising.

		We should get a doctor.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
				BETTY
		But, this could be serious.

				RITA
		No...I need to sleep.
    
				BETTY
		If you have a concussion you shouldn't
		sleep.
    
				RITA
		It will be okay if I sleep. I need to
		lie down and sleep.

				BETTY
		All right, but...I'm going to check on
		you.
    
Rita lies down and is instantly asleep. Betty leans over her
and listens to her breathing. She gets a blanket and drapes
it over the beautiful sleeping Rita, then leaves the room.

The street level of the office building is filthy and houses

INT. OFFICE ON SIXTH FLOOR
    
Two men are in the room, JOE and ED. Joe leans up against a
rack of filing cabinets. He is in his late twenties. He
looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker - wears a blue
denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
    
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.
    
				JOE
		So man, that's unheard of ... an accident
		like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
    
				ED
		Unreal ... so, you're looking good.
		Whatcha doin' these days?
    
				JOE
		Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff
		for this guy.
    
				ED
		Making ends meet, huh.
    
				JOE
		Hardly.
    
				ED
		Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
    
				JOE
		Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope
		you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
    
				ED
		It was just a thing. The story made you
		laugh.
    
				JOE
		Yeah, that's a funny story.
    
Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the
desk - to a small worn black book.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		So, there it is ... Ed's famous black book.

    
				ED
		Yeah, the history of the world in phone
		numbers.
    
Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view
holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
scream.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh...man!
    
With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		Hey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
		and use the phone. Help me out. You
		gotta call the hospital.
    
The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
seeing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		I mean it! Get down here quick! She's
		hurt and I can't do everything myself,
		man.

    
Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		No, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
    
He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh ... man!
    
Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.
    
				VOICES
		What the hell .... what happened? What's
		this cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
		It's the vacuum what did it.
    
Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

hand shake, but when he offers his hand it is not taken. The
men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and
without acknowledging anyone. One of the men in a dark suit
opens a briefcase. Ray has been trying to make
introductions.
    
				RAY
		Ah... the Castigliane brothers. Let me

The Castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this,
however, during the introductions the one with the briefcase
removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of Ray.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Ah... she's very pretty.
    
We see the photo of the girl - of a nice looking blonde -
someone we've never seen before. Adam looks like he doesn't
know what's going on and he's getting upset about not
knowing. His manager, Robert Smith, is beginning to see the
makings of a confrontation - he's starting to panic.

Ray, still standing with a forced smile, turns to the
Castigliane brothers.
    
				RAY
		We'd be happy to put her in the pile for

				ESPRESSO MAN
			(leading forward to hear)
		Pardon?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
		Of course. Excuse me.
    
The Espresso Man leaves the room. Luigi looks at the
espresso. Vincenzo stares at Adam.
    
Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo. The Espresso
man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the
espresso.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN (cont'd)
		Will that be all, Sir?
    
Luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very
still waiting, the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room.
    
Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the
espresso cup. He looks around at Ray and Mr. Darby - seeing
them stare at the espresso cup.
    
Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam.
    
Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand.
With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it
above the napkin. He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth.
He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso
to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in
that position for a moment.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Is shit!
    
Luigi Castigliane stands up.
    
				RAY
		I'm sorry. That was a highly
		recommended...
    
				MR. DARBY
		That's considered one of the finest
		espressos in the world , Sir.
    
Luigi just stands there. A small thread on his left suit
jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back
into the fabric. Vincenzo closes his briefcase, takes out a
hankerchief and cleans his nose - then stands, placing the
handkerchief back in his pocket.
    
				ADAM
		Wait a minute!! What's going on here?
    
Vincenzo just stares toward Adam as if he's not even there.
    
				ADAM
		There's no way that girl is in my movie!
    
Silence.

    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		That is the girl.
    
The Castigliane brothers begin to leave. Adam stands up
trembling with anger.
    
				ADAM
		Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		It is no longer your film.
    
Adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in. The
Castigliane brothers leave. As the big blonde wood doors
close behind them Adam starts to boil.
    
				ADAM
			(screaming)
		You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
    
				RAY
		I'll speak to someone.
    
				ADAM
			(turning to his manager)
		And you'd better speak to someone
		too ... or find yourself another client!!
		This smells like a set-up to me!
			(back to Ray)
		And by the way, Ray, I don't know who
		these guys are kidding, but every foot of
		film I've shot is in a vault at the lab
		that only I can access. No one's getting
		that film!!
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		This is a catastrophe...
			(turning toward Ray)
		you told me they might insist on a girl,
		that's all.
    
				ADAM
		Why didn't you tell me, Robert? That's
		what I mean ... you set me up! I woulda
		never come here.
			(standing)
		I'm leaving. I'm a director you don't
		want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!
    
Adam storms out of the room.

Adam exits the building carrying his 7-iron. An attendant
takes his valet parking ticket. While Adam, still fuming,
waits for his car he notices the big limo standing off to one
side. He stares at the car and the huge limo driver leaning
up against the front driver's side door.
    
Adam's car arrives - a late model Porsche. Before Adam gets
into his car he addresses the attendant.
    
				ADAM
		Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
		that limo?
    
				ATTENDANT
		They two guys in dark suits?
    
Adam nods and walks over to the limo. The limo driver eyes
him and his 7-iron suspiciously.
    
				ADAM
		Castigliane brothers?
    
				LIMO DRIVER
		Beat it!
    
				ADAM
		O.K.
    
Adam raises his 7-iron and smashes out the limo's windshield.
He whacks two big dents in the hood, then smashes out a
headlight. The limo driver starts towards him. Adam laughs,
runs to his car and takes off.

INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - LATER DAY
    
Betty is stretched out on the big leather couch in the living
room. A half eaten sandwich and chips are on a plate on the
coffee table next to her. She is talking on the phone.

    
				BETTY
		No Grandpa, you wouldn't believe it.
		It's more beautiful than I ever
		dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food.
		The refrigerator's full ... Aunt Ruthie
		said she'd call me when she got
		settled... it was real smooth. I sat next
		to a lady who gave up her first class
		seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was
		so nice to me. She invited me to her
		house sometime. It's in Bel Air which is
		a place where people have a lot of
		money... I will. Everybody's telling me
		to be careful, but I sure love it here
		Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get
		here ... yeah, it's long distance. I love
		you. Say hello to Grams. Give her a big
		kiss for me. Okay, I love you
		Grandpa ... bye.
    
Betty hangs up the phone, takes a big bite of her sandwich
and lays flat out on the couch, chewing and smiling up at the
ceiling. She suddenly remembers Rita and her promise to look
in on her. She gets off the couch and goes into the bedroom.

INT. - EXT. APARTMENT - DAY
    
Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
    
Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee.
The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. The phone inside rings. Betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. She crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.
    
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Hello ... Aunt Ruth!! I can't tell you how
		happy I am. Your place is so fantastic!
		Yes ... Coco...what a character. I really
		like her... that's too bad...waiting in an
		airport must not be too fun. What's a
		mosquito plane? ... Oh I get it. How long
		does that take from Montreal? ... Well,
		you'll sleep good tonight ... Hudson Bay
		sounds beautiful ...oh well, I hope you
		packed your coat. (laughs). You mean
		the audition...Wally Brown... she didn't
		mention it but he'll fax the dialogue to
		Coco? Suddenly I'm so nervous ... okay
		Aunt Ruth... I'll try. I'll study those
		lines until I know them inside out.
		Yes, either right here on this fabulous
		leather couch or I'll take them with a
		coffee in the courtyard like a regular
		movie star. (laughs). Oh! I got a real
		shock to find your friend Rita here. She
		was in the shower and I opened the
		door ... Rita ... what do you mean? She was
		in an accident ... your friend Rita. No,
		Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't
		see her. She's sleeping. No... she's
		very nice. I'm sure there's some
		explanation, Aunt Ruth... I don't think we
		have to do that. Please don't worry.
		I'll take care of it. No, I'll let you
		know. Where can I ... okay I'll get it
		from Coco.
		No, please don't worry... thank you so
		much for letting me stay here. You've
		made me so happy... thank you, thank you.
		Please don't worry... Aunt Ruth we don't
		need the police. I'll call you when you
		get to Hudson Bay. Please...
		please ... Goodbye Aunt Ruth.
    
Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. She sits for a
moment listening. Silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. As she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. Rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. Betty goes into the bedroom. Rita looks up
at her with desperation.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You're awake... I think I misunderstood
		you. I thought you knew my Aunt and
		that's why you were here. I just talked
		to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me
		to call the police.

    
Rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with
her hands.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Rita?
    
				RITA
			(crying harder)
		I'm... sorry. I ...

Betty's heart softens.
    
				BETTY
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(still sobbing)
		I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke
		up... I thought sleep would do it ...
    
Betty kneels down in front of her.
    
				BETTY
		What's wrong?
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I don't know who I am.
    
				BETTY
		What do you mean? You're Rita.
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I'm not. I don't know what my name is.
		I don't know who I am!!
    
Betty looks down at the purse next to Rita's dress. She picks
it up and hands it to Rita.
    
				BETTY
		This is your purse. Your name must be in
		your purse.
    
Rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. She hesitates.
Something is worrying her. She looks at Betty for help.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You want to know don't you?
    
				RITA
		I ... yes, but ... I ...

    
				BETTY
		Open it!
    
Rita slowly unzips the purse. The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
    
Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.
    
Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of horror.
(note: This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)

INTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
Ray crosses a carpeted closed area. He mounts a flight of
stairs. At the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. Ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. At the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. Again Ray punches in a code. The elevator opens and
Ray goes in. The elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. Ray waits. Finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
		Who is it please?
    
				RAY
		Raymond Harris ... 20743.
    
The elevator begins to move up. When it stops, the door opens
and Ray walks into a windowless reception area where a
beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
			(very quietly)
		You may go right in, Ray.
    
Ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. The
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. Heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
    
    
Ray enters and the doors close behind him. Ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
    
				RAY
		Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced
		Rowk).
    
Mr. Roque stares at Ray silently.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Do you want him replaced?
    
Mr. Roque continues to stare.
    
				RAY
		I know they said...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Then?
    
				RAY
		Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but
		that means we should ...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
				RAY
		Shut everything down ... Is that something
		that...do you want us to shut everything
		down?
    
Silence. Ray doesn't know what to do. He struggles to
interpret Mr. Roque's silence. He waits. Mr. Roque does
nothing but stare.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Then we'll shut everything down.
    
Silence.
    
Ray turns. The doors open as he approaches them and he
leaves the room. The doors close.

health. Her hair is long and stringy. She's wearing a
tight, short sleeve blue sweater, black jeans and boots.
    
				BILLY
		Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

				JOE
		No, no, no, I told you. They're fine.
		They're all real happy.

EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - BEL AIR
    
Adam pulls into his driveway, but is blocked from entering
the garage by a poolman's truck. He gets out of the car and
looks at the truck - sees the insignia on the door which is a
blue square with the word "Gene" above and the word "Clean"
below. Adam hears steps behind him and turns. A JAPANESE
GARDENER is coming toward him smiling and bowing.
    
				JAPANESE GARDENER
		Ah, Mister ... you remember me. I am Taka.
		your gardener. For long time I not see
		you. I pleased to see you.
    
Taka reaches out his hand and Adam shakes it.
    
				ADAM
		Hello Taka. It's 'cause I'm never home
		in the day time. It's good to see you
		again. The garden looks great.
    
Taka bows, smiling and nodding, and goes back to work. Adam
heads toward the front door of his house.

INT. - ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY
    
Adam enters, puts his 7-iron in his golf bag just inside the
door, then looks around. He can see the pool through a wall
of plate glass windows, but there is no one visible poolside.
    
				ADAM
			(calling out)
		Lorraine...
			(then louder)
		Lorraine ... you home?
    
He hears a noise, something falling. He walks in the
direction of the noise. It leads him to his bedroom. His
expression darkens as he approaches the closed door. He
hears voices as he throws the door open.
    
LORRAINE and the poolman GENE are in bed.
    
				LORRAINE
		Now, you've done it!
    
				GENE
		Just forget you ever saw it. It's better
		that way.
    
				LORRAINE
		What the hell are you even doing here?
    
Adam stands stunned for a moment. Then finds himself walking
over to the dresser and opening the top drawer. He removes a
large case.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		What are you doing?
    
Adam starts walking out of the bedroom with the case.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		THAT'S MY JEWELRY!!!
    
Adam leaves the bedroom and starts through the house. He
goes into the kitchen and looks around - numb but trying to
think.

INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
    
Adam leaves the kitchen and goes out into the garage. He
turns on the light and looks around. He spots some paint
cans on a shelf and grabs one and goes back into the kitchen.
He can hear Lorraine calling his name. She seems to be
coming closer. He sets the jewelry case and the paint can on
the floor, kneels down and opens the paint can with his car
key. Just as Lorraine enters the kitchen, he opens the
jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of Hot Pink
paint into her jewelry case.
    
				LORRAINE
		WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???
    
He puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them
about. Lorraine rushes toward him.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		STOP IT!!!
    
Lorraine grabs hold of him. Starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. She tears his jacket. Adam stands all at
once and with his wet Hot Pink hands he pushes Lorraine and
slams her into the kitchen counter just as Gene the poolman
enters. Gene grabs ahold of Adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into Adam's face.
    
				GENE
		That's not a way to treat your wife,
		buddy. I don't care what she's done.
    
Adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries
to hit Gene. Gene blocks his punch and slams Adam again,
knocking him down to the kitchen floor where he lands and
spills the jewelry case. Adam, now covered with paint, is
picked up by Gene and thrown out toward the front door.
    
				LORRAINE
		Throw him out!
    
Lorraine opens the front door while Gene picks Adam up, moves
him across the carpet and heaves him out onto the front lawn.
Lorraine slams the door behind him.
    
Adam picks himself up, severely dazed and bleeding pretty
badly, he heads for his car.

    
Taka stops gardening and smiles and bows at Adam as he gets
into his car.
    
Adam drives away - pink paint and red blood all over.

picks it up and looks questioningly at Betty.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		No ... you shouldn't take that. Let's hide
		it.
    
They look around the room... There's a hatbox in the closet
above the clothes rack. Betty brings it down, takes out the
hat, and Rita puts the purse inside. Betty puts the hat over
the purse in the hatbox and puts in back in the closet.
Betty puts out her hand. Rita looks at it for a moment,
smiles, and they shake.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
    
Betty and Rita walk along. Birds are chirping in the trees
which line both sides of the street. Betty is smiling and
once again looking around at everything. Her good mood and
excitement about life lifts Rita's spirits.
    
Coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. The boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. As the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk Betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.

    
After they pass each other Betty turns back and sees the boy
and the woman enter 1612 Havenhurst. Betty and Rita continue
up the street.

PAYPHONE ON RED BRICK WALL - DAY
    
We see the red brick building. It is Denny's. Betty and
Rita are walking to the payphone. Betty digs out some change
from her purse. She picks up the receiver, drops in a
quarter and dials the "0" for Operator. An Operator answers.
    
				BETTY
		Hollywood Police Department please.
    
				OPERATOR
		Is this an emergency?
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I just want the number.
    
				OPERATOR
		Hold for the number.
    
Betty gets the number for the Hollywood Police Station, re-
deposits the quarter and dials.

				BETTY
		I'm inquiring about an accident that
		happened last night on Mulholland Drive.

Betty holds.

		Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a
		sound last night that sounded like a car
		crash and I want to know if there was an

				SERGEANT BAXTER
		Yes, there was.
    
				BETTY
		Can you tell me what happened?
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		No. I can't.
    
				BETTY
		Was anyone hurt?
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		May I have your name please?
    
Betty hangs up. She turns to Rita smiling like a girl who's
done something bad and gotten away with it.
    
				BETTY
		There was an accident. He wouldn't tell
		me anything else, but that was your
		accident Rita. I just know it was.
		Maybe there's something about it in the

INT.- DENNY'S - DAY
    
Rita and Betty are seated next to the table where Dan and
Herb sat earlier in the day. They both have a cup of coffee
in front of them. Betty has a newspaper open and she is
scanning the last pages.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe it happened so late it's not going
		to be in today's paper.
    
				RITA
		There's nothing?
    
				BETTY
		Not that I can see.

    
The same waitress - Diane, comes up to the girl's table and
freshens up their coffee. Betty looks up and smiles, sees
Diane's nameplate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Thank you ... Diane.
    
Rita shoots a look from Betty to Diane to the nameplate.

				DIANE
		You're welcome. Will that be all? You

				BETTY
		Just the coffee. Rita, you want
		something?
    
				RITA
			(still staring at the nameplate
			- thinking)
		No. Just the coffee.
    
				BETTY
		We'll take our check.
    
Diane searches through her many checks to find Betty and
Rita's.
    
The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue
dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the
manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her
eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes
out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's
check as she places it on their table. She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty
noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the
woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then
leaving.

    
The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her
pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the
manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she
goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense
and lost in a thought.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(without moving a muscle)
		Shhhh.
    
At that moment Diane the waitress reappears at their table.
Diane looks Betty in the eye and while looking at Betty her
left hand slides the Mont Blanc out from under the check and
back into her pocket.
    
				DIANE
		Thank you. Come in again.
    
Betty holds her gaze.
    
				BETTY
		You're welcome. We will.
    
Relieved Diane leaves and goes about her business. Betty
looks over at Rita waiting for her to tell her something.
Rita slowly turns and focuses on Betty.

AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
    
Betty and Rita are sitting next to each other on the leather
couch. Betty is rifling through the phone book. She finds
the listings for Selwyn. Her finger drifts down and finds D.
Selwyn followed by an address and phone number. It is the
only Selwyn with a D. first name. She hands the phone to
Rita.
    
				BETTY
		Strange to be calling yourself.
    
				RITA
		Maybe it's not me.
    
				BETTY
		Call the number.
    
Betty reads the number off and Rita pushes the corresponding
buttons. Each tone seems to be louder than the last. The
ringing seems deafening. There's a click and the phone is
answered - by a machine. A woman's voice is heard - loudly.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(coming from answering machine)
		Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message.
    
Betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also -
straining to hear everything. The machine starts recording.
Betty hangs up the phone immediately.
    
				RITA
		It's not my voice ... but I know her.
    
				BETTY
		Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn.
		Maybe that's your roommate or if it is

TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking
down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front
door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back.
    
Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers.
Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is
on her face and clothes.
    
				KENNY
		Adam Kesher...he...
    
				LORRAINE
		Yeah, right ... get lost!
    
She slams the door, but Kenny's foot stops it and pushes it
back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open
once again. Kenny enters the house.
    
				KENNY
		This is Adam Kesher's house. Where...
    
				LORRAINE
		Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!!
    
Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with
pink paint.
    
				GENE
		I guess you don't understand English.
		She asked to leave. Here's the door.
    
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door.
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.

    
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -
spilling out onto the kitchen floor. Finishing his work with
the vintage golf clubs - Kenny leaves.

Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon
road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area
gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a
dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in
a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No
one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling
stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from
the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the
brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light
is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled
unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red
embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string
tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The
Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front
of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.

		person who does not care about the good
		life.
    
				ADAM
		How's that?

    
				COWBOY
		Well, just stop for a little second and
		think about it. Will ya do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Okay, I'm thinking.
    
				COWBOY
		No. You're too busy being a smart aleck
		to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think
		and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya
		do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Look ... where's this going? What do you
		want me to do?
    
				COWBOY
		There's sometimes a buggy. How many
		drivers does a buggy have?
    
				ADAM
		One.
    
				COWBOY
		So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy
		and you fix your attitude and you can
		ride along with me.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
				COWBOY
		Now I know a few things. I know you have
		had a rough day. You're probably thinkin'
		I don't know the half of it, but in
		actual fact I know every part of it. The
		business of gittin' thrown off your
		movie, the heartache of seeing your wife
		with another man... losin' access to that
		precious film vault...
    
Adam suddenly looks stunned, unsure.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		... realizin' you don't have hardly a
		nickel to your name and then add on to
		that the sickenin' feeling some men are
		gonna catch you and hurt you bad for
		bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like
		that. They are rough, but what will
		tomorrow bring? Will it be better than
		today? The same ... or worse?
		A lot of that is up to us individually.
		Up to us and our attitude. When the
		Castigliane brothers said "This is no
		longer your film," they meant it, but
		they didn't mean you were not going to
		direct it. I want you to go back to work
		tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
		actress anyway ... audition many girls for
		the part. When you see the girl that was
		shown to you earlier today, you will say
		" This is the girl." The rest of the
		cast can stay- that is up to you, but
		that lead girl is not up to you. Now,
		you will see me one more time if you do
		good. You will see me two more times if
		you do bad. Good night.
    
The Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness.
Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing, then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the
Cowboy.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		You thinkin' this'll work out, cause I
		was thinkin' it just might.
    
				ADAM
		It will work out.
    
				COWBOY
		Good then, but, just in case, that bank's
		gonna stay closed a bit longer. You
		understand that?
    
				ADAM
		I understand.
    
				COWBOY
		You're an understandin' fella.
    
				ADAM
		So, this is the last time I see you then
		unless I do bad?
    
				COWBOY
		No, this one doesn't count. It's part of
		the original one. So then ... until we meet
		again.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
Adam gets in his car and drives off leaving the Cowboy
smiling behind him.

		"Before what?"
    
Betty pulls a table knife out from behind her back.
    
				BETTY
		"Before I kill you."

				RITA
		"Then they'd put you in jail."
    
Betty mimes with moving fingers tears flowing from her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big

Betty drops the kitchen knife and both girls start laughing.

		She wants to know who's staying in her

				BETTY
			(slowly, deliberately)
		It's just for a night or two, until she

Betty lifts her eyes to Coco's. Direct, clear.

		May I help you?

    
				BETTY
		My name is Betty Elms. I'm here to

		Good. Perfect timing. Have a seat and

The receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then
enters.
    
She closes the door behind her and Betty is alone in the
sitting room. She sits on a couch and looks at the old
movie posters covering all four walls.
    
In a moment the same door opens again and an elderly,
distinguished looking gentleman WALLY BROWN comes out
smiling. Betty stands up immediately.

		I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear

		Very pleased to meet you.

				WALLY
		Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
    
As they walk into Wally's office...
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		I took the liberty of inviting an extra
		person to see your audition. She saw
		your resume picture and was very
		interested in meeting you.
    
Inside Wally's office several people rise out of chairs when
Wally enters with Betty.
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		Betty Elms this is Jack Taft, my
		assistant, Jimmy Katz who we've already
		cast for the part of "Chuck". He'll be
		doing the scene with you.
		This is Julie Chadwick and Bob Brooker,
		the director, and our surprise guest is
		Sarah James. We couldn't afford her to
		cast our picture, but as casting agents
		go she's the best.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.
    
She and Betty shake hands.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		This is Nicki, my assistant.
    
Nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to Betty.
    
				WALLY
		And this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who
		you met out front.
    
Betty nervously smiles to the room.
    
				BETTY
		Hi.
    
				WALLY
		Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like
		a water or a coffee before we begin?
    
Betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I'm fine.
    
				WALLY
		Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty
		why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play
		the scene. Is there anything you'd like
		to say Bob... something to Betty before
		they begin?
    
Betty stops on her way across to Jimmy and looks to Bob the
director.
    
				BOB
		No ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
		them with themselves, so don't play it
		for real until it gets real.

    
Betty doesn't know what to say. She catches Sarah's
assistant, Nicki, rolling her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Okay.
    
Betty continues walking toward Jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. He's old enough to be her father.
    
				JIMMY
		Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
    
				BETTY
		What?
    
				JIMMY
		I want to play this one close, Bob. Like
		it was with that girl, what's her name,
		with the black hair. That felt good.
		Whaddya think?
    
Betty looks from Jimmy to Bob.
    
				BOB
		That'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush
		that line again. I told you... the line
		where you say, "Before what?"
    
				JIMMY
		I was playin' off 'em. They say,
		"They'll arrest you"... and stuff like
		that.. "put you in jail"... they say it
		like that. They all say it the same way,
		so I react like that.
    
Jimmy turns to Betty.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Look ... what's your name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I
		don't rush it. We play it close, just
		like in the movies.
    
Jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around Betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Dad's best friend goes to work.

    
Jimmy smiles as he brings Betty a little closer. She is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and Jimmy's
breath. There is a silence as Jimmy looks her in the eyes.
Everyone in the room is looking Betty in the eyes.
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		And ... ACTION!
    
Betty and Jimmy start the scene. It is very difficult for
Betty as Jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
    
				BETTY
		You're still here?
    
				JIMMY
		I came back. I thought that's what you
		wanted.
    
Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
    
				BETTY
		Nobody wants you here.
    
Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
    
				JIMMY
		Really?
    
Betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
    
				BETTY
		My parents are right upstairs! They
		think you've left.
    
Jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		So ... surprise!
    
Betty pushes him back.
    
				BETTY
		I can call them... I can call my dad.
    
				JIMMY
		But you won't.

    
He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
She's surprising herself.
    
				BETTY
			(almost a hot whisper)
		You're playing a dangerous game here. if
		you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
		going to work.
    
Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		You know what I want...it's not that
		difficult.
    
Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering desperately -
			slowly)
		Get out... Get out before I call my dad.
		He trusts you... you're his best friend.
			(her arms go around him)
		This will be the end of everything.
    
Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He
can only see Betty's eyes.
    
				JIMMY
		What about you? What will your dad think
		about you?
    
Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
    
				BETTY
		Stop... just stop! That's what you said
		from the beginning. If I tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put
		you in jail, so get out of here before...
    
				JIMMY
			(caught by her transfixing,
			sultry eyes, and almost
			breathless ... he finds himself
			taking an extra long pause)
		Before what?
    
As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
    
				BETTY
			(as she kisses him - whispers)
		Before I kill you.
    
Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
finally is able to say his line.
    
				JIMMY
		Then they'd put you in jail.
    
As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
cheeks. She backs away.
    
				BETTY
		I hate you... I hate us both!
    
She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
    
Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. Sarah turns to Nicki.
    
				SARAH JAMES

				NICKI
		Big time!
    
				WALLY
			(to everyone)
		Wow!
    
Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
    
				BETTY
		Well, there it was.

    
				JIMMY
		There it was it was! Baby, you got a
		way!
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		Very good. Really. I mean it was forced
		maybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very
		good, really.
    
				WALLY
		Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
		That was very impressive. You've done
		your Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her
		the first chance I get. We'll speak again
		soon I'm sure, and thank you so much for
		coming in.
    
				BETTY
		Well, thank you.
    
Betty doesn't quite know what to do. She moves to the center
of the room and just stands. Remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
    
Sarah stands and Nicki stands just after.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a
		lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
    
				WALLY
		Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah,
		and don't you be a stranger. We'd love to
		see you around here again real soon.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Well come along, Betty.
    
Sarah takes Betty's hand and they go to the door. Betty turns
back once more and smiles.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
		meeting all of you.
    
Everyone nods and waves and Betty is taken out by Sarah and
Nicki.

		Oh God, that was awful!
    
Betty's head spins to Sarah. A look of shock and let down on
her face.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		Oh, not you Betty. You were stellar and
		I mean that, but poor Wally. He'll never
		get that picture made. Wally's days were

			(sickening little laugh)
		How about that Jimmy Katz?
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Oh god! Jimmy Katz never had a day.
		Jimmy Katz never had a minute. Poor

Betty finds herself getting a little upset.
    
				BETTY
		They seem very nice to me, and
		Wally... Mr. Brown is a very close friend
		of my Aunt's, so. . .
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.
		I love Wally. I ought to. I was married

Betty does another shocked head turn.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		And I love actors, all actors, Jimmy Katz
		included. We just get a little catty
		sometimes. Now we want to take you across

At the word 'kill' Betty turns to her once again with a
questioning look.

INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
song continues to play over.

As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

				ADAM
			(calling out through an
			electronic megaphone)
		Cut it!
    
He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. He shakes her hand.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Thank you very much, Carol. It was really
		great of you to come in. I know how busy
		you are.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this
		script! Where do I sign?

    
				ADAM
		Look... I love you, but there's no way
		they're gonna let me cast this thing
		until I've seen everyone. I'll let you
		know as soon as I can.
    
				CAROL
		I know you will ... cause my manager's
		gonna bug you day and night ... me too.
    
				ADAM
		It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
		here.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
		me. I'm the girl that's going to play
		this part.
    
				ADAM
			(lightly pinching her cheek)
		See ya later.
    
Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to
some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant
Director and looks down at the man's notepad.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Who's next, Hank?
    
				HANK
		Camilla Rhodes.
    
Adam wonders - worries.
    
				ADAM
		Is she ready?
    
				HANK
		All ready.
    
				ADAM
		Bring her out.
    
Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
    
				HANK
			(through walkie-talkie)
		Camilla Rhodes next!

    
Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
singers step in behind her.
    
Adam nods to Hank.
    
				HANK (cont'd)
		Turn over!
    
The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
    
				ADAM
			(through megaphone)
		Playback!
    
Countdown before the music begins.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		ACTION!
    
The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
    
On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him.
    
				HANK
		Yeah?
    
Adam pauses.
    
				ADAM
		Get Jason over here.
    
Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
    
				HANK
		Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
    
Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
    
				JASON
		Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

    
				ADAM
		This is the girl!
    
At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
He smiles at Adam.
    
				RAY
		Excellent choice, Adam.
    
Adam is sick with himself.
    
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
    
				BETTY
		Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
		promised a friend.
    
She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm
sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella.
    
Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
    
Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over
Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty
disappear out the sound stage door.

Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
    
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
    
				BETTY
		C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
    
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Hey!

    
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd)
		Hey, how's Sol?
    
				BETTY
		Sol?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		No ... not you...
			(to Rita)
		I'm sorry... I forget your name.
    
				RITA
			(almost inaudible)
		Rita.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately.
		Tell him to come by the club.
    
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
    
				BETTY
		And what's your name?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
			(big smile)
		Cornell Dumont.
    
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering)
		Ask him who Sol is ...
    
Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe he could help...
    
Betty follows Rita through the gate to the waiting cab. They
get in and the cab pulls away.

INT. CAB - DAY
    
Betty reaches and gently grabs Rita's shoulder. She speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

    
				BETTY
		Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
    
				RITA
			(whispering back)
		But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of
		Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why
		we shouldn't go see about Diane
		Selwyn... it's better not to get in
		trouble.
    
				BETTY
		You're not going to get in trouble.
		You're going to find out who you are.
		Finding out who you are gets you out of
		trouble.
    
Rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again.

Betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand.
She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street.
    
				BETTY
		It should be around here...
    
Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(points)
		That's it ... 2590.
			(nudging Rita)
		Does it look familiar?
    
Rita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men
sitting in the front.
    
				RITA
		Don't stop!
    
				BETTY
		What is it? What do you see?!
    
				RITA
			(quietly - frantic)
		Those men in front, in the car.
    
				BETTY
		Do you know them?!

		No... but...

EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENT - BACK ALLEY - DAY
    
Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
    
				BETTY
		Selwyn ... number 12.
    
They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		It's this way.
    
They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
    
Both girls dive for the bushes.
    
The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(panting whisper)
		Now, you've got me scared.
    
Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
    

He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		See, I told you there was nothing to be
		afraid of!
    
They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
    
				RITA
		Oh no ... don't.
    
Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
    
				RITA (cont'd)
		No one's ...
    
Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Yes?
    
				BETTY
		Diane?
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Number 17.
    
				BETTY
		But it said #12.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		I switched apartments with her. She's in
		#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
		to the right.
    
The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		It's kind of hidden by the foliage.
    
Betty and Rita start to leave.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		She hasn't been around for a few days ...

    
				BETTY
		Well ... we'll leave her a note.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
			(starting toward them)
		I'll go with you. She's still got some of
		my stuff.
    
The phone rings from inside her bungalow.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
			(turning back)
		Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.
    
The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
    
				BETTY
		I guess you're not Diane.
    
Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
    
They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Still not home I guess.
    
The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.
    
				RITA
		I don't think...
    
				BETTY
			(looking around for anyone
			watching)
		C'mon help me in. I'll open the front
		door.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
    
				BETTY
		PUSH!!!

    
Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Meet you at the door.
    
Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I don't know if you want to come in here
		or not. There's some kind of horrible
		smell like... something...
    
Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.

Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows.
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. They move

Rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.

Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream
starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.
    
In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.

The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard

her bungalow.
    
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.

Sounds, music churning continues.
    
Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding
the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets
Betty hold her. Music changes ...
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I know what you're doing.
    
				RITA
			(through uncontrollable sobs)
		What ... I..HAVE... to do.
    
				BETTY
		I know what you have to do, but let me do
		it.
    
Rita turns and looks up at Betty, her eyes red with crying.
Betty pulls her up facing her. Rita lets Betty take the
scissors. They look into each other's eyes. Betty gently
strokes Rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror. She has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.
Betty's reflection comes in beside Rita's. They stare at the

out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.

Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox

money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.

		You've been so good to me ... now we know

close up against the door and stares out into the darkness.
She seems to be thinking about something. Suddenly she turns
and looks ahead. The car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		What are you doing? You don't stop
		here ...
    
The car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind
curve. Both men turn to the woman.
    
				DRIVER
		Get out of the car.

EXT.  FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
    
Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
    

    
The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive.

INT. EXT. - CADILLAC LIMOUSINE
    
The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets
up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below. She clumsily starts down toward it.
   
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
Franklin Avenue. A car races by and its headlights flare on
her face. Her expression shows fear and panic. She doesn't
know where she is or where to go. She runs frantically across
the street. She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard. Coming up Sunset in the
distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going.
She hurries into the darkness of another residential area. A
car turns onto the street and comes toward her. She
instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes.
  
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street. A drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her. She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building. The couple passes by without
noticing her. Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.
   
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE   - NIGHT
    
Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives,
HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40's to 50), stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They
do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a
long moment.
  
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		You feel it?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah.
    
They continue to stare.
    
 
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along
		the shoulder ... man up the road said he
		saw two cars drag racin'...then you got
		that blind corner.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		The boys found this on the floor in back
		of the Caddy.
    
Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Yeah, they showed me
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Could be unrelated.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Could be...any of those dead kids wearin'

				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		That's what I'm thinkin'.
    
Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
He looks out and wonders.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - EARLY DAWN
    
The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open. The cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate. The woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building. She sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage.

    
They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat. Their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door.

The woman comes into a living room where a single trunk
remains. She goes further into the apartment and crouches
down in a back corner of the kitchen. She listens as
footsteps come across the courtyard. She hears the red-headed
woman and the cab driver get the trunk. She hears them set it
down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-
headed woman walks right past her, grabs a set of keys off
the kitchen counter, then leaves the apartment. The woman can
hear the door being locked. She lets go, slides to the
kitchen floor, and passes out.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT , HOLLYWOOD - MORNING
    
Two well-dressed men HERB and DAN (mid 30's) are sitting at a
table drinking coffee. Herb has finished eating his
breakfast, but Dan hasn't touched his bacon and eggs - he
appears too nervous to eat. A blonde waitress with a
nameplate saying "DIANE" lays the check on their table
smiles, then walks off.
    
				HERB
		Why did you want to go to breakfast if
		you're not hungry?

				DAN
		I just wanted to come here.

				HERB
		To Denny's? I wasn't going to say
		anything, but why Denny's?
    
				DAN
		This Denny's.
    
				HERB
		Okay. Why this Denny's?
    
    
				DAN
		It's kind of embarrassing but,
    
				HERB
		Go ahead.
    
				DAN
		I had a dream about this place.
    
				HERB
		Oh boy.
    
				DAN
		You see what I mean...
    
				HERB
		Okay, so you had a dream about this
		place. Tell me.
    
				DAN
		Well ... it's the second one I've had, but
		they were both the same......they start
		out that I'm in here but it's not day or
		night. It's kinda half night, but it
		looks just like this except for the
		light, but I'm scared like I can't tell
		ya. Of all people you're standing right
		over there by that counter. You're in
		both dreams and you're scared. I get
		even more frightened when I see how
		afraid you are and then I realize what it
		is - there's a man...in back of this
		place. He's the one ... he's the one
		that's doing it. I can see him through
		the wall. I can see his face and I hope
		I never see that face ever outside a
		dream.
    
Herb stares at Dan to see if he will continue. Dan looks
around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.
    
				DAN (cont'd)
		That's it.
    
				HERB
		So, you came to see if he's out there?

				DAN
		To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
    
				HERB
		Right then.

    
Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to
pay. Dan just sits.
    
As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.
Herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with
the cashier. He motions for Dan to follow him. Dan rises
reluctantly and he and Herb make their way outside.

Now Herb waits for Dan to lead the way.
    
				DAN
		Around here.
    
Dan takes Herb across the front of Denny's to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back.
    
They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone. Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.
    
CLOSER ON DAN
    
Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
    
The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
    
Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
    
Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
    
Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.
    
				HERB
		Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!
    
He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse
in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.

A blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us. As the

		It's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's

		Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and

		The best of luck to you, Betty. Take

		Okay I will. Thanks again.
    
Betty and Irene give each other a hug. The old gentleman nods
to Betty and takes Irene off. Betty smiles after them.
Suddenly someone is grabbing her bags. She turns abruptly to
find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. She turns
once more and waves at Irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.

Betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. Each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega,
Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire
Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn
right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst
and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.

The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell.

    
An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
    
				MANAGER
		Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.

				BETTY
		I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois

		Pleased to meet you.
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		You can call me Coco ... everybody does.
		Stay there, I'll get the key.
    
				BETTY
		Okay, Coco.
    
Coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. She starts off into the
courtyard and Betty picks up her bags and follows. As Coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
    
				COCO
		I guess it was your grandfather, was

		Yes, he is. He raises corn.
    
				COCO
		Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood

				BETTY
		Well, I ...
    
				COCO
		You don't have to tell me. It's written

		You probably don't remember her, but
		Louise Bonner lives right over there in

		Have many famous actors and actresses
		lived here? I was meaning to ask you
		that.
    
				COCO
		Honey, all the great ones came through

A haunting music begins to swell.

		People say in the springtime when the

				BETTY
		I guess I've come to quite a place.
    
				COCO
		Sweetheart, you don't know the half of
		it.
    
The music fades.
    
Coco looks down suddenly. On the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.

Coco leaves and closes the door behind her. Betty begins to
explore the apartment.- After walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. She moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. She goes into the
bedroom. She smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. She notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. She
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling

the mirror above it. Suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. There before her is the naked,

motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
    
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.

holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
scream.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh...man!
    
With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		Hey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
		and use the phone. Help me out. You
		gotta call the hospital.
    
The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
seeing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		I mean it! Get down here quick! She's
		hurt and I can't do everything myself,
		man.

    
Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		No, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
    
He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh ... man!
    
Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.
    
				VOICES
		What the hell .... what happened? What's
		this cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
		It's the vacuum what did it.
    
Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTURY CITY BUILDING - DAY
    
We see three men sitting at a conference table RAYMOND(RAY)
HOTT -president of production, wearing a crisp blue
suit,VINCENT DARBY -senior vice-president, wearing a crisp
green suit and ROBERT SMITH -talent manager, wearing a crisp
brown suit. Ray and Mr. Darby sit at the head of the table
and Robert Smith sits along the side. A younger man -ADAM
KESHER enters and sits down, with an arrogant nonchalance,
next to Robert Smith. Adam is dressed in a frumpy old
fashioned plaid shirt, worn jacket, dark blue cotton slacks,
and a pair of old brown wing tips. As he sits he is holding
and twirling a vintage "7-iron" golf club.
    
				ADAM
		So what's the problem?
    
				RAY
		There is no problem.
    
				ADAM
		So why did you idiots bring me
		here? ... I'm in the middle of making a
		picture.
    
Silence for a moment. A man enters through a rear door and
whispers something to Mr. Darby and shows him something on a
piece of paper. Mr. Darby studies the piece of paper.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(to man who entered)
		What was it last time?
    
The man who entered points to something on the paper.
    
				MR. DARBY (cont'd)
		Okay, let's try the next one.
    
The man nods and leaves.
    
				RAY
		He isn't gonna like it.
    
				MR. DARBY
		We'll see.
    
				ADAM
		Hello ... who're we talkin' about here?
    
Robert Smith shuffles nervously in his chair next to Adam.

    
				ROBERT SMITH
		You see Adam... there are some suggestions
		which are to be brought forward ... and I
		know you said you would entertain
		suggestions and that's all anybody here
		is asking you to do.
    
				ADAM
		What're you talking about?
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		An open mind ... You're in the process of

EXT. CENTURY CITY - DAY
    
Before us is a huge modern office building of glass and
steel. Two men in dark suits have exited a large limousine
and are walking up into the building. We drift up the facade,
higher and higher moving in toward the top of the building.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
The men exit an elevator and move through a lobby where a
plaque beneath an enormous bronze sculpture reads "Ryan
Entertainment". Gliding we travel behind the two men down a
wide, carpeted hallway with blonde wood and glass on each
side. They enter through two large blonde wooden doors to the
conference room.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
    
The men in dark suits go in as if they owned the place. Ray,
Mr. Darby and Robert Smith stand immediately. Adam remains
seated. Mr. Darby is the only one near enough to attempt a
hand shake, but when he offers his hand it is not taken. The
men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and
without acknowledging anyone. One of the men in a dark suit
opens a briefcase. Ray has been trying to make
introductions.
    
				RAY
		Ah... the Castigliane brothers. Let me
		introduce you around ... please ... sit down.
		(after they've already seated
		themselves) ... this is Mr. Darby whom you
		know and this is the director Adam
		Kesher and his manager Robert Smith
    
The Castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this,
however, during the introductions the one with the briefcase
removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of Ray.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Ah... she's very pretty.
    
We see the photo of the girl - of a nice looking blonde -
someone we've never seen before. Adam looks like he doesn't
know what's going on and he's getting upset about not
knowing. His manager, Robert Smith, is beginning to see the
makings of a confrontation - he's starting to panic.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(referring to Castigliane
			brothers)
		May I offer you gentlemen anything?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Espresso.

				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Nothing. 
    
				ADAM
		Uh  what's the photo for?
    
				MR. DARBY
			(picking up phone and speaking)
		One espresso ... no, that's it.
			(sets phone down - addresses
			Castigliane brothers)
		I think you're going to enjoy your
		espresso this time... I've been doing
		quite a bit of research knowing how hard
		you are to please... this one comes highly
		recommended.
    
				ADAM
		What's the photo for?
    
				RAY
			(to Adam)
		A recommendation... a recommendation to
		you Adam.
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Not a recommendation.
    
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		What girl? For what? What is this Ray?
    
Ray, still standing with a forced smile, turns to the
Castigliane brothers.
    
				RAY
		We'd be happy to put her in the pile for
		considerations ... you'd be pleased to know
		there's quite a lot of interest in this
		role.
    
				ADAM
		Interest?! There's six of the top
		actresses that want this thing.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		Ray...you better take care of this.
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		Hold on ... hold on, Adam.
    
				ADAM
		Hold on!!!!!!!! There's no way, there's
		no way!!!
    
Luigi Castigliane's espresso is brought in by the man who had
been in earlier. The man sets the espresso down in front of
Luigi and takes a step back. The room becomes silent -
watching the Espresso Man and Luigi. Without looking up Luigi
speaks softly.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
			(leading forward to hear)
		Pardon?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
		Of course. Excuse me.
    
The Espresso Man leaves the room. Luigi looks at the
espresso. Vincenzo stares at Adam.
    
Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo. The Espresso
man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the
espresso.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN (cont'd)
		Will that be all, Sir?
    
Luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very
still waiting, the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room.
    
Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the
espresso cup. He looks around at Ray and Mr. Darby - seeing
them stare at the espresso cup.
    
Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam.
    
Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand.
With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it
above the napkin. He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth.
He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso
to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in
that position for a moment.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Is shit!
    
Luigi Castigliane stands up.
    
				RAY
		I'm sorry. That was a highly
		recommended...
    
				MR. DARBY
		That's considered one of the finest
		espressos in the world , Sir.
    
Luigi just stands there. A small thread on his left suit
jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back
into the fabric. Vincenzo closes his briefcase, takes out a
hankerchief and cleans his nose - then stands, placing the
handkerchief back in his pocket.
    
				ADAM
		Wait a minute!! What's going on here?
    
Vincenzo just stares toward Adam as if he's not even there.
    
				ADAM
		There's no way that girl is in my movie!
    
Silence.

    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		That is the girl.
    
The Castigliane brothers begin to leave. Adam stands up
trembling with anger.
    
				ADAM
		Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		It is no longer your film.
    
Adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in. The
Castigliane brothers leave. As the big blonde wood doors
close behind them Adam starts to boil.
    
				ADAM
			(screaming)
		You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
    
				RAY
		I'll speak to someone.
    
				ADAM
			(turning to his manager)
		And you'd better speak to someone
		too ... or find yourself another client!!
		This smells like a set-up to me!
			(back to Ray)
		And by the way, Ray, I don't know who
		these guys are kidding, but every foot of
		film I've shot is in a vault at the lab
		that only I can access. No one's getting
		that film!!
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		This is a catastrophe...
			(turning toward Ray)
		you told me they might insist on a girl,
		that's all.
    
				ADAM
		Why didn't you tell me, Robert? That's
		what I mean ... you set me up! I woulda
		never come here.
			(standing)
		I'm leaving. I'm a director you don't
		want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!
    
Adam storms out of the room.

		Well...I didn't know that was going to

EXTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - CENTURY CITY - DAY
    
Adam exits the building carrying his 7-iron. An attendant
takes his valet parking ticket. While Adam, still fuming,
waits for his car he notices the big limo standing off to one
side. He stares at the car and the huge limo driver leaning
up against the front driver's side door.
    
Adam's car arrives - a late model Porsche. Before Adam gets
into his car he addresses the attendant.
    
				ADAM
		Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
		that limo?
    
				ATTENDANT
		They two guys in dark suits?
    
Adam nods and walks over to the limo. The limo driver eyes
him and his 7-iron suspiciously.
    
				ADAM
		Castigliane brothers?
    
				LIMO DRIVER
		Beat it!
    
				ADAM
		O.K.
    
Adam raises his 7-iron and smashes out the limo's windshield.
He whacks two big dents in the hood, then smashes out a
headlight. The limo driver starts towards him. Adam laughs,
runs to his car and takes off.

INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - LATER DAY
    
Betty is stretched out on the big leather couch in the living
room. A half eaten sandwich and chips are on a plate on the
coffee table next to her. She is talking on the phone.

    
				BETTY
		No Grandpa, you wouldn't believe it.
		It's more beautiful than I ever
		dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food.
		The refrigerator's full ... Aunt Ruthie
		said she'd call me when she got
		settled... it was real smooth. I sat next
		to a lady who gave up her first class
		seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was
		so nice to me. She invited me to her
		house sometime. It's in Bel Air which is
		a place where people have a lot of
		money... I will. Everybody's telling me
		to be careful, but I sure love it here
		Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get
		here ... yeah, it's long distance. I love
		you. Say hello to Grams. Give her a big
		kiss for me. Okay, I love you
		Grandpa ... bye.
    
Betty hangs up the phone, takes a big bite of her sandwich
and lays flat out on the couch, chewing and smiling up at the
ceiling. She suddenly remembers Rita and her promise to look
in on her. She gets off the couch and goes into the bedroom.

INT. - EXT. APARTMENT - DAY
    
Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
    
Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee.
The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. The phone inside rings. Betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. She crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.
    
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Hello ... Aunt Ruth!! I can't tell you how
		happy I am. Your place is so fantastic!
		Yes ... Coco...what a character. I really
		like her... that's too bad...waiting in an
		airport must not be too fun. What's a
		mosquito plane? ... Oh I get it. How long
		does that take from Montreal? ... Well,
		you'll sleep good tonight ... Hudson Bay
		sounds beautiful ...oh well, I hope you
		packed your coat. (laughs). You mean
		the audition...Wally Brown... she didn't
		mention it but he'll fax the dialogue to
		Coco? Suddenly I'm so nervous ... okay
		Aunt Ruth... I'll try. I'll study those
		lines until I know them inside out.
		Yes, either right here on this fabulous
		leather couch or I'll take them with a
		coffee in the courtyard like a regular
		movie star. (laughs). Oh! I got a real
		shock to find your friend Rita here. She
		was in the shower and I opened the
		door ... Rita ... what do you mean? She was
		in an accident ... your friend Rita. No,
		Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't
		see her. She's sleeping. No... she's
		very nice. I'm sure there's some
		explanation, Aunt Ruth... I don't think we
		have to do that. Please don't worry.
		I'll take care of it. No, I'll let you
		know. Where can I ... okay I'll get it
		from Coco.
		No, please don't worry... thank you so
		much for letting me stay here. You've
		made me so happy... thank you, thank you.
		Please don't worry... Aunt Ruth we don't
		need the police. I'll call you when you
		get to Hudson Bay. Please...
		please ... Goodbye Aunt Ruth.
    
Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. She sits for a
moment listening. Silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. As she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. Rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. Betty goes into the bedroom. Rita looks up
at her with desperation.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You're awake... I think I misunderstood
		you. I thought you knew my Aunt and
		that's why you were here. I just talked
		to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me

Rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with
her hands.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Rita?
    
				RITA

		I'm... sorry. I ...

Betty's heart softens.

		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA

		I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke
		up... I thought sleep would do it ...
    
Betty kneels down in front of her.
    
				BETTY
		What's wrong?
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I don't know who I am.
    
				BETTY
		What do you mean? You're Rita.
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I'm not. I don't know what my name is.
		I don't know who I am!!
    
Betty looks down at the purse next to Rita's dress. She picks
it up and hands it to Rita.
    
				BETTY
		This is your purse. Your name must be in
		your purse.
    
Rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. She hesitates.
Something is worrying her. She looks at Betty for help.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You want to know don't you?
    
				RITA
		I ... yes, but ... I ...

    
				BETTY
		Open it!
    
Rita slowly unzips the purse. The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
    
Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.
    
Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of horror.
(note: This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)

Ray crosses a carpeted closed area. He mounts a flight of
stairs. At the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. Ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. At the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. Again Ray punches in a code. The elevator opens and
Ray goes in. The elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. Ray waits. Finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
		Who is it please?

The elevator begins to move up. When it stops, the door opens

beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
			(very quietly)
		You may go right in, Ray.
    
Ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. The
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. Heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
    
    
Ray enters and the doors close behind him. Ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
    
				RAY
		Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced
		Rowk).
    
Mr. Roque stares at Ray silently.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Do you want him replaced?
    
Mr. Roque continues to stare.
    
				RAY
		I know they said...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Then?
    
				RAY
		Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but
		that means we should ...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
				RAY
		Shut everything down ... Is that something
		that...do you want us to shut everything

Silence. Ray doesn't know what to do. He struggles to
interpret Mr. Roque's silence. He waits. Mr. Roque does
nothing but stare.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Then we'll shut everything down.
    
Silence.
    
Ray turns. The doors open as he approaches them and he

Two guys, JOE ( the guy who killed Ed in the sixth floor
office) and BILLY another unkept, rocker type delivery man
are standing waiting for their chili dogs with a girl, LANEY,
who could be very good looking but she seems to be in poor
health. Her hair is long and stringy. She's wearing a
tight, short sleeve blue sweater, black jeans and boots.
    
				BILLY
		Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

				JOE
		No, no, no, I told you. They're fine.
		They're all real happy.

				BILLY
		My next delivery is up that way, so I'll

				JOE
		You're so easy.
    
				BILLY
		Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
    
				JOE
		Yeah, what for?
    
				BILLY
		Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's

Mr. Roque, in his wheelchair is still in the center of the
huge softly lit, windowless office. His manservant standing
silently behind him. The small built-in wheelchair phone
rings. Mr. Roque pushes a button on a small intricate remote
device he holds in his right hand. A slender streamlined
microphone rises from the arm of the chair.
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
He listens through a high-tech earplant which we now see.
    
				MR. ROQUE (cont'd)
		Thank you.

skin is pale white, almost translucent. The fingers are long
and seem slightly too large. At the ends of the fingers and
thumb are stretched tapered high gloss red fingernails which
slightly curve downward. The forefinger of the hand presses
a button on the phone. A small tone sounds - followed by a
very modern sounding coded signal.

A car - a late model generic sedan is moving toward us. Two
men dressed in suits and wearing dark glasses are driving
slowly. As they go each man is scanning sidewalks,
buildings, passing cars as if hunting for someone. They pass
by us and as we turn we leave them and pick-up Adam driving
in the opposite direction in the other lane. We stay with
Adam.
    
Adam drives his Porsche up a palm lined street.

Adam pulls into his driveway, but is blocked from entering
the garage by a poolman's truck. He gets out of the car and
looks at the truck - sees the insignia on the door which is a
blue square with the word "Gene" above and the word "Clean"
below. Adam hears steps behind him and turns. A JAPANESE
GARDENER is coming toward him smiling and bowing.
    
				JAPANESE GARDENER
		Ah, Mister ... you remember me. I am Taka.

He hears a noise, something falling. He walks in the

hears voices as he throws the door open.
    
LORRAINE and the poolman GENE are in bed.

Adam leaves the kitchen and goes out into the garage. He
turns on the light and looks around. He spots some paint
cans on a shelf and grabs one and goes back into the kitchen.
He can hear Lorraine calling his name. She seems to be
coming closer. He sets the jewelry case and the paint can on
the floor, kneels down and opens the paint can with his car
key. Just as Lorraine enters the kitchen, he opens the
jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of Hot Pink
paint into her jewelry case.
    
				LORRAINE
		WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???
    
He puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them
about. Lorraine rushes toward him.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		STOP IT!!!
    
Lorraine grabs hold of him. Starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. She tears his jacket. Adam stands all at
once and with his wet Hot Pink hands he pushes Lorraine and
slams her into the kitchen counter just as Gene the poolman
enters. Gene grabs ahold of Adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into Adam's face.
    
				GENE
		That's not a way to treat your wife,
		buddy. I don't care what she's done.
    
Adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries
to hit Gene. Gene blocks his punch and slams Adam again,
knocking him down to the kitchen floor where he lands and
spills the jewelry case. Adam, now covered with paint, is
picked up by Gene and thrown out toward the front door.
    
				LORRAINE
		Throw him out!
    
Lorraine opens the front door while Gene picks Adam up, moves
him across the carpet and heaves him out onto the front lawn.
Lorraine slams the door behind him.
    
Adam picks himself up, severely dazed and bleeding pretty
badly, he heads for his car.

They look around the room... There's a hatbox in the closet

Coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. The boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. As the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk Betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.

		We'll take our check.
    
Diane searches through her many checks to find Betty and
Rita's.
    
The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue
dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the
manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her
eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes
out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's
check as she places it on their table. She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty
noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the
woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then
leaving.

    
The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her
pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the
manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she
goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense
and lost in a thought.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(without moving a muscle)
		Shhhh.
    
At that moment Diane the waitress reappears at their table.
Diane looks Betty in the eye and while looking at Betty her
left hand slides the Mont Blanc out from under the check and
back into her pocket.
    
				DIANE
		Thank you. Come in again.
    
Betty holds her gaze.
    
				BETTY
		You're welcome. We will.

TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking
down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front
door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back.
    
Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers.
Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is
on her face and clothes.
    
				KENNY
		Adam Kesher...he...
    
				LORRAINE
		Yeah, right ... get lost!
    
She slams the door, but Kenny's foot stops it and pushes it
back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open
once again. Kenny enters the house.

		This is Adam Kesher's house. Where...

		Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!!
    
Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with
pink paint.
    
				GENE
		I guess you don't understand English.
		She asked to leave. Here's the door.
    
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door.
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.

    
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -
spilling out onto the kitchen floor. Finishing his work with
the vintage golf clubs - Kenny leaves.

Betty opens the door. Betty finds the face of the actress,

				BETTY
		Ruth's gone on a film. I'm her niece

				LOUISE
		Someone is in trouble. Who are you? Why

				BETTY
		I'm her niece. She's letting me stay

				LOUISE
		No it isn't. That's not it. That's not

		Where's Ruth?

		I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are

Louise turns and sees Coco approaching across the courtyard.

Coco comes up and grabs hold of Louise. She turns over to
Betty.

		This is Betty, Ruth's niece. In fact and

		Yes...what is it?

		I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to

		The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative

		How...  how'd they know I was here?

		Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're

		Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea

		Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the

		You gotta be kidding?

		Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day.

		I'll call him, then call you back...If

		Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.

		I'm just offering a place to stay.

		I understand, Cynthia and thank you for

Adam, in his Porsche, makes his way up the canyon.
    
INT. PORSCHE
    
Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon
road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area
gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a
dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in
a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No
one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling
stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from
the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the
brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light
is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled
unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red
embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string
tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The
Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front
of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.
    
				COWBOY
		Howdy!
    
				ADAM
		Howdy to you.

    
				COWBOY
		Beautiful night.
    
				ADAM
		Yeah.
    
				COWBOY
		Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the
		way up to see me from that Beverly Hills
		Hotel.

				ADAM
		No problem. What's on your mind?
    
				COWBOY
		Well now, here's a man who wants to get
		right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it
		are ya?
    
				ADAM
		Whatever.
    
				COWBOY
		A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes
		some ways toward how a man's life will
		be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
    
				ADAM
		Sure.
    
				COWBOY
		Now... did you answer cause you thought
		that's what I wanted to hear or did you
		think about what I said and answer cause
		you truly believe that to be right?
    
				ADAM
		I agree with what you said...truly.
    
				COWBOY
		What did I say?
    
				ADAM
		That a man's attitude determines to a
		large extent how his life will be.
    
				COWBOY
		So since you agree I guess you could be a
		person who does not care about the good
		life.
    
				ADAM
		How's that?

    
				COWBOY
		Well, just stop for a little second and
		think about it. Will ya do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Okay, I'm thinking.
    
				COWBOY
		No. You're too busy being a smart aleck
		to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think
		and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya
		do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Look ... where's this going? What do you
		want me to do?
    
				COWBOY
		There's sometimes a buggy. How many
		drivers does a buggy have?
    
				ADAM
		One.
    
				COWBOY
		So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy
		and you fix your attitude and you can
		ride along with me.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
				COWBOY
		Now I know a few things. I know you have
		had a rough day. You're probably thinkin'
		I don't know the half of it, but in
		actual fact I know every part of it. The
		business of gittin' thrown off your
		movie, the heartache of seeing your wife
		with another man... losin' access to that
		precious film vault...
    
Adam suddenly looks stunned, unsure.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		... realizin' you don't have hardly a
		nickel to your name and then add on to
		that the sickenin' feeling some men are
		gonna catch you and hurt you bad for
		bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like
		that. They are rough, but what will
		tomorrow bring? Will it be better than
		today? The same ... or worse?
		A lot of that is up to us individually.
		Up to us and our attitude. When the
		Castigliane brothers said "This is no
		longer your film," they meant it, but
		they didn't mean you were not going to
		direct it. I want you to go back to work
		tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
		actress anyway ... audition many girls for
		the part. When you see the girl that was
		shown to you earlier today, you will say
		" This is the girl." The rest of the
		cast can stay- that is up to you, but
		that lead girl is not up to you. Now,
		you will see me one more time if you do
		good. You will see me two more times if
		you do bad. Good night.
    
The Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness.
Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing, then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the
Cowboy.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		You thinkin' this'll work out, cause I
		was thinkin' it just might.
    
				ADAM
		It will work out.
    
				COWBOY
		Good then, but, just in case, that bank's
		gonna stay closed a bit longer. You
		understand that?
    
				ADAM
		I understand.
    
				COWBOY
		You're an understandin' fella.
    
				ADAM
		So, this is the last time I see you then
		unless I do bad?
    
				COWBOY
		No, this one doesn't count. It's part of
		the original one. So then ... until we meet
		again.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
Adam gets in his car and drives off leaving the Cowboy
smiling behind him.

		go in and turn right at the first street.
		Then we want to walk three blocks down
		past Stage 17 to the white Executive
		Building. Once we're on the second floor
		the receptionist will take us from there.
		Now do we have name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty Elms.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		Let's see if we have a pass for Betty
		Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good

				BETTY
		Thank you... thank you very much.

INT.   EXECUTIVE BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
    
Betty finishes climbing some stairs and crosses to the
receptionist. She hands over her pass. The receptionist
looks at it, hands it back to Betty and points down the hall
to her left.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Number 43, on the left.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you.
    
Betty walks down the long corridor past several offices. The
door to office 43 is open when she arrives and she enters a
large sitting room with a receptionist at a desk off to one
side.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		May I help you?

    
				BETTY
		My name is Betty Elms. I'm here to
		audition for... Mr. Brown
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Good. Perfect timing. Have a seat and
		I'll get Mr. Brown.
    
The receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then
enters.
    
She closes the door behind her and Betty is alone in the
sitting room. She sits on a couch and looks at the old
movie posters covering all four walls.
    
In a moment the same door opens again and an elderly,
distinguished looking gentleman WALLY BROWN comes out
smiling. Betty stands up immediately.
    
				WALLY
		Betty Elms?
    
				BETTY
		Yes.
    
				WALLY
		I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear
		friend of mine so it's particularly nice
		to meet you.
    
				BETTY
		Very pleased to meet you.

				WALLY
		Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
    
As they walk into Wally's office...
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		I took the liberty of inviting an extra
		person to see your audition. She saw
		your resume picture and was very
		interested in meeting you.
    
Inside Wally's office several people rise out of chairs when
Wally enters with Betty.
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		Betty Elms this is Jack Taft, my
		assistant, Jimmy Katz who we've already
		cast for the part of "Chuck". He'll be
		doing the scene with you.
		This is Julie Chadwick and Bob Brooker,
		the director, and our surprise guest is
		Sarah James. We couldn't afford her to
		cast our picture, but as casting agents
		go she's the best.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.
    
She and Betty shake hands.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		This is Nicki, my assistant.
    
Nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to Betty.
    
				WALLY
		And this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who
		you met out front.
    
Betty nervously smiles to the room.
    
				BETTY
		Hi.
    
				WALLY
		Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like
		a water or a coffee before we begin?
    
Betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I'm fine.
    
				WALLY
		Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty
		why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play
		the scene. Is there anything you'd like
		to say Bob... something to Betty before
		they begin?
    
Betty stops on her way across to Jimmy and looks to Bob the
director.
    
				BOB
		No ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
		them with themselves, so don't play it
		for real until it gets real.

    
Betty doesn't know what to say. She catches Sarah's
assistant, Nicki, rolling her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Okay.
    
Betty continues walking toward Jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. He's old enough to be her father.
    
				JIMMY
		Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
    
				BETTY
		What?
    
				JIMMY
		I want to play this one close, Bob. Like
		it was with that girl, what's her name,
		with the black hair. That felt good.
		Whaddya think?
    
Betty looks from Jimmy to Bob.
    
				BOB
		That'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush
		that line again. I told you... the line
		where you say, "Before what?"
    
				JIMMY
		I was playin' off 'em. They say,
		"They'll arrest you"... and stuff like
		that.. "put you in jail"... they say it
		like that. They all say it the same way,
		so I react like that.
    
Jimmy turns to Betty.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Look ... what's your name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I
		don't rush it. We play it close, just
		like in the movies.
    
Jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around Betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Dad's best friend goes to work.

    
Jimmy smiles as he brings Betty a little closer. She is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and Jimmy's
breath. There is a silence as Jimmy looks her in the eyes.
Everyone in the room is looking Betty in the eyes.
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		And ... ACTION!
    
Betty and Jimmy start the scene. It is very difficult for
Betty as Jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
    
				BETTY
		You're still here?
    
				JIMMY
		I came back. I thought that's what you
		wanted.
    
Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
    
				BETTY
		Nobody wants you here.
    
Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
    
				JIMMY
		Really?
    
Betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
    
				BETTY
		My parents are right upstairs! They
		think you've left.
    
Jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		So ... surprise!
    
Betty pushes him back.
    
				BETTY
		I can call them... I can call my dad.
    
				JIMMY
		But you won't.

    
He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
She's surprising herself.
    
				BETTY
			(almost a hot whisper)
		You're playing a dangerous game here. if
		you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
		going to work.
    
Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		You know what I want...it's not that
		difficult.
    
Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering desperately -
			slowly)
		Get out... Get out before I call my dad.
		He trusts you... you're his best friend.
			(her arms go around him)
		This will be the end of everything.
    
Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He
can only see Betty's eyes.
    
				JIMMY
		What about you? What will your dad think
		about you?
    
Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
    
				BETTY
		Stop... just stop! That's what you said
		from the beginning. If I tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put
		you in jail, so get out of here before...
    
				JIMMY
			(caught by her transfixing,
			sultry eyes, and almost
			breathless ... he finds himself
			taking an extra long pause)
		Before what?
    
As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
    
				BETTY
			(as she kisses him - whispers)
		Before I kill you.
    
Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
finally is able to say his line.
    
				JIMMY
		Then they'd put you in jail.
    
As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
cheeks. She backs away.
    
				BETTY
		I hate you... I hate us both!
    
She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
    
Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. Sarah turns to Nicki.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		I'm going to take her over there.
    
				NICKI
		Big time!
    
				WALLY
			(to everyone)
		Wow!
    
Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
    
				BETTY
		Well, there it was.

    
				JIMMY
		There it was it was! Baby, you got a
		way!
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		Very good. Really. I mean it was forced
		maybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very
		good, really.
    
				WALLY
		Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
		That was very impressive. You've done
		your Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her
		the first chance I get. We'll speak again
		soon I'm sure, and thank you so much for
		coming in.
    
				BETTY
		Well, thank you.
    
Betty doesn't quite know what to do. She moves to the center
of the room and just stands. Remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
    
Sarah stands and Nicki stands just after.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a
		lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
    
				WALLY
		Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah,
		and don't you be a stranger. We'd love to
		see you around here again real soon.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Well come along, Betty.
    
Sarah takes Betty's hand and they go to the door. Betty turns
back once more and smiles.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
		meeting all of you.
    
Everyone nods and waves and Betty is taken out by Sarah and
Nicki.

INT.- CORRIDOR EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
    
The three of them walk down the corridor.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Oh God, that was awful!
    
Betty's head spins to Sarah. A look of shock and let down on
her face.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		Oh, not you Betty. You were stellar and
		I mean that, but poor Wally. He'll never
		get that picture made. Wally's days were
		up twenty -years ago.
    
				NICKI
			(sickening little laugh)
		How about that Jimmy Katz?
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Oh god! Jimmy Katz never had a day.
		Jimmy Katz never had a minute. Poor
		Wally.
    
Betty finds herself getting a little upset.
    
				BETTY
		They seem very nice to me, and
		Wally... Mr. Brown is a very close friend
		of my Aunt's, so. . .
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.
		I love Wally. I ought to. I was married
		to him for ten years.
    
Betty does another shocked head turn.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		And I love actors, all actors, Jimmy Katz
		included. We just get a little catty
		sometimes. Now we want to take you across
		the way and introduce you to a director
		who's a head above the rest. He's got a
		project that you would kill!
    
At the word 'kill' Betty turns to her once again with a
questioning look.

    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		... Knock it right out of the park.

INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
song continues to play over.

As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

				ADAM
			(calling out through an
			electronic megaphone)
		Cut it!
    
He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. He shakes her hand.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Thank you very much, Carol. It was really
		great of you to come in. I know how busy
		you are.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this
		script! Where do I sign?

    
				ADAM
		Look... I love you, but there's no way
		they're gonna let me cast this thing
		until I've seen everyone. I'll let you
		know as soon as I can.
    
				CAROL
		I know you will ... cause my manager's
		gonna bug you day and night ... me too.
    
				ADAM
		It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
		here.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
		me. I'm the girl that's going to play
		this part.
    
				ADAM
			(lightly pinching her cheek)
		See ya later.
    
Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to
some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant
Director and looks down at the man's notepad.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Who's next, Hank?
    
				HANK
		Camilla Rhodes.
    
Adam wonders - worries.
    
				ADAM
		Is she ready?
    
				HANK
		All ready.
    
				ADAM
		Bring her out.
    
Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
    
				HANK
			(through walkie-talkie)
		Camilla Rhodes next!

    
Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
singers step in behind her.
    
Adam nods to Hank.
    
				HANK (cont'd)
		Turn over!
    
The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
    
				ADAM
			(through megaphone)
		Playback!
    
Countdown before the music begins.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		ACTION!
    
The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
    
On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him.
    
				HANK
		Yeah?
    
Adam pauses.
    
				ADAM
		Get Jason over here.
    
Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
    
				HANK
		Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
    
Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
    
				JASON
		Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

    
				ADAM
		This is the girl!
    
At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
He smiles at Adam.
    
				RAY
		Excellent choice, Adam.
    
Adam is sick with himself.
    
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
    
				BETTY
		Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
		promised a friend.
    
She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm
sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella.
    
Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
    
Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over
Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty
disappear out the sound stage door.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT.  1612 HAVENHURST - STREET - DAY
    
Chris Isaak song "Except The New Girl" continues.
    
An idling cab sits waiting with back door open.
    
							CUT TO:
    
COURTYARD - 1612 HAVENHURST DAY
    
Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
    
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
    
				BETTY
		C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
    
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Hey!

    
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd)
		Hey, how's Sol?
    
				BETTY
		Sol?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		No ... not you...
			(to Rita)
		I'm sorry... I forget your name.
    
				RITA
			(almost inaudible)
		Rita.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately.
		Tell him to come by the club.
    
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
    
				BETTY
		And what's your name?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
			(big smile)
		Cornell Dumont.
    
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering)
		Ask him who Sol is ...
    
Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe he could help...
    
Betty follows Rita through the gate to the waiting cab. They
get in and the cab pulls away.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. CAB - DAY
    
Betty reaches and gently grabs Rita's shoulder. She speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

    
				BETTY
		Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
    
				RITA
			(whispering back)
		But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of
		Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why
		we shouldn't go see about Diane
		Selwyn... it's better not to get in
		trouble.
    
				BETTY
		You're not going to get in trouble.
		You're going to find out who you are.
		Finding out who you are gets you out of
		trouble.
    
Rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
INT. CAB - LATER
    
Betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand.
She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street.
    
				BETTY
		It should be around here...
    
Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(points)
		That's it ... 2590.
			(nudging Rita)
		Does it look familiar?
    
Rita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men
sitting in the front.
    
				RITA
		Don't stop!
    
				BETTY
		What is it? What do you see?!
    
				RITA
			(quietly - frantic)
		Those men in front, in the car.
    
				BETTY
		Do you know them?!
    
				RITA
		No... but...
    
				BETTY
			(to driver)
		Keep going. Go around to the back.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENT - BACK ALLEY - DAY
    
Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
    
				BETTY
		Selwyn ... number 12.
    
They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		It's this way.
    
They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
    
Both girls dive for the bushes.
    
The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(panting whisper)
		Now, you've got me scared.
    
Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
    

He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		See, I told you there was nothing to be
		afraid of!
    
They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
    
				RITA
		Oh no ... don't.
    
Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
    
				RITA (cont'd)
		No one's ...
    
Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Yes?
    
				BETTY
		Diane?
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Number 17.
    
				BETTY
		But it said #12.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		I switched apartments with her. She's in
		#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
		to the right.
    
The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		It's kind of hidden by the foliage.
    
Betty and Rita start to leave.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		She hasn't been around for a few days ...

    
				BETTY
		Well ... we'll leave her a note.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
			(starting toward them)
		I'll go with you. She's still got some of
		my stuff.
    
The phone rings from inside her bungalow.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
			(turning back)
		Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.
    
The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
    
				BETTY
		I guess you're not Diane.
    
Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
    
They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Still not home I guess.
    
The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.
    
				RITA
		I don't think...
    
				BETTY
			(looking around for anyone
			watching)
		C'mon help me in. I'll open the front
		door.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
    
				BETTY
		PUSH!!!

    
Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Meet you at the door.
    
Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I don't know if you want to come in here
		or not. There's some kind of horrible
		smell like... something...
    
Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.

Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows.
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. They move
slowly, looking around at everything as they go. Betty looks
to Rita to see if any of this is something she remembers.
Rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.

The Middle-Aged Woman is just shutting the door to her
bungalow. She walks quickly in the direction of Bungalow

INT. - BUNGALOW #17 - DAY
    
Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream
starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.
    
In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.

EXT. BUNGALOW #17 - DAY
    
The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard
something or not. She wonders, then turns and goes back to
her bungalow.
    
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.
    
Sounds, churning music.

INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY
    
Sounds, music churning continues.
    
Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding
the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets
Betty hold her. Music changes ...
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I know what you're doing.
    
				RITA
			(through uncontrollable sobs)
		What ... I..HAVE... to do.
    
				BETTY
		I know what you have to do, but let me do
		it.
    
Rita turns and looks up at Betty, her eyes red with crying.
Betty pulls her up facing her. Rita lets Betty take the
scissors. They look into each other's eyes. Betty gently
strokes Rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Let me do it.

Panning slowly across we see on the bathroom counter various
open bottles, used Q-tips, towels, combs, a brush, a bowl,
and lots of long strands of cut black hair. We continue
moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror. She has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.
Betty's reflection comes in beside Rita's. They stare at the
new Rita in the mirror.

		You look like someone else.

We move off the door of Aunt Ruth's apartment and crane
slowly up to the apartment above hers - WILKINS - the one
with the wayward dog. We move closer to Wilkins' apartment
and as we move in we hear a phone ringing.

INT. WILKINS' APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
    
Wilkins still in his pajamas, bathrobe and slippers from
morning slouches in an enormous stuffed chair and matching
ottoman, surrounded by piles of papers and coffee cups. His
Jack Russell Terrier wakes and stands at the sound of the
phone ringing on a side table next to Wilkins. Wilkins comes
out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.
    
				WILKINS
		Hello. Adam. How's it going? No, it's
		okay. Yeah, I'm working, but... they
		wanted this script a week ago. What?
		What's wrong with your house? The
		poolman? Sure, you can have the couch.
		No, it's no problem..it's just I
		gotta ... I gotta work. Any chance you
		could bring some food. No, I got plenty

Rita has just taken the hatbox from the closet shelf and is
setting it on the bed.
    
				BETTY
		What are you doing?
    
Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox
and removes her purse. She opens the purse and takes out the
money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.
    
				RITA
		You've been so good to me ... now we know
		why ... why I was so afraid. We know what
		kind of trouble I'm in. I shouldn't...
		ask you... I only have this to offer.
		I'll give you this if I can stay here for
		awhile. I don't know what else to do.
    
Betty moves across the bed to the side of Rita. She puts her
arm around Rita and holds her.
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I want you to stay here and you
		don't have to give me that money.
    
				RITA
		But I want to.
    
				BETTY
		No. We shouldn't touch that money. We
		don't know about that money. That might
		be dangerous money. You have to start all
		over again. You look like a brand new

		It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody

We drift along the red bricks past the payphone, along the

trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure. We move closer
to the figure. It is the bum and the bum sits. We move
closer and the bum's face fills the screen. It's face is
black with fungus. It's eyes turn and they seem to be red.

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               EXT. MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY

               A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of 
               the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man 
               gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE 
               NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up 
               suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his 
               shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He 
               wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around. 
               [Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK & 
               WHITE.]

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         I get outta the truck in this two-
                         bit town. I got no money and no 
                         prospects. What I need right now is 
                         a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a 
                         hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order 
                         they come...

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling 
               picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO 
               RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         ...Oh yeah, one other thing I need -- 
                         an angle.

               He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, 
               then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         I was thinking -- if it weren't for 
                         bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck 
                         at all...

                                     LANDLADY (O.S.)
                         Can I help you?

               The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding 
               the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap, 
               small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front 
               and clings with sweat to her generous curves.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         Either my luck had just changed, or 
                         Fate just bought me another round of 
                         trouble.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               The Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the 
               narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third 
               story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We 
               can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE:

                                     LANDLADY
                         ...not very fancy... house needs 
                         repairs... We haven't had a man around 
                         here for so long...

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         She kept yammerin' the whole time, 
                         but her hips were doing all the 
                         talking...

               The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs 
               and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and 
               tiny window. The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous 
               body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long. 
               His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the 
               door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying 
               with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         It couldn't 'a been any clearer what 
                         the set-up was. The next move was up 
                         to me...

               The Newcomer takes a step in the Landlady's direction --

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         Don't tell me!

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY

               CLOSE-UP of MUMFORD wincing.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (softer)
                         -- That's all the time we have. 
                         Sorry...
                              (indicates his watch)
                         ...next time.

               We see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a 
               therapist with a doctorate. It's modest, comfortable, neat, 
               with a calm, relaxed ambience. [The movie is now in COLOR.] 
               His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer 
               in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's 
               a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding 
               hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his 
               fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but 
               now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford.

                                     FOLLETT
                         I have eighteen more minutes!

                         I don't want to hear any more today.

                                     FOLLETT
                         Why not?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't 
                         you?

                                     FOLLETT
                         Well, I don't know... I only been 
                         seeing you --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Without trust, there's no point to 
                         any of this. You might as well not 
                         come.

                                     FOLLETT
                         Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't 
                         want to come --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Good, then go.

               INT. LILY'S CAFÉ- DAY

               Lunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window, 
               crossing from the two-story building that houses his office 
               on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is 
               also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter 
               to pick up some take-out. The Proprietor is a woman around 
               forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works.

                                     LILY
                         You're early... it's not ready. What 
                         happened?

                                     MUMFORD
                         My patient had to leave early.

                                     LILY
                         Who was that?

               She comes over to the register with an order. Mumford is 
               am[...] her, likes her a lot.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Does the phrase "nosy" have any 
                         meaning to you, Lily?

                                     LILY
                         I think it's like... inquisitive.

                         It was Henry Follett.

                                     LILY
                              (reacts)
                         Man, you see him a lot. And it's 
                         very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll 
                         be saying what his problem is.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What do you want to know?

                                     LILY
                         You're terrible. I'm never telling 
                         you anything.

               A Patron passes on the way out.

                                     PATRON
                         Hey, Doc... how's it going?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Fine, Vincent... how's yourself?

                                     LILY
                         How long you been in this town?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Oh, I don't know...

                                     LILY
                         Four months, two and a half weeks -- 
                         that's how long.
                              (Mumford gives her a 
                              look)
                         And you've already got more patients 
                         than those other two shrinks combined.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Lily, I don't think even you could 
                         know that --

               Lily sees something out the window.

                                     LILY
                         Look at that guy...

               Mumford turns to look out the window. A young man of about 
               30, in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, is skateboarding down the 
               street at high speed, weaving in and out amongst the cars. 
               He zips past the front of the restaurant.

                                     LILY
                         You know who that is, don't you?
                              (Mumford does not)
                         You really don't? That's Skip 
                         Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit 
                         by a truck, this whole town shuts 
                         down.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.

               LILY hands over Mumford's bagged order, rings it up. Back on 
               track:

                                     LILY
                         So, what makes you so popular? What's 
                         your secret?

                                     MUMFORD
                              (takes his bag to go)
                         You like me. How come?

                                     LILY
                         Not sure. Let me think about it.

               Mumford is smiling as he goes out. Another Patron, LIONEL 
               DILLARD, a lawyer, brings his check to Lily, watching Mumford 
               cross the street. Lily can't stand this guy.

                                     LIONEL
                         That's the new psychiatrist?

                                     LILY
                         Psychologist. He's not medical.

                                     LIONEL
                         Probably thinks he's pretty smart.

               Lily gives him a look as she takes his money.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               An overweight, teenage girl named NESSA WATKINS is on 
               Mumford's couch. She fidgets as she talks and can't decide 
               whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit 
               up and face him. She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps 
               taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy 
               handbag.

                                     NESSA
                         ...so he already had the tattoo that 
                         said, "Naomi Forever"... and now 
                         they're broken up, see, and he has 
                         to have it removed. But while the 
                         scar is still healing, or whatever 
                         you call it when you have a tattoo 
                         removed, he meets Chandra. And it's 
                         serious, immediate love. So in no 
                         time, he's gone from the most gorgeous 
                         model in the world to the most 
                         gorgeous actress in North America.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What do you mean, "in no time"?

                                     NESSA
                         In maybe three or four issues.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Weekly or monthly?

                                     NESSA
                         Monthly! God, how shallow do you 
                         think Brad is? Why do I waste my 
                         time telling you this stuff?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?

                                     NESSA
                         Don't do that thing...
                              (Mumford: what?)
                         ...that shrink thing.

                                     MUMFORD
                         It's a big part of the show.

               She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter, 
               but is afraid to actually break his rules.

                                     NESSA
                         You really need to let people smoke 
                         in here, you know. It's perverse. 
                         What are they paying you to see me?

               Mumford indicates "nothing".

                                     NESSA
                         The school board doesn't pay you? 
                         What kind of deal is that?

                                     MUMFORD
                         It's called pro bono.

                                     NESSA
                         Pro boner?
                              (he waits her out)
                         Pro bono, huh? For whose good, 
                         supposedly?

                                     MUMFORD
                         It's my bit for the community.

                                     NESSA
                         Fuck the community.
                              (he won't go for it)
                         There was this article my friends 
                         and I read. It was "25 Signs He's 
                         Great in Bed". It was very 
                         fascinating.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Where was this?

                                     NESSA
                         Where?... The New York Times. The 
                         first one was -- "he handles produce 
                         well." Which we already knew!
                              (an expression she 
                              uses)
                         The point is, you have a lot of the 
                         signs.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You been spying on me in the 
                         supermarket, Nessa?

                                     NESSA
                         Have women found you attractive?

               Mumford laughs.

                                     NESSA
                         I knew you wouldn't answer. I've 
                         been thinking about what you said 
                         last time. How me trying to lose 
                         weight -- and constantly not -- is 
                         like a lot of people with addictions. 
                         How maybe I can't lose the weight, 
                         ever...
                              (quietly)
                         Which we already knew...

                                     MUMFORD
                         That's not quite what I said --

                                     NESSA
                         It's a really weird thing for a shrink 
                         to say... and then you said maybe 
                         people'd be happier if they'd accept 
                         that some things don't change -- 
                         that it'd be some kind of a relief 
                         or something...

               Mumford waits.

                                     NESSA
                         Well, I guess I'm just a dumb bitch, 
                         but how depressing is that moment -- 
                         the moment when you give up?

               EXT. HIKING TRAIL, MOUNTAIN FOREST - MAGIC

               The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees 
               as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well.

               EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC

               Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the 
               edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle.

               WHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights 
               just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it 
               for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp 
               from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks 
               like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and 
               turns his head to watch the beam move about.

               WE CUT BACK WIDE. After a beat, Mumford settles back and 
               turns off the light.

               INT. SCATTERGOOD'S TAVERN - NIGHT

               The place is quietly busy with the regulars. Mumford has a 
               favorite spot at the far end of the bar. Right now he's 
               sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper.

               SKIP SKIPPERTON, the man on the skateboard, comes in. Everyone 
               in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here. Several patrons 
               greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around. 
               He's uncomfortable. He seems relieved when he spots Mumford 
               and heads back there. Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting 
               for his attention.

                                     SKIP
                         Hi.

               Mumford looks up, smiles. Skip offers his hand.

                                     SKIP
                         You're Doc Mumford.
                              (Mumford nods)
                         Skip Skipperton.

                                     MUMFORD
                         How are you?

                                     SKIP
                         Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been 
                         hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot 
                         about you.

               Mumford waits, friendly. Skip runs out of gas, gets uneasy, 
               glances around.

                                     SKIP
                         Do you think we could...? Can I buy 
                         you a drink?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               [...]

               LATER. IN A BOOTH near the back. They've been at it a while, 
               but nothing is clear to Mumford, yet. Skip keeps his voice 
               down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him.

                                     SKIP
                         ..."Find the need and fill it" my 
                         dad used to say -- I guess a lot of 
                         dads say that -- but I did and it 
                         just took off.

                                     MUMFORD
                         No kidding... Panda. Where'd that 
                         come from?

                                     SKIP
                         Panda? I've always liked giant 
                         pandas... I've been to China and 
                         seen them in the wild. That's the 
                         kind of thing I can do if I want... 
                         now. I can do pretty much anything I 
                         want to do these days.

               Skip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought 
               depresses him. He catches himself and snaps back --

                                     SKIP
                         So now we make 23% of the modems in 
                         the market, which is pretty good.

               Skip glances around, leans in, confidential.

                                     SKIP
                         When I was growing up here, the town 
                         was about dead. The timber business 
                         was played out... Panda changed all 
                         that. Now, just about everybody in 
                         town either works for the company or 
                         depends on it somehow. Which is kinda 
                         the problem...

               Mumford waits, watches. Skip gets uncomfortable.

                                     SKIP
                         Would you like another beer?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Nah... scotch.

                                     SKIP
                              (brightens, like a 
                              kid)
                         Far out. Single malt?
                              (gets up)
                         Can I pick it?

               Skip heads off to the bar. Mumford looks around. Everybody 
               is watching.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LATER. The bar crowd has thinned. Both Mumford and Skip have 
               had a few. In fact, Mumford is now carefully pouring them 
               each another drink from a bottle of Glensomething on the 
               table.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You want me... to be... your friend.

               Skip beams. Mumford leans forward in the same confidential 
               way Skip did before; he indicates that Skip should lean in 
               too. Mumford is almost whispering --

                                     MUMFORD
                         But that's not what's really going

                         ...What's really going on is... you 
                         have some problems and you want some 
                         therapy, but you feel it could be 
                         very bad for Panda Modem stock if 
                         word got out that you were having 
                         head problems.

               Skip confirms that's it.

                         Of course! That's exactly what I

                         Have you thought about getting a 
                         wife?

               Skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large "YES!", 
               but also total frustration and failure.

                         When Panda started to happen, I was 
                         dating women from New York, San 
                         Francisco, L.A. They came out of the 
                         woodwork. Models, actresses, venture 
                         capitalists... These were not the 
                         kind of girls who were interested in 
                         me before I hit it... And you know 
                         what I discovered? I discovered these 
                         girls did not love me for myself. 
                         The majority of them didn't even 
                         like me. But a lot of them would've 
                         gladly become Mrs. Skipperton for a 
                         while. Can you imagine that -- 
                         marrying someone just because they've 
                         got money?

               Mumford considers that.

                         since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...
                              (finally remembers)
                         ...thirteen! Right?
                              (Mumford: if you say 
                              so)
                         Now here's the question -- Your name 
                         is Mumford, too.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Is that the question?

                         You moved here from back East and

                         Is that right?
                              (Mumford shrugs)
                         Far out.

               Skip takes a few steps toward the men's room, then comes 
               back and leans down toward Mumford.

               Skip stumbles off to take a leak. Mumford takes a moment to 
               digest that. It's difficult.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Mumford is listening to Lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked 
               about him in the restaurant. Lionel is lying on the couch, 
               talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority 
               complex. Mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be 
               lasting an eternity.

                                     LIONEL
                         ...so I'm watching Brokaw and they've 
                         got some astronomer, this little 
                         limey know-it-all, and he's telling 
                         how, with this Himball telescope, 
                         they've discovered there are maybe 
                         400 million more galaxies than they 
                         thought there were. And I guess that's 
                         supposed to make me feel small? I'm 
                         supposed to feel insignificant? Is 
                         that the point? Because I can tell 
                         you it didn't.

               Mumfords eyes dart to look at --

               THE CLOCK on the bookshelf: 2:23

                                     MUMFORD
                         Lionel, since this is our first 
                         session together, maybe --

               Lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at 
               Mumford.

                                     MUMFORD
                         -- you can sit up and look at me if 
                         you'd like --
                              (Lionel waves that 
                              off and looks away)
                         -- maybe it would be helpful if you 
                         told me a little about what brought 
                         you here.

                                     LIONEL
                         Kind of impatient for a big-time 
                         headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout 
                         you let me explain it my own way...

               As Lionel goes on, Mumford's eyes again dart toward -- THE 
               CLOCK: still 2:23! Hold on it. Finally, it moves. Mumford's 
               eyes dart toward his desk --

               A deadly-looking letter opener in the shape of Excalibur 
               stands GLINTING LIGHT in a marble rendition of Arthur's stone.

                                     LIONEL
                         ...and in the dream, it's always the 
                         same, I wake up in my room from when 
                         I was I kid in Ohio, and I realize 
                         this is the day of the big exam at 
                         school...

               Mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's 
               going to drift off. He snaps back to life and stares hard at 
               the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting 
               to take hold. The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo --

                                     LIONEL
                         ...which is no problem for me, because 
                         I remembered it was coming and I've 
                         attended every class, so I'm totally 
                         prepared. Then I see myself running 
                         down the hall at school...

               MUMFORD'S GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionel's bald spot to the 
               gleaming letter opener.

               Mumford closes his eyes. We CUT TO:

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

               A boy, unmistakably the Young Lionel, runs down the deserted 
               hallway toward a bright doorway. [LIONEL'S DREAM has a BLUE 
               TINT.]

                                     LIONEL (V.O.)
                         ...but it's not really my school -- 
                         and this is very interesting -- it's 
                         the school from the next district --

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         -- Go on!

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

               Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and 
               stares alarmed.

                                     LIONEL (V.O.)
                         And even though I arrive a little 
                         bit early, everybody's already there. 
                         But the surprising part is --

               WHAT YOUNG LIONEL SEES: Everyone in the class, including the 
               Teacher in the front, is naked. The Teacher holds out an 
               exam toward Young Lionel.

                                     LIONEL (V.O.)
                         -- I'm the only one who's prepared!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               ALTHEA BROCKETT, a woman in her forties, sits on the couch 
               reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings. There 
               are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed, 
               woven carry-all.

               The door to Mumford's inner office opens with some force. 
               Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel, who 
               is getting up from the couch in some confusion.

                                     LIONEL
                         -- you crazy? You can't do this!

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sure I can, Lionel.

                                     LIONEL
                         I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I 
                         like my clients? I can't stand most 
                         of them! But I don't kick them out...

                                     MUMFORD
                         See that sign -- We retain the right 
                         to refuse service to anyone. I'm not 
                         going to charge you for this session, 
                         but I don't want to see you back 
                         here.

               Lionel looks around, but there is no such sign. He does spot 
               Althea watching the show from the couch.

                                     LIONEL
                         Don't you at least have a back door 
                         I can use?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Come out this way. There's no shame 
                         in getting a little therapy... is 
                         there, Althea?

               Althea stands up, smiling. She thinks Mumford is the bee's 
               knees.

                                     ALTHEA
                         Not at all. It takes guts, Lionel.

               Lionel steams by them in a black mood.

                                     LIONEL
                         Maybe some of us don't need this 
                         crap!

                                     MUMFORD
                         And it's the Hubble Telescope, not 
                         the Himball Telescope.

               Lionel bangs out the front door. Mumford motions Althea inside --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Jeez... what an asshole.

               Althea heads inside, giggling wildly. She can't get enough 
               of this guy.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE -DAY

               Althea is sobbing. Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the 
               box next to the couch. She wads it with her current one and 
               tries to stop crying. Mumford settles back in his chair, 
               patient.

                                     ALTHEA
                         What do they want from me?
                              (more sobbing)
                         What have I done that's so wrong?
                              (pulling it together)
                         They act as though they don't have 
                         their own peculiar things... They 
                         do! Believe me. Everybody's got 
                         something...
                              (looks at Mumford)
                         Even you probably have things.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Me more than most.

                                     ALTHEA
                         Why are they ganging up against me?

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'm not sure. But I think they're 
                         worried about you.

                                     ALTHEA
                         It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. 
                         He had nothing to do with this -- 
                         except pay, of course. He's always 
                         willing to pay. He's extremely 
                         generous.
                              (a long beat)
                         I'm so humiliated that my own children 
                         would threaten me.

                                     MUMFORD
                         How did they threaten you?

                                     ALTHEA
                         They said if I didn't get help, they 
                         wouldn't deal with me any more.
                              (a beseeching look)
                         What do you think about that?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Good kids.

               Althea stares at him a long moment. She knows he's right. 
               Tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks. She grabs 
               another Kleenex. In the midst of the torrent she tries to 
               talk, but it's undecipherable:

                                     ALTHEA
                         Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Hmm?

               Althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face.

                                     ALTHEA
                         I said... you must come out to the 
                         house for dinner on Thursday.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Really? You think so?

                                     ALTHEA
                         Yes. Jeremy will be home for the 
                         weekend. And you can meet the kids.

               Mumford considers, then nods his assent.

               EXT. MUMFORD'S STREET - MAGIC

               Mumford hurries up the sidewalk carrying two grocery bags. 
               He's late. The modest houses are close together on this pretty 
               street, which rises out of the main business district, seen 
               beyond Mumford.

               EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

               Mumford comes to the house where he lives. He heads down the 
               driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment.

               The front yard is completely fenced. Lily, the owner of the 
               restaurant, is almost visible in there working among the 
               greenery of a lush garden. Her friendly dog, AINGE, sees 
               Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around 
               Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him.

                                     MUMFORD
                         How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.

                                     LILY
                         Doc.
                              (doesn't look up)
                         Ainge...

               The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard. Mumford hurries 
               up the stairs.

               INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC

               Mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen 
               counter. He goes directly to the table by his main chair and 
               picks up the TV remote. He switches it on and changes the 
               channel. The opening segment of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is just 
               beginning. It previews the stories on that evening's episode -- 
               disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack 
               hosting.

               CLOSE ON MUMFORD'S FACE as he watches. Only when the whole 
               show has been previewed does he seem to relax. He leaves the 
               show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the 
               bags.

               INT. COOK'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY

               Mumford is comparing different stepladders. MR. COOK, the 
               sixty-ish proprietor, has been watching from a distance, but 
               now --

                                     COOK
                         Dr. Mumford.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (doesn't really know 
                              him)
                         Mr. Cook.

                                     COOK
                         Could you come with me please?

               Mystified, Mumford follows Cook through the door into the 
               back.

               BACK OF THE STORE. Cook motions for Mumford to take the seat 
               of honor in the work area, but Mumford prefers to stand. 
               Cook has a little trouble figuring how to start. Finally --

                                     COOK
                         I know I shoulda come to your office. 
                         I was gonna, actually, but then when 
                         you walked in here today...

                                     MUMFORD
                         Uh-huh.

                                     COOK
                         It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta 
                         problem.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What's that?

                                     COOK
                         We're not sure. She's been to all 
                         kinds of doctors in the city and 
                         they've said different things. Some 
                         of 'em are callin' it --
                              (wants to get this 
                              right)
                         -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest 
                         are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue 
                         Symptom...

                                     MUMFORD
                         Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

                                     COOK
                         That's it -- syndrome. So you know 
                         all about it?

                                     MUMFORD
                         No... a little. There's a lot of 
                         debate about it.

                                     COOK
                         Yeah, I got that. Some people think 
                         it's all in their heads.
                              (more intense)
                         It's been so bad she's had to move 
                         back here to Mumford and live with 
                         us. And I'm not sure that's the best 
                         thing, either...

                                     MUMFORD
                         Why's that?

                                     COOK
                         Oh... a lot of things. Several 
                         different factors. Will you see her, 
                         Doctor Mumford?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sure. Why don't you bring her up to 
                         my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.

               Cook nods, but looks worried.

                                     COOK
                         I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a 
                         mood. Do you ever go to somebody's 
                         house?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Generally that doesn't work out so 
                         well. It sends the wrong message to 
                         people who need to make a change.

               Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. But 
               he's worried.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5-
               foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder. Folks greet him. 
               Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Hello, Lionel.

                                     LIONEL
                         You've got to have the right ladder 
                         for the job. You don't know what 
                         you're doing, you can get yourself 
                         in trouble.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You're right, as usual. See you.

               Mumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who 
               watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small 
               medical building.

               INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

               DR. ERNEST DELBANCO, a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish, 
               vanity hair, and PHYLLIS SHEELER, a psychologist in her 
               thirties, sit on the doctor's comfortable furniture, 
               listening. The remains of their take-out lunch is on the 
               coffee table. They seem a little impatient with their as-yet-
               unseen visitor --

                                     LIONEL (O.S.)
                         ...completely inappropriate and highly 
                         unprofessional. Now I don't want to 
                         presume to tell you how to run your 
                         businesses --

                                     SHEELER
                         -- practices.

               Lionel is sitting across the room, making an ardent case --

                                     LIONEL
                         -- Whatever. Six months ago, you two 
                         were the only games in town. The 
                         value of your...
                              (mocking)
                         ..."practices" could be seriously 
                         undermined by this bozo. A town this 
                         size has only so many headcases to 
                         go around.

                                     DELBANCO
                         What exactly would you have us do, 
                         Lionel?

                                     LIONEL
                         Protect your turf! Check this guy 
                         out. I smell a rat, I tell you.

               Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look; they find Lionel 
               distasteful.

                                     SHEELER
                         Mr. Dillard, I'm sure Dr. Delbanco 
                         shares my gratitude for your concern. 
                         But I also know he'd agree that you 
                         misunderstand the nature of our 
                         calling to mental health. We're not 
                         in some... widget business, trying 
                         to crush our competition.

                                     LIONEL
                         What the hell's a widget?

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Lionel comes out of the office, miffed, and goes down the 
               stairs. A moment later, the door opens slightly and Delbanco 
               peeks out to make sure Lionel is gone. He closes the door on 
               us.

               INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Delbanco stands at the door looking across the room at 
               Sheeler.

                                     DELBANCO
                         What an asshole!

                                     SHEELER
                              (agrees)
                         Ernest, what do you think?

                                     DELBANCO
                         I think he's got a point.

               So does she.

               EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY

               Idyllic. The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by 
               lush woods. Standing about forty feet apart, Mumford and 
               Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and 
               forth. For quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the 
               wind, and the regular SLAP of ball into glove. Finally --

                                     SKIP
                         This is great!

               SLAP... SLAP.

                                     SKIP
                         This is exactly what I wanted.

               SLAP... SLAP.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Skip, you must have lots of people 
                         you can throw a ball with.

                                     SKIP
                         You'd be surprised. Most guys have 
                         kids or wives or girlfriends. They're 
                         busy. It's not as easy as you think.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Skip, you're the head of the whole 
                         deal here. Are they busier than you?

                                     SKIP
                         Well, you know... that's the thing. 
                         Like I said, just about everybody in 
                         town works for me. And it's just not 
                         the same asking someone to throw a 
                         ball when they work for you. It's 
                         like an order or something... And no 
                         one -- no one -- asks me.

               Mumford considers. SLAP... SLAP... SLAP.

                                     MUMFORD

                         your problem really that you're... 
                         lonely?

                         than this? Most guys would kill just 
                         to have someone do this with them 
                         whenever they like.

               Mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet 
               seen.

               REVERSE ANGLE: The baseball diamond is sitting in the vast, 
               lush grounds behind the PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS, a 
               brand new, distinctively original, high-tech office park. 
               Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is 
               in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face, black 
               eyes and ears, round body.

               Skip is suddenly self-conscious, embarrassed.

                         I would've traded any of it to have 
                         made the Mumford High varsity.

               Mumford takes that in. SLAP... SLAP.

                                     SKIP
                         So I guess Henry Follett is a patient 
                         of yours. He's my pharmacist.

                         Yeah.

                         Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.

               Skip is a little surprised to hear this from Mumford, but he 
               just throws the ball.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. 
                         Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned 
                         ones, from back when people cared 
                         about atmosphere and character.

                         Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot 
                         better than his real one. Nothing 
                         can live up to it. His wife got sick 
                         of it and left him. Took his kids 
                         with her.

                                     SKIP
                         I wondered what happened to her...

               Skip is fascinated, but a little uncomfortable. Mumford seems 
               oblivious, unusually talkative --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Of course, it's not that simple. 
                         There's something powerful going on 
                         there. We've got a lot of work to 
                         do.
                              (announcer voice)
                         It's hit to the warning track!

               For the first time, Mumford throws the ball way high, like a 
               long fly ball. Skip, delighted as a dog, takes off running 
               and just barely catches it on the run. He pegs it back to 
               Mumford.

                                     MUMFORD
                         In these fantasies, Henry Follett is 
                         played by a handsome guy with biceps. 
                         Can you imagine that? Where your 
                         self-esteem has to be?
                              (throws him the ball)
                         Man, I'd just like to move the guy 
                         to the point where he gets to appear 
                         in his own fantasies.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Silence. Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly, an unlit 
               cigarette in her mouth. Mumford looks at the clock -- 3:00 -- 
               and stands up, session over. Nessa quickly lights her 
               cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands 
               up too. She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly 
               to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened for 
               her, and goes out.

               Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he 
               walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it.

               MUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure we 
               see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door. 
               He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to 
               reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter --

               SOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat 
               disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage. She regards 
               Mumford with some resignation. Her father helps her out of 
               the chair. Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford.

               CLOSE ON Mumford, watching her.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               LATER. Mr. Cook is gone. Sofie is sitting up on the couch, 
               facing Mumford. She looks like she might pass out at any 
               moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Feel free to lie down. Most people 
                         do.

                                     SOFIE
                         I'd better not, I'll fall right to 
                         sleep. I think it's too soon for me 
                         to be sleeping with you.

               A joke. Mumford smiles.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What can you tell me about this?

                                     SOFIE
                         Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting 
                         to tell you...
                              (tiny smile, to herself)
                         ...about my exhaustion. I didn't 
                         really want to come. I'm not hopeful 
                         right now. But I couldn't take the 
                         look on my dad's face. He's a truly 
                         kind person, which is pretty 
                         extraordinary if you knew the story. 
                         He's the opposite of me, I guess -- 
                         all stamina and resolve.

               It's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a 
               bit into the couch.

                                     MUMFORD
                         When did you start to feel this way?

                                     SOFIE
                         About six months ago, I guess it is 
                         now. God, it seems like years. What 
                         a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before 
                         this happened -- when I'd hear people 
                         talk about this kind of thing -- I 
                         thought it was a bunch of bullshit.

               She sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- it's a 
               weak but magical sound.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What?

                                     SOFIE
                         You think that now! You think it's a 
                         bunch of hooey, don't you?

                                     MUMFORD
                              (unconvincing)
                         No.

                                     SOFIE
                         I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.

               Mumford is knocked off balance -- she's right. She saw him 
               clearly.

                                     SOFIE
                         That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother 
                         always says -- "Everything that's 
                         wrong with you is in your head." I 
                         suppose that's true.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Back when this started, was there 
                         anything unusual happening in your 
                         life? A change of job, of living 
                         situation... a loss of some kind?

                                     SOFIE
                         No... but it started one year to the 
                         day after my divorce became final. 
                         That's not too suspicious, is it?... 
                         But it wasn't like I was feeling bad 
                         about the divorce. Just the opposite.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Hmm.

                                     SOFIE
                         Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. 
                         Sometimes, with enough clues, it's 
                         possible to figure these things out.

                                     SOFIE
                         Even if you don't think it's real?

                                     MUMFORD
                         I don't know what's real and what 
                         isn't. That's never been my strong 
                         suit. But if you're tired all the 
                         time and you've had to give up the 
                         life you were having and come back 
                         home when you didn't want to... that's 
                         worth trying to fix. Maybe I can 
                         help you do that.

                                     SOFIE
                         What would you do?

                                     MUMFORD
                         We... we would try several things. 
                         But I need to see you a lot.

                                     SOFIE
                         I don't know. I barely made it today.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'll come to you. We'll try a little 
                         walking.

               Sofie suddenly looks defeated.

                                     MUMFORD
                         We'll take it slow. You'll never 
                         feel you can't handle it.

                                     SOFIE
                         I don't think I can afford it. I 
                         don't want my dad paying.

                                     MUMFORD
                         We'll work it out.

               Sofie gives him a long look.

                                     SOFIE
                         You have the best answer for 
                         everything.
                              (Mumford shrugs)
                         You seem so... hopeful. Are you always 
                         this sunny?

                                     MUMFORD
                         No one ever thought so. You must 
                         bring it out.

                                     SOFIE
                         Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone 
                         agrees my immune system's way down.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Maybe you'll catch it.

                                     SOFIE
                         Can I ask you something?
                              (Mumford: of course)
                         Didn't you tell my dad you didn't 
                         think it was a good idea to come to 
                         the patient?
                              (he admits it)
                         So what changed?

               Mumford just smiles. He doesn't want to tell her the truth -- 
               everything.

               EXT. BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

               A taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brockett's large and 
               beautiful house, which sits on an isolated lot on the 
               outskirts of town.

               INT. HALLWAY TO BACK VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

               Althea leads Mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed 
               house. The weird thing, what gets in the way of the decor, 
               is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked 
               everywhere. Many are unopened, but the rest are spilling 
               their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some 
               hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue-ordered 
               housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks. If 
               it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything 
               can), it is here. Althea sounds very nervous, cheery.

                                     ALTHEA
                         -- sorry everything's in such an 
                         uproar. Lots of big occasions coming 
                         up, and of course Christmas is only 
                         eight months away --
                              (giggles uncontrollably)
                         -- I don't know what's keeping Jeremy. 
                         You know he stays in the city three 
                         nights a week -- I guess I explained 
                         that...
                              (Mumford nods)
                         ...I know Katie's here, but I'm not 
                         so sure about Martin... I'm making 
                         dinner myself tonight, so I'll have 
                         to leave you, I'm afraid...

               EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

               They come out onto the wide porch, which commands a 
               spectacular view of the surrounding countryside. There's an 
               elaborate bar cart out here, which Althea points Mumford 
               toward.

                                     ALTHEA
                         I'm awful I know, but will you please 
                         help yourself. I just got a new copper 
                         sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and 
                         I'm afraid it'll be the death of us 
                         all if I don't get back in there...

               She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door. Mumford 
               gets a drink for himself, taking in the view. He sees 
               something out there.

               MUMFORD'S POV: Way in the distance, coming out of the woods 
               and down toward the house is a teenage boy.

                                     KATIE (O.S.)
                         You're the doctor, aren't you?

               Mumford turns to see that Althea's thirteen year old daughter 
               KATIE has silently appeared. Her jeans and little tee-shirt 
               are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her. Mumford nods.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You must be Katie. People call me 
                         Doc.

                                     KATIE
                              (motioning urgently)
                         C'mere. Quick... c'mon!

               Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the 
               porch.

               INT. SIDE HALL, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

               Mumford follows Katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance. 
               Here too, the walls are lined with boxes. She tiptoes to one 
               of two facing doors and waits for him.

               When he has joined her, she motions him back a foot for 
               safety, then carefully opens the door to a large walk-in 
               closet. Katie's caution becomes understandable: the space is 
               packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons 
               that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless 
               move. Katie closes the door, then pirouettes to the opposing 
               door, which she swings open freely -- REVEALING: what was 
               once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of 
               cartons, in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes.

               Mumford is taken aback. Katie points at packages and speaks 
               in a hypnotic WHISPER --

                                     KATIE
                         Cuddledown... Linen & Lace... Scully 
                         & Scully... Smith & Hawken... Plow & 
                         Hearth... Museum of Modern Art... 
                         Smithsonian Museum... J. Crew... 
                         Wolferman's... Hold Everything... 
                         Nieman Marcus... Coldwater Creek... 
                         Garnett Hill... Norm Thompson... 
                         Victoria's Secret... Sharper Image... 
                         Hammacher Schlemmer...

               EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

               Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner, MARTIN, 
               Althea's sixteen year old son, crosses the yard and comes up 
               onto the porch. He's wearing an old black leather jacket 
               with a lot of zippers, dirty jeans and black Converse All-
               Stars that are coming apart. In his hand, casually but 
               properly held, is a .22 caliber rifle. He looks Mumford over.

                                     MARTIN
                         Is this him?

                                     KATIE
                              (nods)
                         I showed him.

                                     MARTIN
                              (to Mumford)
                         Do you get it now? This is no joke.

               Mumford takes them both in and nods. He understands. Suddenly, 
               their manner changes, for the worse. What they can see that 
               Mumford cannot is JEREMY BROCKETT, Althea's husband, who has 
               come to the back screen door, with the bustle of a late 
               arrival.

                                     JEREMY
                         Hey, kids. Oh, hi.

               Seeing Mumford, Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his 
               hand. Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his 
               Armani outfit cost $4200 all in. His tone: hearty and strained --

                                     JEREMY
                         You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. 
                         Jeremy Brockett.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Doc. Nice to meet you.

                                     JEREMY
                         Sorry I'm late... traffic was a 
                         motherfucker. Have another drink, 
                         I'll be back in five.

               Jeremy goes inside. Martin and Katie exchange a look with 
               each other, then to Mumford. Martin goes inside.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - NIGHT

               LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda 
               carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish 
               and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea, 
               who immediately gets up.

                                     ALTHEA
                         I'll be back.

               She goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy 
               makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars --

                                     JEREMY
                         I think you'll like this. Know much 
                         about Cuban cigars?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Nope.

               Jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere 
               pullover and fires it up. After exhaling a huge cloud of 
               smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines.

                                     JEREMY
                         Makes the whole thing that much 
                         better.

               Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He 
               gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to 
               light up --

                                     JEREMY
                         Just hold the flame a little bit 
                         below the end... that's it... now 
                         just turn it slowly as you draw...

               Mumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar.

                                     JEREMY
                         Are you a man who likes to treat 
                         himself right?

                                     MUMFORD
                         I've had my moments.

                                     JEREMY
                         I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. 
                         Nobody ever said on their death bed -- 
                         "I treated myself too well."

                                     MUMFORD
                         I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, 
                         "I should have spent more time at 
                         the office."

                                     JEREMY
                         Fill in the blank. I don't mind the 
                         office. The point is, you only go 
                         'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be 
                         here now.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What do you do?

                                     JEREMY
                         Althea hasn't told you?

                                     MUMFORD
                              (no)
                         We've been talking about her, mostly.

                                     JEREMY
                         Well, in '85 four of us left our 
                         firms and formed an investment banking 
                         venture. We've got twenty-three people 
                         working there now.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You've done well.

               The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self-
               satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight 
               mind would dare. His response includes their lavish immediate 
               surroundings--

                                     JEREMY
                         We've done... very well. You know 
                         anything about addiction, Doc?

                                     MUMFORD
                         A little.

                                     JEREMY
                         Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say 
                         when you're in the red zone, you 
                         gotta score.
                              (watches Mumford smoke)
                         So what do you think?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Tastes good.

                                     JEREMY
                         No... I mean about Althea. About 
                         her...
                              (makes a face)
                         ...behavior. Do you think you can 
                         fix her up?

                                     MUMFORD
                         What do you think's wrong with her?

                                     JEREMY
                         She's gone weird is what's wrong 
                         with her. Out of control. Probably 
                         from living out here in Mayberry.

               Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a 
               mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. Mumford watches, 
               fascinated by this guy.

                                     JEREMY
                         You're the doctor, what do you think?

                                     MUMFORD
                         She seems very unhappy.

               Jeremy gives him a look, as if to say "duh."

                                     JEREMY
                         I think we all knew that, professor. 
                         The question... the real --
                              (drawn out, stoned)
                         -- quest-tio-nee... is... why?

               Mumford looks at him a long time.

               EXT. ROAD INTO MUMFORD - NIGHT

               Jeremy Brockett's Mercedes 500 SL whips around a curve.

               INT. BROCKETT'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

               Martin is driving Mumford back to town.

                                     MARTIN
                         But you know how to drive?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sure.

                                     MARTIN
                         Got a license?
                              (yes)
                         But no car?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Don't need it.

                                     MARTIN
                         I just got my license two weeks ago.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You're good.

                                     MARTIN
                         I been drivin' since I was twelve.

                                     MUMFORD
                         That would explain it.

                                     MARTIN
                         Can you help Mom?

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'm trying.

                                     MARTIN
                              (intense)
                         Got to.

               They drive in silence for a bit. Then --

                                     MARTIN
                         Nessa Watkins... She comes to you, 
                         doesn't she? You're treating her, 
                         right?

               Mumford gives him a surprised look, then acknowledges it.

                                     MARTIN
                         What's wrong with her?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Is she a friend of yours?

                                     MARTIN
                         No... sort of. Man, she could be 
                         cool, but all she does is get wrecked 
                         and do all the guys. She's blowin' 
                         them in the parking lot.

               Mumford knew that.

                                     MARTIN
                         A person's got to hate themselves to 
                         act like that.

               Mumford regards Martin with respect, then turns to look out 
               front. After a few moments --

                                     MARTIN
                         Have you ever met a bigger shithead 
                         than my stepfather?

               EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

               Lily is walking Ainge as the Mercedes pulls up and Mumford 
               gets out. Ainge runs happily around the car and puts his 
               paws up on the driver's door to greet Martin; we HEAR the 
               clicking SCRATCH of his nails on the surface. Martin rubs 
               the dog's head.

                                     LILY
                         Ainge!

                                     MARTIN
                         That's okay. Jeremy won't mind. Good 
                         dog.

                                     LILY
                         Ainge!

               The dog obediently leaves Martin and runs back to Lily. 
               Mumford waves as Martin pulls away.

                                     LILY
                              (to Ainge)
                         Do we run into the street? No, I 
                         didn't think so.
                              (looks after Martin)
                         Nice car. How's that place?

                                     MUMFORD
                         It's a pretty piece of land.

               They walk up the block with the dog.

                                     LILY
                         And the Brocketts?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Horror show. What'd you do tonight?

                                     LILY
                         It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call 
                         in the National Guard.
                              (he nods)
                         Then I did my laundry... watched 
                         20/20.

                                     MUMFORD
                         ...And?

                                     LILY
                         Shocking. Did you know the government 
                         is wasteful?
                              (Mumford reacts)
                         You heard it here first. Oh, and 
                         being a supermodel... it's no walk 
                         in the park.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Why do you watch?

                                     LILY
                         No gentleman caller, Doc.
                              (they turn back)
                         Not that I care. I've had it with 
                         men. They're so fascinated by their 
                         own crap. Took me four years to get 
                         the last one out. Almost turned me 
                         into a dyke... These days my idea of 
                         a hot date is a long shower by myself 
                         before bed. Now that feels good. And 
                         you don't have to do all that... 
                         listening.

               Mumford laughs.

                                     LILY
                         Oops... sorry. I guess that's the 
                         story of your life.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               TIGHT ON COMPUTER SCREEN. A health information "library" 
               website has been called up on Mumford's office computer. 
               Right now it's beginning to spew information about "CHRONIC 
               FATIGUE SYNDROME" -- Definitions, Signs and Symptoms, 
               Diagnostic Measures, etc.

               Mumford is hunched over the computer, reading avidly. His 
               printer is churning out hard copies.

               EXT. FRONT PORCH, COOK HOUSE - DAY

               Mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie. 
               He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively.

                                     SOFIE
                         I'm not making any promises.

                                     MUMFORD
                         We'll turn back anytime you want.

                                     SOFIE
                              (seeing something)
                         Oh boy... this should be interesting.

               Mumford looks out toward the street. A woman in her fifties 
               is turning into the front walk. She stares at them, unsmiling, 
               as the two parties converge. She is MRS. COOK.

                                     SOFIE
                         Hello, Mother. I want you to meet 
                         Dr. Mumford.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Mumford... like the town?

                                     MUMFORD
                              (offering his hand)
                         Yes. It's nice to meet you, Mrs. 
                         Cook.

               She finally takes his hand, but it's not friendly.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         What's happening here?

                                     SOFIE
                         We're going for a walk.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Do you think that's a good idea?

                                     SOFIE
                         Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself 
                         completely in his hands. For today, 
                         anyway.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         What kind of doctor are you?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Ph.D., psychologist.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Oh... not a real doctor.

                                     MUMFORD
                         That's right, the fake kind.

               Mrs. Cook is not amused. Sofie pulls on Mumford.

                                     SOFIE
                         We'd better go or I'm liable to bail 
                         on the whole thing.

               Mrs. Cook steps aside as they move up the walk.

               EXT. SIDEWALK, NEAR THE COOK HOUSE - DAY

               Mumford and Sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block. In 
               the background, Mrs. Cook watches for awhile before going 
               inside.

                                     SOFIE
                         Mom's such a cutie.

                                     MUMFORD
                         People usually have to get to know 
                         me before they hate me.

                                     SOFIE
                         She's not in a bad mood. She's like 
                         that all the time.
                              (a beat)
                         It doesn't bother me anymore. It's 
                         my dad and my brother I worry about.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Maybe... but you're the one whose 
                         ass is dragging.

                                     SOFIE
                              (laughs)
                         Is that the technical description of 
                         what I've got?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Is she against you getting help?

                                     SOFIE
                         We don't discuss it.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Something's bothering her.

                                     SOFIE
                         Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, 
                         especially, but Dad, of course. She 
                         thinks my brother's all right, but 
                         she didn't expect much. It's what 
                         happens when you "marry beneath 
                         yourself"...

               Sofie suddenly seems to be fading.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Please... forgive me.

                                     SOFIE
                         What?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Negative thinking makes everything 
                         more difficult. If you're going to 
                         have enough strength to do this, we 
                         have to talk only about positive 
                         things. All right?

               She looks at him, unsure if he's serious. It seems so corny. 
               But she agrees.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Okay then... Are you positive your 
                         mother's a bitch?
                              (she laughs, surprised)
                         Just kidding.

                                     SOFIE
                         You've got a funny idea of funny.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (seems worried)
                         I've offended you!

                                     SOFIE
                         No.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Really? What would it take?

               She laughs again; surprised again. He's got her off balance 
               makes a "rim shot" sound.

                                     SOFIE
                         Is this the treatment?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sorry... I'm done.

                                     SOFIE
                         'Cause I'll tell you, none of the 
                         others have tried this approach.

               They've come to the corner. He gestures to ask -- "shall we 
               cross?" She considers for quite a while, gauging her strength, 
               then, still on his arm, steps off the curb --

                                     SOFIE
                              (absurdly unconvincing)
                         Hey, 'Just do it!'

               THEY CROSS OUT OF FRAME as we HEAR:

                                     MUMFORD (O.S.)
                         I want you to tell me all your 
                         symptoms.

               EXT. PATH BY RIVER - DAY

               ANOTHER DAY. They're dressed differently. Sofie seems more 
               vigorous.

                                     SOFIE
                         I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Be specific.

                                     SOFIE
                         Well... I'm tired all the time, 
                         obviously. I always feel like taking 
                         a nap. But when I try to sleep, I 
                         have trouble.
                              (Mumford nods)
                         My muscles ache. And my joints. I 
                         feel like an old person, or like I 
                         did back when I used to work out too 
                         hard... What else?...

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. Under the list of Signs and 
               Symptoms: "Sore throat."

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         Sore throat?

                                     SOFIE (V.O.)
                         Uh-huh.

               ON THE SCREEN: "Low grade fever... Painful lymph glands... 
               Irritability..."

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         Low grade fever?

               EXT. PATH BY RIVER - DAY

               Sofie nods.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Painful lymph glands?
                              (yes)
                         Forget fulness... irritability... 
                         depression?

                                     SOFIE
                         Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... 
                         I get confused.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yeah, most people have that. It's 
                         confusing here.

                                     SOFIE
                         Where?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Life.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

               ANOTHER DAY. Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightest 
               set of calisthenics ever devised. Now they're doing waist 
               bends and arm waving. Even so, it's taking everything Sofie's 
               got.

                                     SOFIE
                         I don't know if I mentioned the 
                         headaches.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Did you get headaches before this?
                              (Sofie: yes)
                         But you get more now? Or more severe?

                                     SOFIE
                         No, not really. They're about the 
                         same. My marriage was one long 
                         headache.

                                     MUMFORD
                         So the headaches may not even be a 
                         part of this?

               She considers that, reluctantly agrees.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I can give myself a headache 
                         instantly.

                                     SOFIE
                         Is that like a party trick?

                                     MUMFORD
                         All I have to do is have two 
                         conflicting thoughts at the same 
                         time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking 
                         these walks is going to help Sofie 
                         get better.' But then I'll also think -- 
                         'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these 
                         walks and you're kidding yourself 
                         about the benefits.'

               Sofie's not sure how to take that. She looks away.

                                     MUMFORD
                         There... I've given myself a real 
                         whopper.

                                     SOFIE
                         You actually address yourself by 
                         name in your thoughts?
                              (Mumford laughs)
                         So you really think having two 
                         opposing ideas in your head does 
                         some kind of damage?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two 
                         different directions at once. It 
                         makes tiny little tears in our fabric.

                                     SOFIE
                         Well then, my life has been some 
                         kind of huge rip.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY

               The handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the 
               steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel 
               thrown over his shoulder. He goes into the bathroom off the 
               second floor hall and begins to wash up. [Again, Follett's 
               fantasy world is in BLACK & WHITE.]

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         The town was a rube's heaven, but I 
                         found work my first day out down at 
                         Old Man Sutter's gas station and 
                         diner. I knew his stacked young wife 
                         was going to be a problem, but, hey, 
                         life is full of problems. Back at 
                         the boarding house, I was washing up 
                         when I heard a load of yellin' and --

               IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, the Newcomer's POV: a nubile teenager, 
               17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up 
               the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down 
               at her mother. Her dialogue distant and echoey:

                                     LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER
                         ...get off my case! You don't like 
                         any of my friends...

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         ...I got my first look at the 
                         landlady's daughter.

               The LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER looks up and sees the Newcomer 
               watching her through the half-open bathroom door. She gives 
               him a petulant, white-hot look, then turns on her heel and 
               goes into her room at that end of the hall. She bangs her 
               door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot. The 
               Newcomer, still watching in the bathroom mirror, now has a 
               view of the bureau mirror in the Landlady's Daughter's room. 
               In there, seemingly oblivious, the girl quickly strips off 
               the top of her outfit, revealing a '50's-era white bra.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         Lucky for me, she was plenty upset 
                         but not too careful.

               Suddenly, in mirror reflection of mirror, the Landlady's 
               Daughter meets the Newcomer's smoldering stare and her lip 
               begins to curl.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         Or maybe it wasn't an accident at 
                         all --

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         Mr. Follett.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         -- 'cause in that instant I saw the 
                         beginning of a vixen's smile and I 
                         knew --

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         Henry!

               Mysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut, 
               cutting off the Newcomer's view. He looks with surprise into 
               his mirror -- it suddenly shatters.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward 
               Mumford, agitated.

                                     FOLLETT
                         What?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Stop now.

                                     FOLLETT
                         Why? I'm paying for this.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Not for this. Not me, you're not.

                                     FOLLETT
                              (challenging)
                         You find it distasteful, don't you?

                                     MUMFORD
                         It doesn't matter how I feel about 
                         it. It's how you feel about it that 
                         matters.

                                     FOLLETT
                         I enjoy it. Does that make me some 
                         kind of pervert? Just because a man 
                         has a rich imaginative life --

                                     MUMFORD
                         You didn't come to me because you 
                         have a rich imagination.

                                     FOLLETT
                         No?

                                     MUMFORD
                         You came because it's taking over. 
                         You're in its grip.

                                     FOLLETT
                         I never said that.

               Mumford's tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Where's your wife, Henry?

               Follett flinches, settles back down onto the couch, sulking.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Where's your wife, Henry?

                                     FOLLETT
                         Go to hell.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (softer)
                         I didn't hear you.

               Follett mutters something to himself, then is silent until --

                                     FOLLETT
                         We got divorced.
                              (petulant)
                         I had to get rid of her. She couldn't 
                         satisfy me.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (shouts, Follett jumps)
                         What?!

               Follett seems to shrink in size. They've been here before 
               and he doesn't like it.

                                     FOLLETT
                              (softly)
                         I was... never satisfied.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (normal again)
                         Now we're back on track.

               Again, Follett says something under his breath.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What's that?

                                     FOLLETT
                              (long beat)
                         You are so mean.

               EXT. HIKING TRAIL - MAGIC

               Mumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion. He 
               comes around a bend and is surprised to find Skip waiting 
               for him, looking serious.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Hey, Skip.

                                     SKIP
                         Doc. I know we're not supposed to 
                         get together till Wednesday...

                                     MUMFORD
                         That's all right. What's on your 
                         mind?

               Mumford indicates that Skip should walk with him up the trail.

                                     SKIP
                         How many sessions have we had now, 
                         Doc?
                              (Mumford tries to 
                              remember)
                         Six. And it's been good... like we 
                         were two buddies hanging out. Just 
                         shootin' the shit.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yep.

               They walk in silence for a while.

                                     SKIP
                         This is really hard. Everything I 
                         want to say is hard...

               EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC

               Mumford and Skip come out of the trees, climb onto the big 
               rock, and settle down. The sun is falling over the town of 
               Mumford.

                                     SKIP
                         ...We're like friends, almost... who 
                         trust each other.

               He checks Mumford's reaction. Mumford nods, offers Skip water, 
               who turns it down. Mumford takes a swig.

                                     SKIP
                         I want to tell you something, Doc, 
                         but before I do, I need to ask you a 
                         question... Because, for me to tell 
                         you this thing -- well, I haven't 
                         told anybody about this. It's the 
                         biggest secret I've got.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sometimes it's best to keep a few 
                         things just for ourselves.

                                     SKIP
                         You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I 
                         supposed to be able to tell you 
                         everything?

                                     MUMFORD
                         It's just a thought.

               Skip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below.

                                     SKIP
                         That really relates to the thing I 
                         want to ask you... I've noticed that 
                         sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes, 
                         when we're hanging out, throwin' the 
                         ball... or that time we went 
                         bowling... sometimes you'll like --
                              (gets it out fast --)
                         -- tell me things about your other 
                         patients.

               Mumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it 
               silently. Now Skip is even more nervous.

                                     SKIP
                         Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't 
                         know all that much about psychology 
                         or therapy or... ethics, so maybe 
                         there's something I missed... or 
                         something...

                                     MUMFORD
                         You're concerned that maybe I can't 
                         be trusted with a secret.

                                     SKIP
                         I trust you. Definitely. No question. 
                         But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I 
                         mean, you're not supposed to tell 
                         anyone about your patients' 
                         problems... are you?

               Mumford looks at Skip for a long moment.

                                     MUMFORD
                         That is correct, Skip. I'm going to 
                         have to take a long look at that.

               The conversation seems to end there. Skip's not sure where 
               to go next. Finally --

                                     SKIP
                         Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell 
                         you --

                         -- Skip. Knowing what you do about 
                         me --

                                     SKIP
                         Doc, I trust you! You've listened to 
                         me better than anybody... maybe ever.
                              (leans in, intense)
                         And this secret I've got, I can't 
                         stand it anymore. I don't know if 
                         I'm some kind of --

               Skip looks around at the darkening woods, though clearly 
               there's no one around.

                                     SKIP
                         -- I don't know if I'm a pervert or 
                         what. It's taken me this long to get 
                         where I can come out and say it... I 
                         can't back away now. I can't spend 
                         another day not knowing if I'm nuts.

               Skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself.

                                     SKIP
                         All right, I'm just gonna tell you, 
                         as simple and direct as I can.
                              (one last spasm of 
                              doubt)
                         And you understand that this is a 
                         big secret? Just between us?
                              (Mumford does)
                         Okay. You know I've got this gift 
                         for certain kinds of... machines.

                         That's right. And you also know that 
                         even though I make 23% of the modems 
                         in the world... I cannot make one 
                         simple connection with any woman who 
                         could truly love me.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Okay... let's say that, for now.

                         It's true, believe me. So... do you 
                         know what I've been doing, all alone, 
                         in my workshop, for almost two 
                         years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill-
                         It. How I spend my every solitary 
                         hour?

               Mumford shakes his head, "no."

                         No, what I've been working on, what 
                         the world really needs and no one 
                         has been able to create --

                         functional... sexual surrogate slash 
                         companion.

               Mumford tries to put that all together. Finally --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Slash what?

                         A doll?

                                     SKIP
                         No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm 
                         talking about much, much more than a 
                         doll. The world has never seen what 
                         I'm talking about... except maybe in 
                         the movies.

               Mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun 
               finally sinks below the horizon. He looks back at Skip.

                                     MUMFORD
                         How's it coming?

                         You don't think I'm insane?

                              ("no")
                         And that's your secret?
                              (Skip: "yes")
                         You meant -- like a trade secret?

                                     SKIP
                         No, Doc, a private secret! It's 
                         perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- 
                         Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sounds like kind of a good idea.

                                     SKIP
                              (nonplussed)
                         Really?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Definitely.

               It's getting dark fast now. Mumford reaches into his bag and 
               takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. He fits the straps 
               carefully over his head.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Skip, that's not much of a secret.

                                     SKIP
                              (hurt)
                         It's not?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Oh, it's okay. It's just not something 
                         to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't 
                         want people knowing -- and believe 
                         me, it's safe with me -- but on the 
                         scale of dirty little secrets, I'd 
                         give it, say... a two.

               Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the 
               dusk. Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You want to know a secret? I'll tell 
                         you a secret. Since it's just between 
                         us and all...

               Skip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically.

                                     MUMFORD
                         The secret, Skip, is this -- I am 
                         not now, nor have I ever been... a 
                         psychologist.

               At first, Skip thinks he's misunderstood Mumford. But in the 
               huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard 
               right. Mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets 
               up.

                                     MUMFORD
                         We'd better get going. Just follow 
                         my light. And, Skip, watch your step.

               EXT. MUMFORD'S PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

               This porch is directly above Lily's porch. Mumford and Skip 
               sit nursing beers. There's a cooler on the floor. Mumford's 
               legs are propped up on the porch railing

               Mumford takes a drink of beer.

                         It matters to me.

               Mumford gestures: "sorry, no can do."

                                     SKIP
                         I've told you a lot of private stuff.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I can tell you anything else.

                                     SKIP
                         What about everything? How did this 
                         happen?

               Mumford looks at Skip, considering. He takes a long pull 
               from his beer, then looks at the frosty bottle.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Did you know that every species of 
                         mammal has found some way to drug, 
                         inebriate, or anestnetize itself? 
                         Even if it's just banging its head 
                         against a rock. Seems to be some 
                         natural urge... to get away for a 
                         while.
                              (one more look at 
                              Skip)
                         I've had it for as long as I can 
                         remember. The first place I wanted 
                         out of was home...

               AS MUMFORD TALKS we SEE IMAGES FROM HIS PAST, all FROM 
               MUMFORD'S POV. We do not see him in the scenes. Instead, 
               everyone else in the scene RELATES TO THE CAMERA AS MUMFORD, 
               even if they're just ignoring him.

               EXT. MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD HOME, BALD KNOB, WEST VIRGINIA - 
               MAGIC

               MOVING FAST (MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD POV) toward the back door 
               of a rundown, little house in a poor mining community. We 
               reach the back door and bang inside --

               INT. MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD HOME - MAGIC

               The cramped interior is grimy and depressing. MUMFORD'S MOTHER 
               worse for wear, has just put a glass of liquor on the sink 
               and returned her attention to the smoking stovetop. She 
               glances briefly at Mumford and greets him pleasantly, clearly 
               drunk. Suddenly, her attention shifts and we -- PAN TO THE 
               FRONT DOOR which is opened roughly by MUMFORD'S FATHER, a 
               coal miner whose face still shows the grime of his work. But 
               it's his scary scowl that impresses. His eyes take in his 
               wife (and her drink) but he says nothing. He barely gives 
               Mumford a glance as he drops his lunch pail on the table and 
               disappears into another room.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         I thought I had the best parents in 
                         Bald Knob, West Virginia... till I 
                         was seven years old and got a look 
                         at some others. They weren't bad 
                         folks...

               AT THE DINNER TABLE. Across the table, MUMFORD'S OLDER SISTER 
               eats with her head down. On the right, Mumford's Mother is 
               picking at her food. Mumford's POV shifts to his Father, who 
               is yelling something at his wife.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         ...but they were real unhappy about 
                         being who they were...

               Now, his Father looks suddenly at Mumford; his hand shoots 
               out to slap Mumford's face, and the IMAGE GOES BLACK, then 
               immediately FADES UP AGAIN on --

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

               TIGHT ON A TEST PAPER being laid on an old-fashioned student 
               desk. Scrawled in red pencil at the top: "A -- Outstanding!"

               TILT UP to the old classroom, full of kids getting their 
               tests back. ACROSS THE AISLE, looking at camera with disgust, 
               is a sixteen year old boy, MUMFORD'S CLASSMATE.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         It made no sense that school came 
                         easy for me... I didn't do much work, 
                         and there was a proud tradition in 
                         my family of being really dumb. My 
                         friends didn't like it much. It made 
                         them distrust me...

               EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

               FROM INSIDE A HELMET: the brutal chaos of crashing bodies in 
               a Friday night high school football game. Mumford is violently 
               hit. Our view is smashed so deep into the muddy turf that 
               again the IMAGE GOES BLACK, then quickly FADES UP AGAIN on --

               INT./EXT. LOVER'S LANE, WOODS - NIGHT

               TIGHT ON A CAN OF "IRON CITY" BEER in MUMFORD'S POV as he 
               puts it on the roof of a green Nash Rambler and ducks into 
               the back seat. In the shadows is a teen-age girl, MUMFORD'S 
               DATE. As Mumford moves toward her, she flames a Bic lighter 
               and gleefully lights a fat joint; her blouse is unbuttoned 
               and gaping.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         On the other hand, it made some of 
                         my classmates like me better... I 
                         don't know what it was in me, maybe 
                         some genes from my mom, maybe some 
                         discomfort with myself, but early on 
                         I was drawn to any substance that 
                         made me numb...

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

               Graduation Ceremonies. MUMFORD'S POV moving across a platform 
               toward the diploma being proffered by the PRINCIPAL. PAN TO 
               Mumford's Parents, dressed up and proud, in the audience.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         When I got a scholarship to go out 
                         of state to college, I was the first 
                         one in my extended family who'd gone 
                         beyond high school. At graduation, 
                         my folks looked like a normal, happy 
                         couple, which I guess they were about 
                         10% of the time... out in public.

               INT. UNIVERSITY DORMITORY HALLWAY - DAY

               TIGHT ON A DORM ROOM DOOR as it is pushed open. MUMFORD'S 
               NEW ROOMMATE, a crazed, middle-class doper, has his stuff 
               spread around and is settled in the midst of the chaos. He 
               looks up at the arriving Mumford with a maniacal, stoned 
               smile.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         My roommate was from a planet I had 
                         never heard of called Scarsdale, 
                         where everything was the opposite of 
                         West Virginia...

               INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

               TIGHT ON A BONG filling with white smoke. We FOLLOW IT UP 
               THE TUBE to a PRETTY COED, who inhales deeply, then blows a 
               seductive cloud directly at Mumford. The room is full of 
               partying students.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         All the other kids, in fact, seemed 
                         to know things I didn't. They were 
                         friendly enough, but in four years, 
                         I never got over feeling that I had 
                         sneaked in... and was about to be 
                         exposed as the hillbilly and imposter 
                         I actually was.

               INT. BEDROOM, STUDENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Funky decor, red scarf over the lamp creating a sexy glow. 
               MUMFORD'S POV moves toward an undulating shape hidden by a 
               sheet on the bed. He reaches out and lifts the edge to REVEAL 
               the Pretty Coed, now naked, giggling, her extended hand 
               offering a tab of acid right up to camera.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         The thing that always made those 
                         feelings go away was... fun. Fun was 
                         drugs, fun was sex, fun was 
                         aggressively doing nothing. The only 
                         problem I had with degenerate, self-
                         destructive behavior was... I couldn't 
                         get enough of it.

               INT. UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM - DAY

               A PROFESSOR approaches camera and lays a fresh examination 
               on the desk in front of Mumford. The problem is -- Mumford 
               is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination 
               paper keeps changing shape.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         All that fun eventually had an impact 
                         on the work I was doing. I figured, 
                         what the hell, it was only college, 
                         after all. I'd straighten up when I 
                         went out in the real world...

               INT. OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               TIGHT ON SEVERAL AMPHETAMINE CAPSULES being dumped into 
               Mumford's palm over a water fountain. They disappear toward 
               camera as we dip down toward the stream of water.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         I didn't want to jump into my career 
                         right out of college. And since I 
                         had no career, that turned out to be 
                         not much of a problem...

               MUMFORD'S POV lifts from the fountain and turns to the 
               endless, deserted corridor of the huge building. We begin 
               TRACKING DOWN the hall, checking out the various doorways. A 
               Cleaning Crew appears far up ahead.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         I had a series of challenging jobs 
                         over the next few years...

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               We PAN from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage 
               containers, and MOVE TOWARD THEM.

               INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

               TIGHT ON TWO LINES of cocaine. We DIP TOWARD THEM, then UP 
               AGAIN and they're gone. PAN to REVEAL we're in a closet off 
               the brightly-lit office of an all-night gas station. A PATRON 
               is waiting impatiently out by the pumps.

               EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

               BACK TO PRESENT. Skip watches Mumford intently.

                                     MUMFORD
                         ...pizza delivery, pipe fitting, 
                         pest control... lots of jobs that 
                         started with the letter "p". For 
                         some reason, I kept losing these 
                         jobs.
                              (takes a swig of beer)
                         The only mind-altering substance I 
                         never had a problem with was alcohol. 
                         I never got drunk. I didn't like the 
                         feeling. But really, when you're as 
                         fucked up as I was... big deal.

               Mumford stands up and stretches, then sits on the railing 
               facing Skip.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Eventually, doing all these different 
                         jobs, I noticed something. For some 
                         reason, probably because I was too 
                         stoned to talk, everywhere I went --

               INT./EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS-- TALKING HEADS

               We see various CO-WORKERS from Mumford's jobs. The 
               environments are radically different, but the activity is 
               always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his 
               heart out to camera.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         -- people would talk to me, tell me 
                         everything... their stories, their 
                         problems, their innermost thoughts. 
                         Sometimes they'd pretend they needed 
                         advice, but mostly people just wanted 
                         someone to listen.

               INT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER HOUSE - DAY

               MUMFORD'S MOVING POV as he crawls into the darkness, an 
               insecticide sprayer ahead of him. He pushes at a cinderblock --

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         Anyway, one day I was spraying for 
                         termites when I had a vision --

               The cinderblock tips over and a swarm of scary-looking spiders 
               comes rushing out toward camera.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         -- it was time to put my college 
                         degree to work and get a job with a 
                         desk.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICES - DAY

               FROM BEHIND A DESK in the middle of a huge sea of desks.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         I took the civil service exam and 
                         found myself working at the Internal 
                         Revenue Service, District 14, Central 
                         Administrative Office. I started off 
                         as a general records clerk...

               SERIES OF SHOTS: computer records scrolling rapidly, paper 
               files being pulled, documents being routed.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         I guess the standards weren't too 
                         high there, because my superiors got 
                         excited and pushed me to take the 
                         advancement tests...

               INT. YMCA GYM - NIGHT

               An intense basketball game. The ball zips from behind camera 
               (Mumford) to an older guy, MUMFORD'S SUPERVISOR, under the 
               basket; he lays it in easily, then comes over to high-five.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         One guy in particular thought I should 
                         be a Revenue Officer. There was more

               INT. KITCHEN TABLE, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT (PAST) - NIGHT

               A COCAINE MILL is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut 
               in MUMFORD'S POV; the steady grinding begins. Spread across 
               the messy kitchen table is the regular user's paraphernalia.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         ...since, even though I was certain 
                         I could stop anytime I wanted, I had 
                         developed a real affection for 
                         cocaine. It was my favorite hobby I 
                         had ever had.

               INT. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OFFICES - DAY

               MUMFORD'S POV SHIFTS around the office. First, he's looking 
               at an irate TAXPAYER yelling across a desk at a REVENUE 
               OFFICER, who remains unruffled --

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         But I sure didn't want to be a Revenue 
                         Officer, where you were face to face 
                         abusing -- and getting abused -- all 
                         day long...

               His POV PANS with a couple of intense COLLECTION AGENTS who 
               pass behind the first scene on their way out of the offices.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)

                         definitely not in my genetic make-
                         up...

               His POV STOPS, letting the Collection Agents go, on another 
               fellow, with the disreputable, cocksure demeanor of a private 
               dick, who is lolling near the water cooler, watching the 
               altercation with amusement. He is GREGORY, an IRS 
               INVESTIGATOR.

                         Whatever problems I was having were 
                         suddenly gone. I had no friends and 
                         I didn't talk to my family. The only 
                         constant, stabilizing force in my 
                         life was... drugs.

               MOVING POV as Mumford follows GREGORY down the gloomy alley 
               to a corner where they can spy at the scene beyond.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         I got teamed with one of the top 
                         guys, a fanatic named Gregory. He 
                         always got his man, whether they 
                         deserved it or not. He was a "closer" 
                         and everybody admired that...

               WHAT THEY SEE: The DRY CLEANING BOSS, a Middle-Eastern fellow, 
               is standing at the back door of his place paying his Asian 
               employees in cash as they leave.

                         He'd make the case and the Collection 
                         guys would come in and clean up. Our 
                         specialty was... sleazy skulking...

               Gregory turns to look at camera (Mumford) with a devilish 
               grin.

                         We were a good team. I was a dope

               MUMFORD'S POV as he supports a drunken Gregory as they stagger 
               down the sidewalk to a row house. Holding Gregory up on the 
               other side, is CANDY, Gregory's pretty wife. They wrangle 
               Gregory up the front steps. Gregory stumbles inside and 
               Mumford retreats down the steps, his eyes still on the front 
               door. Candy appears there and stares down at Mumford, who

               the room. She looks at camera, her face full of the pain of 
               leaving.

               EXT. FIRESCAPE/ROOF, BUILDING IN CITY - DAY

               MOVING POV as Mumford follows Gregory up the ladder and onto 
               the roof of this old building in a rundown industrial 
               neighborhood.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         The way the District Managers got 
                         ahead and won their bonuses was by 
                         generating maximum payments. That 
                         meant the revenue officers had to 
                         use all their "collection tools" -- 
                         seizures, liens, levies -- even if a 
                         more reasonable compromise could 
                         have been worked out. The best way 
                         to reduce resistance from the 
                         taxpayers was to build a convincing 
                         case -- whether there'd actually 
                         been a violation or not...

               Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof 
               and looks down on a building one block over. It is a small 
               furniture factory. Employees are eating their lunches on the 
               loading dock.

                         a particular sonuvabitch, and he 
                         knew just how to get Gregory crazy.

                         Gregory was acting more and more 
                         irrational. We started doing things 
                         that were over the line even for the 
                         IRS. When I look back on it now, I'm 
                         sure Gregory must have known about

               Mumford's POV slides into the passenger seat. Gregory is 
               already sitting in the driver's seat. He stares at Mumford a 
               long time.

               Mumford is following Gregory and REVENUE OFFICER MCLURE down

                         out right, Gregory and this Revenue 
                         Officer named McLure would put the

               Edmond Worrell, his wife, his adult SON and DAUGHTER, 
               WORRELL'S LAWYER, and, finally, the accountant Gorbeck are 
               ushered toward a conference room by McLure, Gregory and some 
               other IRS types. Gorbeck sneaks a nervous look at Mumford. 
               Gregory, who now appears slightly mad, motions for Mumford 
               to join them.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         The parties met repeatedly over a 
                         period of months. The IRS offered to 
                         settle for a sizable but, they said, 
                         fair amount. Worrell said he'd done 
                         nothing wrong and threatened to fight 
                         it all the way to Washington. He 
                         seemed pretty strong. I was secretly 
                         pulling for him. McLure and the 
                         District Manager stepped up the 
                         pressure.

                         What none of us down at the Service 
                         knew was that Edmond Worrell had a 
                         story too... Worrell's was that he'd 
                         been fighting chronic depression for 
                         thirty years. Under the heat of the 
                         investigation, he fell off his 
                         medication. One Tuesday morning, he 
                         went down to the factory early, wrote 
                         his family a letter, then used the 
                         9mm automatic they kept there to 
                         kill himself... The DM dropped the 
                         case that day and started proceedings 
                         to get rid of Gregory...

               The IMAGE HAS SLOWED TO A STILL. It now DISSOLVES TO:

               EXT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT

               Mumford's POV as he comes up the steps. The front door opens 
               before he gets there. Candy, her face bruised, her eyes red, 
               comes into view, she has a suitcase in hand.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         Gregory went home drunk, beat up 
                         Candy and went out to drink some 
                         more. Candy told me she didn't want 
                         to see me again. She hated us both 
                         and she was leaving us both... It 
                         made perfect sense to me. I felt the 
                         same way...

               INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Mumford is frantically, futilely looking for an imagined 
               drug stash. He's ransacked the place and is now throwing the 
               clothes out of a drawer.

               INT. BATHROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Mumford looks desperately through the pill bottles and 
               detritus in his squalid medicine cabinet.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         ...In fact, I was jealous of Candy. 
                         I wanted to leave too, just like 
                         her... get as far away from --

               Giving up, Mumford slams the medicine cabinet shut and FOR 
               THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS STORY BEGAN, WE SEE MUMFORD in his 
               previous incarnation. And this is probably as bad as he ever 
               looked. He stares at his image in the mirror.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         -- me... as possible.

               EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

               Skip is staring at Mumford. Empty beer bottles are lined up 
               on the porch railing.

                                     SKIP
                         And so you did...

               Mumford nods.

                         And the drugs?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Harder than I thought. Took me three 
                         tries. But I was highly motivated -- 
                         figured there was no point in leaving 
                         me and taking that along. After two 
                         bomb-outs, I found a place in the 
                         desert...

               INT. DESERT DRUG REHAB CENTER - SUNRISE

               A venetian blind is raised, revealing sunrise over a desert 
               landscape.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         The joint wasn't fancy -- it was run 
                         by an order of monks -- but it worked. 
                         When I got out of there, I was just 
                         about broke...

               EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mumford gets up from his chair and moves toward his door.

                                     MUMFORD
                         ...which seemed perfect for starting 
                         something new. Be back.

               Mumford goes inside. Skip sits listening to the night. From 
               downstairs, in Lily's apartment, he HEARS A SHOWER GO ON. 
               Mumford comes back out.

                                     SKIP
                         Somebody's taking a shower down there.

                         I'd take five a day if I had the 
                         time. I went to this spa in Germany, 
                         a sanitarium practically, up on this 
                         mountain. And the great thing -- 
                         they just kept you wet all day.

                         deal at your local Kinko's. The only 
                         variable is how much pride you take 
                         in the product.

               INT. ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY

               ON A COMPUTER SCREEN an elaborate graphics program is creating 
               the filigreed border of a birth certificate that already 
               bears the official-looking designs of "Green County, State 
               of West Virginia".

                         With desktop publishing, you don't 
                         have to deal with printers, supply 
                         houses, or pesky government agencies. 
                         Eventually you do have to get your 
                         hands on a typewriter. Ever seen one 
                         of those, Skip?

               As the border is completed, we PUSH IN and DISSOLVE THROUGH 
               TO:

               SURFACE OF A DESK, with an electric Smith-Corona typewriter 
               (late '50's vintage). EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the keys hammering 
               out individual letters and numbers: date, hospital, attending 
               physician.

                         Is that like a mimeograph?... What 
                         about the name?

               EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mumford looks at Skip.

                         What about it?

                         "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the

                                     MUMFORD
                         Oh. You got it backwards. I already 
                         had the name when I started looking 
                         for somewhere to settle. When I saw 
                         this town on a map, I thought maybe 
                         it was a sign. See...

               INT. ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY

               The typewriter is just pounding out: MICHAEL OLIVER MUM-F-O-
               R-D.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         ...Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's 
                         kindergarten class with me. He was 
                         killed with his parents in a wreck 
                         on their way back from a Steelers 
                         game. He was only six years old, 
                         which is a real plus, so there's a 
                         birth certificate if anyone checks -- 
                         but not much else. They died in 
                         Pennsylvania, so there's no death 
                         certificate in West Virginia... that's 
                         also good.

               ON A KITCHEN TABLE, the new birth certificate, now filled 
               out for Michael Mumford, is carefully lifted from a shallow 
               bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby). The paper has 
               taken on an aged, sepia look. CUT TO:

               A STACK OF BOOKS. The ones on top are lifted away. The bottom 
               book is opened to reveal the birth certificate. It has been 
               folded in an official way. Now Mumford unfolds it, then 
               refolds it differently -- with its smudges and creases, it's 
               starting to look old.

                                     SKIP (V.O.)
                         And a birth certificate is enough?

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         Everything flows from that, and what 
                         doesn't... can be easily purchased.

               SERIES OF SHOTS of Mumford's DOCUMENTATION PILING UP. A post 
               office box is emptied, official-looking correspondence is 
               opened, the bounty is laid out for perusal: Social Security 
               card, driver's license, college and graduate school diplomas, 
               license and accreditation to operate as a therapist.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - SUNRISE

               Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first 
               light. Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around 
               his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand, 
               then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with 
               varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity is 
               tiring for her, but she's committed.

                                     SOFIE
                         ...so we get on this incredible steam 
                         engine train that runs up into the 
                         mountains...
                              (she tosses a paper, 
                              grunting)
                         ...and this trip is everything it's 
                         cracked up to be... an open car, 
                         great views, the mountain air blowing 
                         through. We're sitting there, married 
                         for six years, and he says how he 
                         likes it better when I put my hair 
                         back...

               Mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all 
               her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. Mumford, 
               who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first.

                                     SOFIE
                         That wasn't so good.

               Mumford snaps out of it. He goes up on the lawn and flips 
               the paper deftly onto the porch. As they continue --

                         the whole way.

                         It doesn't matter. Go on.

                                     SOFIE
                         Oh... this makes me sound irrational, 
                         which is probably right, but there 
                         was something about him saying this -- 
                         it was maybe the millionth time he'd 
                         told me about some preference of 
                         his. Well, I was so... tired of it.
                              (memories)
                         Seems like my whole life someone's 
                         been telling me... I'm just not 
                         getting it right. Can we rest for a 
                         second?

               She leans against the iron handrail on some front steps, 
               breathing hard.

                                     SOFIE
                         You're purposely making me talk while 
                         we do this...
                              (Mumford nods)
                         ...because you think this is good 
                         for me...
                              (nods again)
                         ...and you're a sadistic bastard...

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yes.

                                     SOFIE
                         ...who thinks there's nothing really 
                         wrong with me.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Oh, there's something wrong with 
                         you, all right. Especially after 
                         hearing that dream of yours, about 
                         the Roto-Rooter.

               She laughs. They're playing with each other.

                                     SOFIE
                         That was really bad, wasn't it?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Disgusting.

                                     SOFIE
                         And I'll bet you can interpret the 
                         whole thing

                                     MUMFORD
                         It's pretty obvious to a trained 
                         professional.

               Sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from 
               his sack. He points to the next house.

                                     SOFIE
                         I hate those dreams where everything 
                         means something.

               Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch. She turns to 
               him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her, 
               she glances away, uncomfortable.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Is that when you split up?

                                     SOFIE
                         No, that'd be a good story, but that 
                         was just the beginning of the end. 
                         We went on for another year or so.

               Mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house.

                                     SOFIE
                         So whose route is this?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. 
                         Lives next door.

                                     SOFIE
                         And he's where?

                                     MUMFORD
                         In the capitol for Boy's Nation. 
                         Five days. Why?

                                     SOFIE
                              (heaves another paper)
                         I'm thinking a gal could make a good 
                         living doing this. How hard could it 
                         be squeezing out some fourteen year 
                         old?

                                     MUMFORD
                         You like it?

                                     SOFIE
                         It's all right.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Then you can expect me at 5:30 
                         tomorrow morning.

                                     SOFIE
                         And this is legitimate therapy?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want 
                         to do it alone.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               TIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick, glossy magazine 
               pages: each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED 
               SNAP of the page being turned, like a gunshot. We're SO CLOSE 
               to the images we can't tell when the magazines change -- 
               from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to W to Vanity 
               Fair. And it doesn't matter. Whether the images are ads or 
               fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same -- 
               jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff 
               or anorexic, but always severely beautiful. The PAGE TURNING 
               starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense. 
               Finally --

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         What is it, Nessa?

               The IMAGES CONTINUE.

                                     NESSA (V.O.)
                         Isn't she amazing? That is such a 
                         wicked look.

                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)
                         What do you want me to see?

                                     NESSA (V.O.)
                         Just chill for a second. Look at 
                         this guy, it appears he's actually 
                         dead... but gorgeous.

               Mumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch. At their feet 
               is a mess of magazines. Nessa discards one and immediately 
               starts flipping through a new one beneath it. She is very 
               agitated. Mumford stands up, walks over and sits in his chair.

                                     NESSA
                         What are you doing? We're not done. 
                         I just need to find the thing...

                                     MUMFORD
                         If you don't want to have a session 
                         today, it's okay.

                                     NESSA
                         I want to have the session. I thought 
                         it would be cool if I could show you 
                         some of the things that interest me. 
                         But I guess you're not into it... 
                         which we already knew.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What happened today?

                                     NESSA
                         What are you talking about?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Was it something that happened at 
                         school?

                                     NESSA
                              (petulant)
                         These appointments were not my idea, 
                         remember.

                                     MUMFORD
                         True. Should we stop them?

               A look of panic crosses Nessa's face, but she instantly hides 
               it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't 
               use. Instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed 
               magazine on her chest.

                                     NESSA
                         I don't think you know what you're 
                         talking about.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Uh-huh.

                                     NESSA
                         This shrink school you went to... 
                         did you hear about it on an 
                         infomercial?

               Mumford waits. Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin.

                                     NESSA
                         I want to live in the world these 
                         people are in. No one ever says 
                         anything in there, have you noticed? 
                         So they're very cool. Like they're 
                         all really deep. It's when people 
                         start talking that everything goes 
                         to shit.

               Nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears, but beats it back.

                                     NESSA
                         There's this kid at school... Martin 
                         Brockett. He has some gigantic idea 
                         of himself that no one else shares. 
                         You wouldn't believe the crap he 
                         lays on me... Who appointed him my 
                         spiritual leader? If he has everything 
                         so figured out how come his best 
                         friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he 
                         spend all his time chasing after me? 
                         Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a 
                         hummer...

                                     MUMFORD
                         Do you think that's what he wants?

                                     NESSA
                              (after a beat)
                         No. I don't know what he wants. But 
                         I know I don't like being watched. 
                         Nobody's ever paid any attention to 
                         what I did, and I liked it just fine. 
                         Where does he get off telling me I 
                         disrespect myself?
                              (a beat)
                         Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.

               EXT. LILY'S CAFÉ, MAIN STREET - DAY

               Mumford crosses the street from his office. A huge bus with 
               "APPLEJACK TOURS" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers, 
               a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN, all of whom file 
               neatly into Lily's Café. Lily stands on the sidewalk outside 
               greeting them merrily.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What's the deal?

               Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered 
               sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch. See you 
               tomorrow."

                                     LILY
                         They come through a few times each 
                         year.
                              (greeting one cheerily)
                         Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you 
                         again!
                              (back to Mumford)
                         It's a tour.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Where am I supposed to eat?

                                     LILY
                         You're on your own today, honey.

               Mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across 
               the street. He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment, 
               then back out there.

               WHAT HE SEES: Skip is once again zipping down the street on 
               his skateboard in the midst of traffic. He has not noticed 
               Mumford.

                                     MUMFORD (O.S.)
                         Hey, Skip!

               Skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, 
               barely checking the surrounding traffic. He is extraordinarily 
               skillful. When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board-
               flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk. 
               Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight.

                                     SKIP
                         Doc.

               Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately 
               distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited 
               to meet the local celebrity.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, 
                         Lily.

                                     LILY
                         It's a pleasure to meet you.

                                     SKIP
                              (flustered)
                         Yeah... me you, too... I was at your 
                         house...

                                     LILY
                         Oh?

                         Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's 
                         very nice... I heard your shower.

               Skip can't believe what he just said. Neither can the other 
               two, actually. Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but 
               he cuts it off fast. Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has 
               charmed her. Something's happening here.

                         I've seen you going by on your board, 
                         but I didn't realize -- you're so 
                         young... to be so...

                         you, I'm very immature.

               He's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. They're 
               all relieved. Then there's an awkward silence. Skip watches 
               the last of the tour enter the restaurant.

                         It's okay. They pre-order. There's a

                         Well, come on in.

               She motions him in and starts to follow. Mumford makes a 
               "what about me?" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the 
               sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk.

                         Dr. Mumford.

               Mumford turns to find Dr. Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler, the 
               shrinks Lionel had conferred with, standing nearby. It takes 
               a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco. Finally, shaking 
               hands --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you 
                         again.

                                     DELBANCO
                         I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. 
                         She's the other therapist here in 
                         town.

                              (shaking her hand)
                         Of course... I've heard great things 
                         about you.

                                     SHEELER
                         Thank you.

                                     DELBANCO
                         You never got back to me.
                              (Mumford doesn't 
                              understand)
                         ...I called to say we'd like to take 
                         you out for a meal?... Kind of a 
                         professional welcome.

               Mumford makes a show of remembering.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Forgive me, please. What a gracious 
                         thought. We must do that.

                                     SHEELER
                         When?

                         my calendar in front of me?

                                     DELBANCO
                         What are you doing for lunch?

                         Right now?

               The other two nod in unison. Mumford considers, trapped.

               INT. THE LANTERN AND THE LAMB RESTAURANT - DAY

               The town's upscale dining spot. Mumford, Delbanco and Sheeler 
               are in a red leather booth. Sheeler listens with rapt, 
               admiring attention as Delbanco speaks --

                                     DELBANCO
                         ...annihilation anxieties engendered 
                         by bad experiences with a depriving 
                         mother... but no one can escape the 
                         fear of death. It is, as Henry James 
                         put it, "the worm at the core." Try 
                         as we may to forget or ignore our 
                         mortality, James said --
                              (theatrically)
                         -- "the skull will grin in at the 
                         banquet."

               Mumford nods appreciatively. (He really is an extraordinary 
               listener.) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's 
               adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious --

                                     DELBANCO
                         I've run on. Forgive me. We're here 
                         to talk about you.

                         What Ernest means, I think, is we're 
                         very interested in other 
                         methodology... different kinds of 
                         training. We're great believers in 
                         learning from each other. I've learned 
                         so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...

                         My mentor was an amazing teacher 
                         named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite 
                         tragically in the collapse of a 
                         gazebo.

                                     DELBANCO
                         I think I've heard of him... a 
                         disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?

               Mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant.

                                     MUMFORD
                         It's possible. I don't know about 
                         that.

                                     SHEELER
                         I suppose your extended training was 
                         at an institution in that area?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Lots of institutions. My graduate 
                         advisor believed we should experience 
                         as many environments as possible -- 
                         prisons, clinics, half-way houses. 
                         For a while I was chief therapist in 
                         a shopping mall. Had a little spot 
                         next to the yogurt place.

                                     DELBANCO
                         Interesting approach. What was his 
                         name?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She 
                         passed last year in a train wreck. 
                         Damned Amtrak.

               Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look. Sheeler adopts a 
               "casual" tone --

                                     SHEELER
                         I trained in the east, myself -- 
                         Cornell -- and I don't care what 
                         anyone says, there really are regional 
                         differences. I found the state 
                         certification exams out here quite 
                         harrowing... Did you?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess 
                         that's good... to keep out the quacks.

                                     SHEELER
                         Which examiner did you have? I 
                         probably know him.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.

               A dark look comes over Sheeler's face for a moment.

                                     SHEELER
                         That was a terrible thing.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (agrees)
                         I don't even know why hang-gliding 
                         is considered a legitimate sport.

                                     DELBANCO
                              (back on track)
                         We're interested in any new therapies. 
                         How would you characterize your 
                         approach?

                                     MUMFORD
                         My approach?

                                     SHEELER
                         Yes... your particular approach.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I don't have one really. Most of the 
                         time I'm faking it. See, I think 
                         there's not much that can be done 
                         about most problems... they're too 
                         complicated, too deep-rooted by the 
                         time I hear about them. The most I 
                         can do, usually, is look and listen 
                         real closely, try to catch some 
                         glimpse of the secret life everybody's 
                         got. If I can get a sense of that, 
                         well then, maybe... just maybe, I 
                         can help them out a little.

               Mumford sits back, considering the couple across the table. 
               His gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become 
               uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other. Finally --

                         I see.

                                     ALTHEA
                         It's irrelevant. It had nothing to 
                         do with what happened.

                                     MUMFORD (O.S.)
                         What happened?

               Althea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford. She has a 
               bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her -- the 
               only sign that she's not completely calm.

                                     ALTHEA
                         We argued on Sunday. He went to work 
                         on Monday and stayed in the city 
                         during the week, like always. But on 
                         Thursday, when he normally comes 
                         home, he didn't. Didn't call either. 
                         Not till Saturday afternoon.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You must have been concerned.

                                     ALTHEA
                         It's happened before.
                              (a beat)
                         I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. 
                         I can't understand it.
                              (a real question --)
                         I'll probably have a complete 
                         depressoid collapse soon, won't I?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Doubtful. What did he say?

                                     ALTHEA
                         He said he wasn't coming back. He 
                         said it wasn't working for him any 
                         more. That it hadn't "worked for 
                         him" for quite a while... You know 
                         what I regret the most? I'm sorry I 
                         let him make the kids take his name. 
                         He was an acquirer.
                              (off Mumford's look)
                         He liked to acquire things.

               Mumford looks away. Althea realizes what he's thinking.

                                     ALTHEA
                         You think that has something to do 
                         with my problem? Ordering all those 
                         things?...

               It hadn't occurred to Mumford, but it's an interesting 
               thought.

                                     ALTHEA
                         ...Like I was on some kind of campaign 
                         to out-acquire him...
                              (excited now, playing 
                              it out)
                         ...If I was just an acquisition to 
                         him, and he lost interest once he 
                         had me --

               She stops, shakes her head.

                                     ALTHEA
                         That can't be it. It's too simple. 
                         And besides, I still like it. This 
                         morning I ordered a marble turtle 
                         cheese board from The Horchow 
                         Collection.
                              (an odd look)
                         Can I tell you something just awful? 
                         You know how people who are just 
                         assholes will sometimes look at a 
                         woman who's got problems and say, 
                         "What she needs is a good shtupping!"?

               Mumford nods.

                                     ALTHEA
                         Well, there may be something to that. 
                         Jeremy didn't keep up his end -- Oh, 
                         what difference does it make?
                              (suddenly)
                         Why do I feel elated? Am I in denial? 
                         You know what it feels like?...

               She glances at her watch, then starts talking fast --

                                     ALTHEA
                         I know my time's up, but I've got to 
                         get this out while I've got hold of 
                         it --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Take your time.

                                     ALTHEA
                              (no slowing down)
                         -- When I was in high school, the 
                         thing I wanted most, when I was stuck 
                         in class, the thing I was always 
                         desperately in pursuit of -- was a 
                         hall pass. That's all I wanted. I 
                         loved moving freely around the school 
                         while everybody else was trapped in 
                         there... And that's how I feel right 
                         now... Like I have some giant, all-
                         day hall pass.

               She is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious. She 
               stands up abruptly, flushed.

                                     ALTHEA
                         My god, did it just get hot in here 
                         or what?

               She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her 
               purse. She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up 
               the front and hugs her body. WE SEE for the first time what 
               all her other outfits have hidden: Althea has a terrific, 
               voluptuous figure.

                                     ALTHEA
                         See you next time. I'll probably be 
                         a basket case by then.

               She heads toward the door to the waiting room. Mumford 
               indicates the back door.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You can go out there if you like...

                                     ALTHEA
                              (quoting Mumford)
                         "There's no shame in getting a little 
                         therapy", right, Doc?

               She opens the door to the waiting room, startling Henry 
               Follett, who jumps up from a chair out there, magazine still 
               in hand.

               INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Follett is embarrassed to be discovered here. But that's 
               secondary to the impact Althea's current appearance -- sexy 
               body framed in the doorway -- is having on him. She's been a 
               customer in his store, but he's seeing her now as if for the 
               first time. All his libidinous buttons are being pushed. 
               Althea breezes by, oblivious to his reaction.

                                     ALTHEA
                         Hello, Mr. Follett. Have a good 
                         session. Bye, Doc.

               She goes out.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Henry...

               But Follett continues to stare in the direction Althea has 
               gone.

               INT. LOBBY ATRIUM, PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Mumford is being escorted across the spectacular atrium by a 
               PANDA SECURITY AIDE. Her informal uniform, and all the other 
               details in the building, carry out the Panda design motif. 
               As they head down the main corridor --

                                     SKIP (O.S.)
                         Hey, Doc!

               Mumford looks that way. In the distance, Skip is descending 
               from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of 
               ramps designed for that purpose alone. None of the hustling 
               Panda Employees in the area take any particular notice of 
               the sight.

               Skip meets Mumford and his escort at the bottom of the ramp 
               with a spectacular stop.

                                     SKIP
                         Thanks, Jennifer, I'll take him from 
                         here.

               The Security Aide retreats as Skip (riding slowly alongside) 
               leads Mumford into a side corridor.

               INT. BOWELS OF THE BUILDING, PANDA MODEM HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               SERIES OF SHOTS. Skip and Mumford move through a maze of 
               hallways with progressively less foot traffic.

                                     SKIP
                         I've never brought anyone down here 
                         before.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'm honored.

                                     SKIP
                         Doc, there's something about what 
                         you told me the other night I can't 
                         get out of my head. It's driving me 
                         batty --
                              (Mumford nods, waits)
                         Why me? How did you know you could 
                         trust me?

                                     MUMFORD
                         You're completely reliable.

               Skip is pleased. They approach a heavy steel door, the 
               entrance to Skip's Workshop. A VERY OLD SECURITY AIDE sits 
               at the end of the intersecting hallway, watching this area. 
               Skip shouts down there --

                                     SKIP
                         It's just me, Dino!

               The old man nods, barely awake.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Skip, I've got a problem and I need 
                         some advice.

                                     SKIP
                         You want my advice? Far out!

               Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall. Some 
               lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches. 
               Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door. He 
               hesitates, suddenly concerned --

                                     SKIP
                         I hope nothing you're about to see 
                         will shake your faith in me.

               Mumford reassures him with a look. Skip pushes the door open 
               far enough for them to enter, then pulls it closed behind 
               them.

               INT. SKIP'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               Mumford and Skip enter the large, windowless workspace. What 
               at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized. 
               Many different disciplines interface here:

               THE BODY SECTION: The first thing one notices -- some 
               incredibly life-like, anatomically correct, 
               sculpture/mannequins -- both male and female. You half expect 
               them to breathe. From there, a full wall of forms descends 
               from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a 
               huge variety of inflatable sex dolls.

               THE CYBER SECTION: A dizzying array of computers and screens, 
               some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated 
               motion. Above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of computer 
               generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs.

               THE BODY PARTS SECTION: Medical models of teeth, eyes, lips, 
               limbs. Hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, rubber 
               vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia.

               THE FORM-CASTING SHOP: All the machinery you need to make 
               rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer 
               designed.

               All these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, high-
               tech work surfaces. Skip watches Mumford move about in awe, 
               picking up the odd item.

                                     SKIP
                         Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally 
                         disgusted?

                                     MUMFORD
                              ("no")
                         Skip, you're a visionary. That can 
                         be a burden.

                                     SKIP
                         This doesn't seem a little... 
                         perverse?

                                     MUMFORD
                         There are a lot of lonely people in 
                         the world. Somebody's gonna figure 
                         this out someday.

                                     SKIP
                         It's not going to be me. I'm giving 
                         it up.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Really?

                                     SKIP
                         It's all your fault. In the last 48 
                         hours, I've completely lost interest.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What'd I do?

               Skip looks at Mumford, a wide grin on his face.

                                     SKIP
                         Lily.

                         Lily...
                              (gets it)
                         ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.

                         Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. 
                         Right now, of the two of us, I'm the 
                         only one in love. But I'm very stoked.

               Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by 
               an array of limbs and sex toys. There's an assembled pelvic 
               section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him.

                                     SKIP
                         Doc, how I can be of help to you?

               Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a 
               button. The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and 
               sensually, in place. It's amazingly life-like, but it makes 
               a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND. Skip fumbles to turn it off.

                                     SKIP
                         Sorry...

                                     MUMFORD
                         Wow.

               Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford.

                                     SKIP
                         I'm here for you, Doc.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Skip, you know that it's improper -- 
                         completely unethical -- for a licensed 
                         psychologist to carry on a romantic 
                         relationship with one of his patients?

                                     SKIP
                         I guess that makes sense.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yes, yes it does...

               Mumford sinks into silence. He begins to wander the room.

                                     SKIP
                         You've fallen in love with one of 
                         your patients?

               Mumford nods. Skip is desperate to say something useful. 
               Suddenly, he has an alarming thought.

                                     SKIP
                         Doc!... It's not me, is it?

                                     MUMFORD
                         What?

               Mumford understands and can't stop a laugh.

                                     MUMFORD
                         No, Skip, it's not you. But I like 
                         you a lot.

               Skip is relieved. He has another thought and brightens.

                                     SKIP
                         Doc, what about this? You're not 
                         really a licensed psychologist!

               Mumford turns to meet Skip's gaze. Skip realizes the 
               ramifications of what he's just said.

                                     SKIP
                         Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I 
                         see where you're going here. It's a 
                         mess.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yep.

               INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Lionel is here with Delbanco and Sheeler. This time, Delbanco 
               is behind his desk, Sheeler across the room on the sofa.

                                     LIONEL
                         Don't you find it incredibly 
                         convenient that everyone who could 
                         possibly corroborate his story has 
                         recently died some exotic death?

                                     DELBANCO
                         They're neither all recent nor exotic.

                                     SHEELER
                         But they're certainly dead. And yes, 
                         personally, I find it a bit odd.

                                     DELBANCO
                         It could happen. What about his state 
                         certification exams? The records 
                         seem to be in order.

               Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear.

                                     LIONEL
                         What's easier than hacking your way 
                         into a state computer and inserting 
                         some numbers? For all you know he 
                         never even took the exams!

                                     SHEELER
                         That's true.

                                     DELBANCO
                         I don't know that it's all that 
                         easy...

                                     LIONEL
                         Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but 
                         it sounds to me like you've gone for 
                         this guy's story hook, line and bull-
                         twaddle.

                                     SHEELER
                         You do seem much more disposed toward 
                         him than I understand, Ernest. Did I 
                         miss something?

                                     DELBANCO
                              (sharply)
                         Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we 
                         have no reason to doubt the man! Are 
                         we listening to Lionel now?

               Sheeler jumps, so shocked is she by his outburst, and so 
               humiliated for Lionel to witness it. Fighting tears and trying 
               to maintain her dignity, she gathers up her things and walks 
               to the door. Delbanco, immediately contrite, stands up.

                                     DELBANCO
                         Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 
                         shout...

                                     SHEELER
                         No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am 
                         sorry. Sorry to have wasted your 
                         time with such...

               She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office. Delbanco 
               is left facing Lionel, who gives him exactly the look the 
               doctor least wants to see.

               INT. LILY'S CAFÉ - DAY

               Mumford is eating his lunch at the counter. He watches Lily 
               busily working the midday rush. She sees him grinning at 
               her, but doesn't say anything for a while. Finally, blushing --

                                     LILY
                         Stop it! He's a kid. I'm old enough 
                         to be his... older sister.

               Mumford smiles, eats.

               INT. ENTRY HALL, COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mr. Cook opens the front door to Mumford.

                                     COOK
                         Dr. Mumford. Please, come in.

               Mumford comes in, reluctantly.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if 
                         Sofie was around?

                                     COOK
                         Were you supposed to have a session?

                                     MUMFORD
                         No. It's sort of spur of the moment.

               INT. LIVING ROOM, COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mumford follows Mr. Cook into the room. Mrs. Cook and Sofie's 
               thirtyish brother, BEN, are in there, watching television. 
               Mrs. Cook keeps knitting; Ben stands to shake Mumford's hand, 
               muting the TV with a remote.

                                     COOK
                         Look who's here. Have you met Sofie's 
                         moth--

                                     MRS. COOK
                         -- We've met.

                                     COOK
                         And our son, Ben...

                                     BEN
                              (vigorously shakes 
                              hands)
                         This is a real honor, Doctor. Have a 
                         seat, will ya?

               Mumford continues to stand.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Well, actually, I can't really... Do 
                         you think I could see Sofie?

                                     BEN
                         I insist! I've been wanting to meet 
                         you.

               Mumford sits.

                                     MRS. COOK
                              (icy)
                         Sofie's not here.

               Mumford's surprised. Mr. Cook speaks with some pleasure.

                                     COOK
                         Her friend from the city came and 
                         took her out to dinner. First time 
                         in a long time she's been willing.

                                     MUMFORD
                         A friend?

                                     BEN
                         We owe that to you. She's perked up 
                         a lot since you started treating 
                         her.

               Mrs. Cook gives Ben a condescending look and keeps knitting.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         What'd you want?

                                     MUMFORD
                         There's something I think we need to 
                         talk about.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         What?

                                     MR. COOK
                         Elizabeth...

                                     MRS. COOK
                         I think we have a right.

                                     BEN
                         We certainly do not.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Keep it zipped, Ben.

               Ben gives Mumford an exasperated look, but doesn't argue.

                                     MR. COOK
                         Is there something we need to know, 
                         Dr. Mumford?

               Mumford is conflicted, not sure what to share with them.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Well... yes, I guess I should tell 
                         you. I don't think I'm going to be 
                         able to treat Sofie anymore.

               Mr. Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance. Mrs. Cook 
               actually cheers up.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Finally, some common sense...

                                     MUMFORD
                         What do you mean?

                                     MRS. COOK
                         I think you know what I mean.

                                     MUMFORD
                         No, I really don't.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         I think you do.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Why don't you tell me?

                                     MRS. COOK
                              (very calm)
                         Why don't you go to hell? It's all a 
                         bunch of nonsense and you know it.

                                     MR. COOK
                         Elizabeth, I'm tellin' you, stop 
                         this...

                                     MRS. COOK
                              (dismissive)
                         You're telling me? That's rich...

                                     MUMFORD
                              (standing up)
                         I'd better go.

                                     BEN
                         Why can't you see Sofie? I know the 
                         treatment's working.

               Mumford looks from Ben to Mr. Cook, who nods his agreement.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Well... you see, the problem is --

                                     MRS. COOK
                         -- the problem is you're a big fake. 
                         You haven't got a clue what's wrong 
                         with that girl.

               Mumford looks at Mrs. Cook and can't stifle a laugh.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Wow. You're something.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Take a hike, Dr. Quack!

                                     MR. COOK
                              (ignoring her now)
                         What is the problem, Doctor?

               Mumford can't take his eyes off Mrs. Cook, even as he speaks 
               to Mr. Cook.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Problem? I guess there is no 
                         problem... Uh, this friend of Sofie's, 
                         where'd he take her?

                                     BEN
                         It's she -- Roxy. Used to work with 
                         her. I think they went over to The 
                         Lantern.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (delighted)
                         Oh, Roxy! Excellent. Roxy.

               Mrs. Cook looks at him sharply. She's heard what the other 
               two have not.

               EXT. SIDE STREET/ALLEY - DAY

               Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and 
               into an alley. As he passes a secluded space created by two 
               adjacent buildings, something catches his eye.

               MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking 
               intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa 
               and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign. 
               Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the 
               view is interrupted by a wall.

               Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.

               EXT. BACK DOOR, FOLLETT'S PHARMACY - DAY

               There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to 
               the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open. 
               When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on 
               the metal screen.

               INT. HENRY FOLLETT'S OFFICE - DAY

               Follett's private space is above and at the back of his 
               drugstore. When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as 
               Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the 
               store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror.

               The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened.

                                     FOLLETT
                         What is it?

                                     MUMFORD
                         It's a thought I had.

                                     FOLLETT
                         Should I open it now?

               Mumford seems hesitant, but nods. Follett takes out an Exacto 
               knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go 
               on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Let me just say something here... I 
                         have no idea if this is going to 
                         help.

                                     FOLLETT
                         What exactly is it supposed to do?

                                     MUMFORD
                         You remember when I asked you about 
                         pornography --

                                     FOLLETT
                         -- I find it degrading. Maximum 
                         gynecology and minimum turn-on --

                                     MUMFORD
                         -- and you told me that. Still, 
                         there's some kind of imagery that's 
                         haunting you and, I think, getting 
                         in your way --

                                     FOLLETT
                         -- Which I don't necessarily agree.

                                     MUMFORD
                         But you did come to me.

               Follett reacts. It's true, even if he keeps forgetting.

                                     MUMFORD
                         My guess is these images were burned 
                         into your brain when you were young. 
                         Maybe if we could nail down the exact 
                         fantasies that are haunting you -- 
                         maybe you could get past them... 
                         Anyway, I thought we could try an 
                         experiment.

                                     FOLLETT
                              (indicating the box)
                         And the experiment is in here?

               Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You know what? I think this was a 
                         dumb idea...

               He starts to take hold of the box.

                                     MUMFORD
                         ...I just heard myself talking and I 
                         realize I'm completely unqualified 
                         to be doing this. Let's forget the 
                         whole thing.

               Follett grabs the box back.

                                     FOLLETT
                         Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I 
                         want to know what's in here.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (pulling on the box)
                         There's absolutely no reason to think 
                         this is going to have any impact on 
                         you. I'm embarrassed to have --

               Follett stands up and grabs the box, taking sole possession. 
               Loud --

                                     FOLLETT
                         Hey! I agree with you that you don't 
                         know what you're talking about. That's 
                         what I've been saying all along. And 
                         I can guarantee you that looking at 
                         the Lost Ark or whatever you got in 
                         here is not going to mean diddly to 
                         me...
                              (quieting down)
                         ...but if you think I'm going to let 
                         you walk out of here without seeing 
                         what's in this box, you don't know 
                         much about Henry A. Follett.

               Mumford gives up. Follett gestures to ask whether it's safe 
               to put the box on the desk; Mumford reassures him. Now, with 
               much more anticipation and ceremony than before, Follett 
               carefully cuts open the package.

               THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the 
               flaps. There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which 
               has been set a low-rent catalogue: "METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES -- 
               Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia." Follett lifts away 
               the wrapping --

               There are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fifties 
               and early sixties: Nugget, Adam, The Adam Reader, Swank, 
               Dude. Plus several cartoon collections: Sex to Sexty, Stag 
               Humor. Plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocative 
               illustrations on the covers: Night Call Nurse, The Neighbors 
               Have No Curtains, Secretarial Sluts, etc. Finally, two video 
               tapes, both of Russ Meyer films: MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW 
               CABIN.

               We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Follett's hands 
               shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages. Very 
               soft-core by today's standards, the common thread is clear: 
               voluptuous, heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out 
               of them) tempting muscular, he-man drifters or libidinous 
               businessmen. A world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitters, 
               and frustrated, neglected wives. In other words, exactly the 
               erotic ambience of Follett's fantasies.

               SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT'S FACE. He is transported, mesmerized, 
               galvanized. In fact, at this moment, as the MUSIC SWELLS, a 
               tear is rolling down his cheek. He dare not take his eyes 
               from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford. The only thing 
               that could wreck his mood now, is --

                                     YOUNG PHARMACIST (O.S.)
                         Mr. Follett --

               Follett jumps, startled from his revery. As the Young 
               Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams 
               everything back into the box as best he can and tries to 
               cover it.

                                     FOLLETT
                         What?! What the hell is so important 
                         I can't have five minutes --?

               The Young Pharmacist is cowed and doesn't advance into the 
               room.

                                     YOUNG PHARMACIST
                         It's her, sir. You told me to get 
                         you when she came to pick up her 
                         prescription.

               It takes Follett a moment to understand, but when he does, 
               his whole manner changes. He dismisses the Young Pharmacist 
               with a nod, then gives a quick, self-conscious glance to 
               Mumford.

                                     FOLLETT
                         Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...
                              (indicates box)
                         ...I really appreciate what you're 
                         trying to... uh, I can't thank you 
                         enough for...

                                     MUMFORD
                         My pleasure.

               Follett heads for the door, pausing briefly at a mirror to 
               check his appearance, pushing at his hair with his palm.

                                     FOLLETT
                         I'll see you on... whatever...

               He hurries out. Mumford stands up to leave, but first looks 
               down through the one-way mirror.

               WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription 
               counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she 
               looks quite sexy. Follett brings her prescription up and 
               begins playfully flirting. Althea is responsive. Follett 
               motions Althea down the aisle, where it's more private. He 
               comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show Althea 
               something on the prescription bottle. Althea leans back 
               against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in 
               Follett's first fantasy.

               Mumford reacts, bemused.

               EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY

               Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite 
               her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous 
               progress since we first saw her.

                                     SOFIE
                         When I was in high school we used to 
                         come up here and make out. I liked 
                         to sit on the rock and watch the sun 
                         go down.

                                     MUMFORD
                         That's what I like.

                                     SOFIE
                         Which thing?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Either one.

                                     SOFIE
                         Why'd you come to the house the other 
                         night?

                                     MUMFORD
                         I thought I had something to tell 
                         you. But it turned out I didn't.

                                     SOFIE
                         My brother said you were about to 
                         fire me.

                                     MUMFORD
                         That's one way to put it.

                                     SOFIE
                         I bet I know what changed your mind...
                              (Mumford looks at her)
                         ...My mother. She was so horrible, 
                         you decided you couldn't desert me.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I thought only action movies had 
                         villains like that.

               Sofie gestures ahead.

                                     SOFIE
                         That's the cut-off, isn't it?
                              (Mumford nods)
                         I know why you were going to quit 
                         seeing me.

               Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the 
               woods.

               EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY

               Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she 
               steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of 
               her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle 
               herself.

                                     SOFIE
                         You feel like a fake, an imposter...

               Mumford looks up, sharply.

                                     SOFIE
                         ...as if maybe you don't know what 
                         you're doing.

               She puts a hand on his arm.

                                     SOFIE
                         Everybody feels that way sometimes... 
                         like we're not who we're supposed to 
                         be. But I have to tell you, Dr. 
                         Mumford --

               He winces at her formality.

                                     SOFIE
                         -- you've been a tremendous help to 
                         me.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yeah?

                                     SOFIE
                         I can't tell you how much I admire 
                         you. You have a wonderful way with 
                         people. And you're very insightful. 
                         I feel like you've seen me clearly... 
                         I never used to admit what a horrible 
                         person my mother was. You've made 
                         that possible for me.

                                     MUMFORD
                         That's... good?

                                     SOFIE
                         Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never 
                         accepted me for who I was, just like 
                         Mother. The things you've said have 
                         helped me understand what a dick he 
                         is.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I don't know if --

                                     SOFIE
                         You're shockingly honest, that's 
                         what makes you great. I've never had 
                         a man treat me this way. With you, I 
                         feel really... listened to.
                              (gives him a look)
                         Can I tell you something? It's a 
                         little embarrassing, but I feel very 
                         unguarded with you.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Of course.

                                     SOFIE
                         Thanks to this therapy, I now know 
                         what I'm looking for. I need to find 
                         a man like you.
                              (laughs)
                         Not one who's treating me, of course.
                              (full of resolve)
                         And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've 
                         given me the confidence.

               Mumford is in agony.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sofie... that makes me very happy.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Nessa's on the couch, playing with her usual unlit cigarette. 
               There's an uncharacteristic lightness to her.

                                     NESSA
                         ...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously 
                         deluded. I said that to him, I said, 
                         "If you think I'm gonna do all that 
                         shit for you, man, you are seriously 
                         deluded."

                                     MUMFORD
                         What'd he say?

                                     NESSA
                              (can't hide her 
                              pleasure)
                         He said -- "Which we already knew!"

               Mumford laughs, delighted.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What did he want you to do?

                                     NESSA
                         First off, he tells me to stop smoking 
                         cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'-
                         lutely no. As you can see --

               She holds up the cigarette as though it were her middle 
               finger, flipping the bird.

                                     NESSA
                         Then he says stop smoking dope. No 
                         again. So then he says he doesn't 
                         want me getting together with any 
                         other guys...

               Mumford doesn't have to see her face to know how much pleasure 
               this gives her, despite her hard-ass cover.

                                     NESSA
                         ...What balls on this guy? What're 
                         we...
                              (too geeky for her)
                         ...going steady? Jesus.

                                     MUMFORD
                         No again?

                                     NESSA
                              (long pause)
                         I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns 
                         me. And the last thing was insane. I 
                         don't know what's wrong with him... 
                         No magazines.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Really?

                                     NESSA
                         I don't know if I can quit. We're 
                         gonna try it together, like, you 
                         know, AA or something. And I made 
                         him give up his .22. No more sneaking 
                         around the hills with his fucking 
                         nut gun like some loony tune.

                                     MUMFORD
                         He agreed?

                                     NESSA
                              (yes)
                         He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I 
                         don't know how much longer I can put 
                         up with it. I already got two arms 
                         and legs, I don't need another 
                         appendage.

               She takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her 
               cigarette as she stands up --

                                     NESSA
                         Oops... gotta go!

               She heads toward the waiting room. Mumford gestures to 
               indicate the back door. She waves him off. He shakes his 
               head -- no one wants to use the back anymore.

               Nessa opens the door to the waiting room. Martin Brockett is 
               sitting there. He makes a gesture to Nessa to underline the 
               fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying 
               around, then stands up. She goes into his arms like maybe 
               she's the puppy. He beams and looks at Mumford.

                                     MARTIN
                         Hiya, Doc.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Martin.

                                     MARTIN
                              (pulling Nessa tighter)
                         Did you straighten her out?

               Nessa give him an affectionate punch in the side, then blows 
               smoke in his face.

                                     MUMFORD
                         How are you?

                                     MARTIN
                         Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family 
                         got five hundred times better.
                              (turning Nessa)
                         Let's go, Vanessa.

               Nessa gives Mumford an embarrassed, "ain't he corny?" look, 
               but as they go out the door, she's never looked happier.

                                     GILROY (O.S.)
                         Doctor Mumford?

               Mumford is startled to find a man in a suit, GILROY, rising 
               from the chair behind the door. He's got a briefcase and a 
               document in his hand.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I didn't see you there. Can I help 
                         you?

                                     GILROY
                         My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State 
                         Certification Board.

               He proffers the document in his hand, but Mumford doesn't 
               take it.

                                     GILROY
                         It's all right, it won't bite you. 
                         Under civil code 1294.67b you are 
                         entitled to be notified that your 
                         status and certification are being 
                         reviewed. This is the notice.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (takes the paper)
                         Do you want to come in?

                                     GILROY
                              (already leaving)
                         No thanks. Plenty of time for that 
                         when we're a little further along.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Mr. Gilroy --

               Gilroy stops, outside door already open.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What brought this on?

                                     GILROY
                         I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes 
                         it's just routine, sometimes there's 
                         been a complaint. We'll be in touch.

               He goes out. Mumford considers the paper in his hands, 
               thoughts elsewhere.

               INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON A PACKING CARTON half full of books. PULLING BACK 
               and FLOATING OVER other boxes, half-packed with Mumford's 
               personal belongings -- he doesn't have a lot. On the bed, an 
               open suitcase with a few clothes thrown in. We're STILL MOVING 
               across the room and out onto the porch, to REVEAL Mumford in 
               his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky.

               Mumford HEARS THE SHOWER GO ON downstairs at Lily's. Then 
               the MURMUR AND GIGGLE of a wet couple.

                                     SKIP (O.S.)
                         Far out!

               Mumford smiles. He gets up and goes inside, closing the door 
               behind him so as not to violate their privacy. He goes to 
               the suitcase, takes out some clothes and begins putting them 
               back in the dresser. Right now, he's not going anywhere.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Ernest Delbanco. We can't tell where he 
               is at first. As he speaks, we PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying 
               on Mumford's couch -- a patient.

                                     DELBANCO
                         ...and when you said at lunch about 
                         everybody having "a secret life", 
                         something just snapped inside me. I 
                         knew I could no longer continue my 
                         relationship with Dr. Sheeler. It 
                         was tearing me up inside. And I know 
                         Phyllis wasn't getting what she needed 
                         from it. What had started as a genuine 
                         respect, I think, for each other's 
                         professional abilities, and became, 
                         over time, a personal attraction had 
                         somehow... migrated into a rather 
                         torrid sexual relationship...

               Across the room, Mumford sits, chin in hand, displaying no 
               reaction.

                                     DELBANCO
                         ...I won't go into that today. Though, 
                         if we should continue these sessions, 
                         as I certainly hope we will, there 
                         are some aspects of that I would 
                         like to look at. God knows, I've 
                         listened to enough people giving me 
                         the juicy --
                              (catches himself)
                         ...At any rate, I just wanted to 
                         acknowledge the catalyzing effect 
                         your comment had on me. I just hope 
                         that it doesn't come roiling back 
                         upon you like some dreadful undertow.

                                     MUMFORD
                         How do you mean?

               This next is painful for Delbanco.

                                     DELBANCO
                         Well... you see, when I broke it off 
                         with Phyllis, she was naturally upset 
                         and she became more determined than 
                         ever to pursue certain -- how to put 
                         it -- doubts she's been harboring...

                                     MUMFORD
                         What kind of doubts?

                                     DELBANCO
                         About you... your background and 
                         your qualifications. I'm afraid 
                         Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in 
                         her fury with me, and actually took 
                         the whole issue to the state board.

               Mumford digests this.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I see.

                                     DELBANCO
                         And please, for whatever small way I 
                         may have encouraged this, accept my 
                         apologies.
                              (brightens)
                         There is good news, though.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What's that?

                                     DELBANCO
                         Phyllis has decided to leave town 
                         and pursue her practice in the city. 
                         Which leaves you the only psychologist 
                         in town.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm 
                         sorry to hear that.

                                     DELBANCO
                         As you can imagine, my own feelings 
                         about this are mixed... Unlike, I 
                         must say, those of my wife.

               Mumford's head snaps up. He had no idea Delbanco was married.

               EXT. GAS STATION, SMALL TOWN (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - 
               DAY

               We (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS 
               behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's 
               fantasy town. [In BLACK & WHITE.] Beyond them, Old Man 
               Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the 
               backdoor of the building. We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         Old Man Sutter's young bride had got 
                         me in hot water all right, and now I 
                         was bein' dealt the beating of my 
                         life. If there'd just been two of 
                         those bastards it would have been a 
                         little closer...

               One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace. 
               CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON:

               INT. ATTIC ROOM, BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               STILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady, cleavage 
               foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen 
               Newcomer's face with a washcloth. Beyond her, near the half-
               open door, stands her Cheerleader Daughter, worriedly chewing 
               on her thumb.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         The Landlady was good at quite a few 
                         things, but doctoring wasn't one of 
                         them...

               CUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually 
               played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for 
               the first time. He's lying in bed, his face bruised in the 
               manner of a fifties movie.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         ...Lucky for me, one of the other 
                         boarders, the broad who lived 
                         downstairs in the front room...

               BACK AT THE DOOR, the Cheerleader hears someone coming and 
               steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett, dressed now 
               in a nurse's uniform so tight the buttons are straining.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         ...was a nurse...

               As the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door, 
               Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages 
               and a bowl of steaming water, a lascivious look of concern 
               on her face.

                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
                         ...and she had ways to make you feel 
                         better they didn't teach in nursing 
                         school.

               Althea the Nurse places a bandage over Follett's eyes, 
               BLACKING OUT THE SCENE.

               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY

               Mumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch. Mumford's 
               glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the 
               end of the session. Follett snaps out of his revery and gets 
               up.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'm very happy for you, Henry.

               Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it 
               vigorously.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I feel like we're making real progress 
                         here.

                                     FOLLETT
                         Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you 
                         what that package meant to me --

               Mumford stops him with a "don't mention it" gesture. Follett 
               accepts and goes out the back door. Mumford is pleased someone 
               still wants to use that door.

               Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers 
               when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room. Not 
               expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office 
               door and opens it.

               Sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock. 
               She peers past him to see if he's alone.

                                     SOFIE
                         I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can 
                         I come in?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Of course.

               Sofie sits on the couch. Mumford sits in his chair, facing 
               her. Her voice is as strained as her manner.

                                     SOFIE
                         We haven't met in this office since 
                         that first time. This is how a real 
                         professional and his client are 
                         supposed to see each other.

               Mumford waits.

                                     SOFIE
                         It might've been more appropriate if 
                         we had followed a traditional approach 
                         to the doctor-patient relationship.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Is something wrong, Sofie?

                                     SOFIE
                         Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. 
                         Mumford.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You're upset.

                                     SOFIE
                         How intuitive! That must take years 
                         of training right there. Maybe you 
                         can guess what has upset me.

               Mumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing 
               through his mind. Finally, carefully --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Is it something you've heard about 
                         me?

                                     SOFIE
                         No, it is not something I've heard 
                         about you! It is someth--
                              (stops suddenly)
                         Why? Is there something I should 
                         have heard about you?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Why don't you tell me what's on your 
                         mind?

               Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she 
               looks around frenetically for a moment. Then, indicating the 
               couch --

                                     SOFIE
                         May I?

               Mumford gestures "of course." Sofie swings her legs up and 
               lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's 
               face. (It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.) 
               This seems to help Sofie a bit.

                                     SOFIE
                         All right... I'm going to come right 
                         out and say this, because that's 
                         what your shrink is for, right, so 
                         you can tell him what's bothering 
                         you?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Um-huh.

                                     SOFIE
                              (tone still rough)
                         First of all, I have been feeling 
                         much better lately. I don't know if 
                         the syndrome is over -- if it's just 
                         run its course or something -- but I 
                         feel a hundred per cent better than 
                         when I first came to you.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'm glad.

                                     SOFIE
                         Given that, I'm obviously not going 
                         to be judging things in the most 
                         realistic way.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I don't follow you.

                                     SOFIE
                              (sharply)
                         I'm saying that since I'm doing so 
                         much better -- which I attribute to 
                         you -- I'm liable to misinterpret 
                         some of my feelings.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (tentative)
                         Okay...

                                     SOFIE
                         The point is this -- I am not a blank 
                         page. I did not just fall off the 
                         turnip truck. Do you know what I 
                         mean?

                                     MUMFORD
                         I think so.

                                     SOFIE
                         I know a little about psychology. I 
                         took three different courses in 
                         college. It's true, none of them 
                         were above the two hundred level, 
                         but I took them... And there was one 
                         concept I remember very well.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What was that?

                                     SOFIE
                         Transference!

                                     MUMFORD
                         Transference.

                                     SOFIE
                         Yes, and that is what I have got 
                         right now. I have taken my feelings 
                         of gratitude... and relief... and 
                         transferred them onto... you. I have 
                         taken all those warm, grateful 
                         emotions and confused them with 
                         feelings for you... So that now I am 
                         under the delusion...
                              (a deep breath)
                         ...that I am in love with you.

               Mumford appears frozen in his chair. There is a heavy silence 
               in the room. Sofie does not look back there.

                                     SOFIE
                         Hello?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Hello.

                                     SOFIE
                         I think you can understand why I 
                         have some serious questions about 
                         your methods. I mean, obviously it 
                         becomes much more likely that I'm 
                         going to have confusion about this 
                         when your idea of treatment is to go 
                         walking in the woods and up to make-
                         outs-ville and do all these highly 
                         romantic activities --

               Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, but 
               refuses to acknowledge it.

                                     SOFIE
                         -- We had a paper route together, 
                         for godssake! Do you understand how 
                         I might be a little resentful? Knowing 
                         that this so-called "love" I'm feeling 
                         is totally bogus, and just a pathetic 
                         case of... transference?

               Mumford doesn't know what to say. He's on the rack. Finally --

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yes.

               Silence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back 
               of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, 
               but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze.

                                     SOFIE
                         Maybe you ought to think about how 
                         you're going to fix this. And when 
                         you do...
                              (suddenly losing her 
                              will)
                         ...please get back to me.

               Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a 
               step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.

               EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

               Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into 
               the driveway toward his stairs. Ainge leaps over the front 
               yard fence. Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Hey, Ainge.

               Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the 
               garden.

                                     LILY
                         Doc...

                                     MUMFORD
                              (keeps walking)
                         Lily.

                                     LILY
                         Doc.

               Mumford reluctantly stops. Lily comes up to the fence.

                                     LILY
                         I don't want you to be mad at Skip...

                                     MUMFORD
                         He told you.

                                     LILY
                              (yes)
                         Skip and I wouldn't have got together 
                         if it weren't for you. That's a big 
                         deal.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (dismisses it)
                         You would have met in some shower 
                         eventually...

                                     LILY
                         I want to give you something. Will 
                         you let me?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.

                                     LILY
                         Yes, you do, you damn well do.

                                     MUMFORD
                              (can't fight)
                         Okay.

                                     LILY
                         Here it is, some advice -- do the 
                         hard thing.

                                     MUMFORD
                         That's it? That's what you're giving 
                         me?

                                     LILY
                         Clean up the mess. No matter what it 
                         takes.

               Mumford leans down to pet Ainge.

                                     MUMFORD
                         What it might take is... doing time.

                                     LILY
                         Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. 
                         I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says 
                         you're in love.

               Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it.

                                     LILY
                         Then it's worth it.

               Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the 
               fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over 
               to her side.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'll tell her tonight.

               Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs.

               INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC

               Mumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange 
               juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it. 
               Distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter 
               and switches on the TV, then opens his freezer and stares 
               inside.

               UNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on. The opening segment previews a 
               story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from 
               Gianni Versace, then one about a yacht that went down near 
               Venezuela. ROBERT STACK, in his characteristic fragmented 
               delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied 
               by appropriate footage:

                                     ROBERT STACK
                         ...A drug rehabilitation center in 
                         the lonely southwestern desert... 
                         run by reclusive monks... becomes 
                         the point of departure in a mysterious 
                         vanishing...

               A CLOSE-UP of an IRS identification card featuring a picture 
               of a younger Mumford, badly photographed in suit and tie. 
               His name is not visible.

                                     ROBERT STACK
                         ...as an intrepid government 
                         investigator disappears -- without a 
                         trace.

               In the kitchen, Mumford spins to look. DISSOLVE TO:

               LATER IN THE PROGRAM. Documentary shots of IRS Headquarters, 
               etc., are INTERCUT with hokey-looking re-enactments from 
               Mumford's life -- with a YOUNG ACTOR who looks vaguely like 
               Mumford playing him.

               IN MUMFORD'S APARTMENT the telephone is RINGING. Clearly, 
               it's not the first time. Mumford, watching the show intently, 
               lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up. 
               When it immediately RINGS AGAIN, Mumford takes it off the 
               hook, cuts off the call, and buries the headset under a sofa 
               cushion.

               ON THE SHOW: scenes of tax investigation -- in the show's 
               version the IRS guys have drawn guns and are storming houses -- 
               are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug-taking.

                                     ROBERT STACK
                         ...despite brilliant promise as a 
                         fearless investigator... found himself 
                         on a downward spiral of drug abuse 
                         and dissolution...

               MUMFORD'S SISTER, the real thing, a plain, middle-aged West 
               Virginia woman, appears in a "dramatic", badly-lit interview. 
               (As with all the interviewees, she is identified by a supered 
               title.)

                                     MUMFORD'S SISTER
                         ...we didn't talk much after our 
                         folks died, but I know he felt his 
                         life had taken a wrong turn...

               A snapshot of some IRS-era party, happy revelers posing for 
               a flash. Camera PUSHES IN on Mumford, smiling and high, his 
               neck encircled by Gregory's arm. Candy is on the other side 
               of Gregory.

               A shot of the Pennsylvania Turnpike as a State Police Cruiser 
               zips by.

                                     ROBERT STACK
                         His former undercover partner at the 
                         IRS... is now a trooper with the 
                         Pennsylvania State Police...

               GREGORY, in State Police uniform, with a sadistic glint in 
               his eye, is interviewed by the roadside, cars whipping by.

                                     GREGORY
                         The guy was obsessed... didn't always 
                         know where to draw the line... but I 
                         would have trusted him with my wife -- 
                         er, my life --
                              (looks off camera, 
                              laughing)
                         -- What'd I say? Both, actually...
                              (gets serious again)
                         ...I can't say I was surprised, 
                         though, when he disappeared.

               Ragged telephoto shots of the Drug Rehab Center in the desert, 
               low, innocuous adobe buildings.

                                     ROBERT STACK
                         Who was this enigma... a courageous 
                         public servant or a debauched 
                         addict?... Either way, his last known 
                         stop was here... isolated in the 
                         Arizona desert... taken in by an 
                         order of devoted monks...

               IN AN ARIZONA TOWN, a monk with a clerical collar, BROTHER 
               TIMOTHY, is loading groceries into the back of a pick-up. 
               He's being ambush interviewed. He's polite, but not 
               cooperative.

                                     BROTHER TIMOTHY
                         We don't talk about the people who've 
                         been our guests... but I can tell 
                         you this about our order -- we believe 
                         everybody has the right to start 
                         over... everybody deserves a second 
                         chance.

               Shots of wind-swept desert, cactus, and dust-blown highway.

                                     ROBERT STACK
                         And perhaps... that is exactly the 
                         chance the now-sober pilgrim took... 
                         on a blustery November day... walking 
                         away from the rehab center... never 
                         to be heard from again...

               MUMFORD'S SISTER AGAIN:

                                     MUMFORD'S SISTER
                         I'd like to know if he's alive. If 
                         he is, I just hope he's happy and 
                         his new life is...
                              (not sure how to put 
                              it)
                         ...well, I hope he's found what he 
                         was looking for...

               Mumford, in his apartment, watches with real emotion.

               His sister's face DISSOLVES into a new snapshot of Mumford, 
               dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform, as the MUSIC on 
               the show comes up. A 1-800 telephone number appears across 
               the bottom of the frame.

                                     ROBERT STACK
                         If you have any information about 
                         this man or know anything about his 
                         whereabouts, contact the Sheriff's 
                         Department in Cochise County, Arizona, 
                         or call this number...

               EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of 
               Mumford.

               WHAT HE SEES (or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape, 
               one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering TV 
               light.

               EXT. COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

               MOVING IN on the porch steps. Mumford runs into the shot. In 
               fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of 
               breath. He takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the 
               doorbell, and waits.

               Mrs. Cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially 
               sour look on her face. She speaks through the screen door.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Well, look who's here...

                                     MUMFORD
                         Good evening, Mrs. Cook.

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Just who is here, can you tell me?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Could I see Sofie, please?

                                     MRS. COOK
                         No, you can not. I wouldn't know who 
                         to say is calling.

                                     SOFIE (O.S.)
                         Mother...

               Mrs. Cook glances inside at the as-yet-unseen Sofie, then 
               hisses at Mumford --

                                     MRS. COOK
                         I could see right through you from 
                         the start, you imposter. I know what 
                         you're after. I knew it then and I 
                         know it now!

               Sofie appears behind her mother.

                                     SOFIE
                         Mother...

                                     MUMFORD
                         What do you think I'm after, Mrs. 
                         Cook?

                                     MRS. COOK
                         Sofie. It's so obvious... you're 
                         after my daughter.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're 
                         right about that.

               Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs. 
               Cook recovers fastest --

                                     MRS. COOK
                         It'll never happen! You're in big 
                         trouble, mister.

                                     SOFIE
                              (scary strong)
                         Mother... go away!

               Mr. Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs. Cook by the arm and 
               makes her vanish. Sofie and Mumford are left alone. She looks 
               at him through the screen.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I guess you saw the show...?

                                     SOFIE
                         Which show was that?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Sofie...

                                     SOFIE
                         Part of it. We were watching "ER" 
                         until someone called.

                                     MUMFORD
                         You probably got the idea.

               Sofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at 
               him as she walks to the other end of the porch.

                                     SOFIE
                         Do you know what a betrayal this 
                         is?...

               Mumford knows.

                                     SOFIE
                         ...How violated I feel?

                                     MUMFORD
                         You're not the only one...

               Sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up.

                                     SOFIE
                         You feel violated?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Not me... all my other my patients. 
                         I smelled tar and feathers on the 
                         way over here.

                                     SOFIE
                         You deserve it.

               Mumford agrees. He watches her closely.

                                     SOFIE
                         I should be irate.

               Mumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct --

                                     SOFIE
                         I am irate!

                                     MUMFORD
                              (grabbing at the thread)
                         But...

                                     SOFIE
                         But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This 
                         is a terrible thing you've done.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I know it! Please believe me, I know 
                         that...

               Mumford steps closer to her.

                                     MUMFORD
                         But, there is one... mitigating factor 
                         I want you to consider before you 
                         write me off.

                                     SOFIE
                         What?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Will you think about it?

                                     SOFIE
                         I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad 
                         mood.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I love you. More than I've ever loved 
                         anyone or anything in my life.

               She looks into his eyes.

                                     SOFIE
                         Oh.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I want to spend the rest of my life 
                         with you... but I'm not sure you 
                         feel the same way.

               She regards him for several moments, her mind racing.

                                     SOFIE
                         I sort of do...

               Mumford feels joy. Now, finally, he takes her in his arms.

                                     SOFIE
                         ...but first, you have to tell me 
                         something...

                                     MUMFORD
                         Anything... just ask.

                                     SOFIE
                         What is your name?

               As Mumford breaks into a huge grin, CUT TO:

               INT. COURTROOM, MUMFORD COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Mumford is at the defense table. Lionel is his lawyer. Sofie, 
               Mr. Cook and Ben sit right behind the rail.

                                     JUDGE OTTO (O.S.)
                         The defendant will rise.

               Mumford and Lionel stand up.

                                     JUDGE OTTO (O.S.)
                         Sit down, Lionel.

               Lionel sits down, squelched again. We see JUDGE OTTO for the 
               first time, a tough guy in his sixties.

                                     JUDGE OTTO
                         Clarence Norman White, do you 
                         understand how serious are the crimes 
                         with which you have been charged?

                                     MUMFORD
                         I do.

                                     JUDGE OTTO
                         Do you realize how insidious it is 
                         to invade the most private thoughts 
                         and secret lives of unsuspecting 
                         people?...

               WE SEE there's a pretty big turnout for this hearing. 
               Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting 
               together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr. Delbanco and 
               MRS. DELBANCO. Gilroy, from the State Certification Board, 
               sits with the PROSECUTOR.

                                     JUDGE OTTO
                         ...People who have come to you with 
                         the faith that you know what you're 
                         doing... and that you are who you 
                         say you are?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yes, your honor.

                                     JUDGE OTTO
                         It means absolutely nothing to me 
                         that so many of your patients have 
                         come forward with praise for you and 
                         your therapeutic skills. You 
                         understand that?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Yes.

               Follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone. 
               But now he looks down the row. Althea is sitting down at the 
               end in a stylish suit, completely appropriate, but a size 
               too small.

               She gives Follett a sidelong glance, then crosses her legs 
               provocatively. Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting 
               is working really well for both of them.

                                     JUDGE OTTO
                         Mr. White, I am frustrated that the 
                         criminal code in this state allows a 
                         maximum sentence of only six months 
                         and a maximum fine of only $2000.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'm sorry, your honor.

                                     JUDGE OTTO
                         What?

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'm sorry you're frustrated.

                                     JUDGE OTTO
                         Are you disrespecting this court, 
                         Mr. White?

                                     MUMFORD
                         No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.

                                     JUDGE OTTO
                         Maybe you can empathize with this -- 
                         Maximum fine. Three months in jail, 
                         three months house arrest. Sentence 
                         to begin immediately at the Orchard 
                         Valley Correctional Facility. Case 
                         closed. This court is adjourned.

               The judge slams down his gavel, stands up and stalks out. A 
               DEPUTY moves in to take custody of Mumford. Lionel stands up 
               and leans in --

                                     LIONEL
                         It's a country club. Don't worry 
                         about it.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Thanks for your help, Lionel.

               Mumford turns to face the Cooks. Mr. Cook and Ben shake his 
               hand like he's just won something. Lionel addresses them all 
               with his usual self-satisfaction --

                                     LIONEL
                         I'll have him out in half the time.

               WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace.

                                     SOFIE
                         You got off easy.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Will you wait for me?

                                     SOFIE
                         We're only talking about six weeks.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Will you be here?

                                     SOFIE
                         Of course... I haven't got the energy 
                         to get out of town that fast.

               They kiss. The Deputy takes Mumford's arm, and we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STATE CORRECTIONAL SEDAN - DAY

               Mumford is alone in the backseat, handcuffed to a metal 
               restraint. A lone COUNTY CORRECTIONAL OFFICER is up front, 
               driving. There's a heavy security screen divider between 
               front and back.

                                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
                         Better make yourself comfortable. We 
                         got a three hour drive here.

                                     MUMFORD
                         I'm fine.

                                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
                         You're the shrink, aren't you?

                                     MUMFORD
                         No, not really.

                                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
                         But you do therapy?

                                     MUMFORD
                         Not any more.

               They ride along in silence. At peace, Mumford watches the 
               town go by. Finally --

                                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
                         I'll tell you, Doc, the wife and I, 
                         we got a little bit of a problem. 
                         Would you mind if I just ran it by 
                         you?

               The Correctional Officer watches Mumford in the rear view 
               mirror, waiting hopefully. Mumford ponders the question a 
               long time, then gives a "what the hell" shrug.

                                     MUMFORD
                         Go ahead.

               EXT. MAIN STREET, EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

               The State Correctional Sedan heads out of the business 
               district toward the highway, leaving the town of Mumford 
               behind.

               FADE OUT.

                                         THE END

               FADE IN:

               CREDITS OVER PHOTOS IN AN ALBUM

               The photos include a sepia-tone portrait of an Italian 
               immigrant family... a b&w snapshot of ROBERTA, a nine-year-
               old girl playing violin in front of a refrigerator (1950)...

               ...Roberta and her dashing Italian father, hand-carving a 
               wooden music stand... a b&w snapshot of Roberta in a communion 
               dress... Roberta at 15, playing violin in front of the same 
               refrigerator, eyes on the music stand...

               ...a color photo of two cute blonde little boys building a 
               sandcastle on a beach... a color photo of a groom in a white 
               naval uniform and his pretty bride, (Roberta at 25), her 
               hand over his as they cut their wedding cake with a sword...

               ...a color photo of Roberta and her husband Greek dancing 
               with another couple at an outdoor taverna. Roberta's husband 
               and the other man's sexy wife are exchanging a slight smile...

               HOLD ON THIS LAST PHOTO as we now see the ALBUM open on the 
               floor of a bedroom, as if it's been tossed. We are:

                         Wake up, Roberta!

               We hear the sound of KNOCKING as the CAMERA PANS a small, 
               darkened guest room. A few streaks of daylight filter through 
               Venetian blinds.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Come on, Bert -- get out of bed!

               The CAMERA finds a WOMAN lying face down on a twin bed, thick 
               wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Please, Bert -- you need to get out 
                         of that bed.

               The KNOCKING continues, and she puts the pillow over the top 
               of her head.

               END CREDITS

               INT. GUASPARI BEDROOM - DAY

               The WOMAN -- ROBERTA GUASPARI-DEMETRAS (38) -- retrieves the 
               photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it. 
               She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but 
               right now she looks like hell. She stares at the photo -- 
               it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her 
               face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. 
               There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young 
               boys' voices.

                                     BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Can you come out now, Mommy? Please?

               She puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser, 
               then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into 
               pieces.

                                     BOY #2 (O.S.)
                         Mommy, Nick broke my crayon!

                                     BOY #1 (O.S.)
                         Well, Lexi hit me and he almost 
                         broke... he almost broke my ear!

               O.S. arguing "I DID NOT!" "YES YOU DID!" "LIAR!" etc. As if 
               that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to 
               bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond 
               the wall, ignoring the O.S. voices.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hear that? Your boys need you.

               EXT. GUASPARI HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY

               ASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian-
               American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended 
               working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who 
               holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with 
               ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         But I have no room for this!

                                     OFFICER
                         I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to 
                         deliver these.

               Assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.

               HER POV

               Large wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS 
               plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing 
               the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their 
               hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several 
               VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole 
               lot more.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Instantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta 
               sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than 
               we've seen her so far.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Watch it, you idiots! Be careful 
                         with those!

               The men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the 
               violins, then up at Roberta.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         Why so many?

               Roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut.

               INT. GUASPARI LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece, 
               labelled by the U.S. NAVY. And on the floor, in the middle 
               of the boxes, are FIFTY VIOLIN CASES of various sizes, also 
               with Greek and U.S. NAVY labels. NICK (7) and LEXI (5) climb 
               over the boxes as if they were giant blocks.

                                     NICK
                              (calling)
                         Mommy, which box has our toys?

               INT. GUASPARI HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               ROBERTA'S on the phone, yelling at someone. She's still in 
               the same ratty nightgown.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Look, I know he's there, so quit 
                         lying to me!... Then check under 
                         Lana Holden -- Mrs. Lana Holden... 
                         Fine. Just tell Lieutenant Demetras 
                         that his wife called and --

               ASSUNTA grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Ma!

                                     ASSUNTA
                         No. I want you to listen to me. You 
                         can't keep doing this to yourself -- 
                         or to the boys. They need their mother 
                         now. You're a beautiful, talented 
                         woman and you have your whole life 
                         ahead of you.

                                     ROBERTA
                         If I'm so beautiful and talented, 
                         why did Charles leave me?

                                     ASSUNTA
                         Because Charles is a big jerk.
                              (beat)
                         Now get dressed.

               She exits, leaving Roberta to mull over her words.

               INT. GUASPARI KITCHEN - DAY

               Coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on 
               a rack. We recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage. 
               As Assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table, 
               Roberta enters. She's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or 
               done much with her hair. It's a start.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You really think Charles is a jerk?

                                     ASSUNTA
                         From the day you married him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Why didn't you say something?

                                     ASSUNTA
                         Since when do you listen to me?

               Roberta half-smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits 
               down at the table.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (sighs, then)
                         What am I gonna do?

                                     ASSUNTA
                         First, you eat breakfast. Second, 
                         you go out and get a job -- any job. 
                         Your boys, god-bless-em, are good 
                         eaters -- but I can't afford it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Mama, he's gonna get tired of her -- 
                         you'll see.

               Assunta's face shows she's doubtful about this.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         Well in the meantime, get a job.

               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - GIFT WRAP COUNTER - ROME, N.Y. - DAY

               Roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present 
               with ribbons, bows and stickers. At one point she even unties 
               a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. She looks 
               pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy 
               housewife. There's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a 
               long line of impatient customers. A male SUPERVISOR appears 
               behind Roberta.

                                     SUPERVISOR
                         Just wrap. You're not Picasso.

               He exits, and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task.

                                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Picasso would probably put the bows 
                         on the back of the box.

               Roberta looks up to find BRIAN TURNER (40), a handsome, sexy 
               guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Brian Turner?

                                     BRIAN
                         Hello, Roberta.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I thought you moved away.

                                     BRIAN
                         I did. I'm in town for my Mom's 
                         birthday.

               He holds out his hand. Roberta misunderstands the gesture 
               and tries to shake his hand.

                                     BRIAN
                         No -- that's her gift.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh! Sorry.

               Roberta hands him the gift she's been wrapping.

                                     BRIAN
                         It looks very pretty.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Thank you.
                              (beat)
                         I heard you had a book published. I 
                         didn't read it but...

                                     BRIAN
                         That's O.K. My parents didn't read 
                         it either. It looks good on their 
                         coffee table, though.

               Roberta smiles.

                                     BRIAN
                         So what are you doing here? I thought 
                         you'd be in Carnegie Hall by now.

               HOLD ON ROBERTA as she takes this in.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP - ROME, N.Y. - DAY

               Roberta sits opposite Brian. Her lunch is untouched.

                                     ROBERTA
                         My college professors said it was 
                         too late -- I hadn't had enough 
                         training to be a concert violinist. 
                         So I got a teaching degree instead.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'll bet you're a great teacher.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think I am. It's just that...
                              (sighs)
                         See, every time I'd get started 
                         somewhere, Charles would be 
                         transferred... then I had my kids 
                         and took time off to raise them... 
                         and then when I decided to teach 
                         again, no one would hire me 'cause 
                         you can't count on a navy wife to 
                         stick around. I finally decided I'd 
                         start my own program -- Charles gave 
                         me the money and I bought fifty 
                         violins from this little Greek shop -- 
                         got started at a private school and 
                         then...

                                     BRIAN
                         Your husband ran off with your best 
                         friend.

               A beat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         She wasn't my "best" friend. She was 
                         a friend.
                              (beat)
                         Charles is the last person you'd 
                         think would cheat on me -- he never 
                         broke a rule...
                              (a few beats)
                         I wake up one night -- it's like one 
                         in the morning -- and he's not in 
                         bed. I go outside and our neighbor -- 
                         this old Greek guy -- is sitting out 
                         there, smoking a cigar, so I ask if 
                         he's seen my husband. "He's taking a 
                         walk with the other officer's wife," 
                         he says. "He takes a walk every night 
                         with the other officer's wife."

               A beat as she gets lost in the memory. She takes a bite of a 
               french fry.

                                     ROBERTA
                         God, these are cold.

                                     BRIAN
                         So you're just gonna wrap presents 
                         and wait for him to come back?

                                     ROBERTA
                         You sound like my mother.

                                     BRIAN
                         That's not very sexy.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Are you trying to be sexy or be my 
                         friend?

                                     BRIAN
                         A little of both.

               Roberta smiles, blushing a bit. Brian looks at her, getting 
               an idea.

                                     BRIAN
                         You know, I know this really cool 
                         lady who runs this elementary school -- 
                         I wrote a piece on her. It's a public 
                         school, but it's alternative -- she 
                         might be able to create some kind of 
                         gig for you. Let me give her a call.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Great!

                                     BRIAN
                              (takes his last bite 
                              of sandwich)
                         If she hires you, though, you have 
                         to be willing to relocate.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where is it?

               EXT. SPANISH HARLEM, NEW YORK CITY - TRAVELLING SHOT - DAY

               A SALSA SONG PLAYS OVER as we see stores with Spanish names 
               and signs; Black and Latino elementary school children walking 
               home from school; some burned-out buildings; Black and Latino 
               teens playing basketball on a cement court; Spanish graffiti 
               on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is the POV of Roberta from the back 
               seat of a cab. The SALSA SONG plays on the cab's radio. 
               Roberta looks scared shitless.

               Suddenly, two YOUNG MEN flash down the middle of the street, 
               dart IN FRONT of the cab and the driver SLAMS on the brakes, 
               jerking Roberta forward.

                                     TAXI DRIVER
                         Welcome to East Harlem.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK EAST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (CPE 1) - EAST 
               HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - DAY

               INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY

               JANET WILLIAMS, a Black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits 
               behind her desk and looks at Roberta's resume. A sign on her 
               desk indicates that she's the DIRECTOR. Also on the desk is 
               a FRAMED PICTURE of Janet, her husband, daughter (14), and 
               son (12). Roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her.

                                     JANET
                              (looking at resume)
                         Aside from half a term in a private 
                         school -- in Greece -- and a year 
                         teaching chorus in Hawaii -- ten 
                         years ago -- it doesn't look like 
                         you've had any other teaching 
                         experience.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, not traditional teaching 
                         experience. I've been doing private 
                         lessons...

               Janet looks for this on the resume.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It's not on there... I taught my 
                         sons.

               Janet smiles politely.

                                     JANET
                         I'd like to help you, Mrs. Demetras. 
                         Brian spoke highly of you and I told 
                         him I'd consider starting a violin 
                         class... But without the proper 
                         qualifications, and without any 
                         experience in an inner city school...

               Roberta nods, defeated.

                                     JANET
                         I'm very sorry.

               INT. CPE 1 - HALLWAY - DAY

               Roberta stands outside Janet's office, dejectedly watching 
               the children noisily running through the hall.

               INT. AREA OUTSIDE JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

               Roberta knocks on Janet's door.

                                     JANET (O.S.)
                         Yes?

               As Roberta opens the door, we see that Nick and Lexi are 
               with her. All three have violins. INSIDE, Janet's in 
               conversation with DENNIS RAUSCH (38), an uptight man with a 
               tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. He's showing Janet a 
               large scheduling chart.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm sorry to interrupt, but I wanted 
                         you to meet my sons -- Nick, Lexi...

               They enter.

               INT. JANET'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Janet smiles at the boys, but clearly thinks Roberta's a 
               little off. Roberta holds her hand out to Dennis.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Roberta Guaspari-Demetras.

               Dennis shakes her hand, regarding her warily.

                                     JANET
                         This is Dennis Rausch, our music 
                         teacher and program coordinator.
                              (beat)
                         Mrs. Demetras, didn't I make things 
                         clear yesterday?

                                     ROBERTA
                         If I could just show you something -- 
                         it'll only take a minute.

               Before Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take 
               out their violins and get into position. Janet and Dennis 
               exchange a look.

                                     DENNIS
                         Are we having a talent show? I should 
                         have brought my tap shoes.

               Roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. The three of 
               them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an 
               ETUDE in three-part harmony. For the first measures, Janet's 
               still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over. 
               Dennis watches impassively.

               Roberta and the boys finish their piece; Janet applauds and 
               Dennis joins in to be polite. The three take bows. A beat.

                                     LEXI
                         Will you hire her now?

               Janet laughs, then gestures for them to sit.

                                     JANET
                         How long have you boys been playing?

                                     NICK
                         Since I was three.

                                     LEXI
                              (contemplates, then)
                         Maybe since I was three and a half.

                                     JANET
                         Your mom must be a good teacher.

                                     NICK
                              (shrugs)
                         She's O.K.

               Roberta gives Nick a look, but Janet smiles.

                                     JANET
                              (to Roberta)
                         If you could teach our students to 
                         play like that, I'd be thrilled, but --

                                     ROBERTA
                         I can. Any child can learn the violin.

                                     DENNIS
                         Assuming they had the discipline.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'll teach them to have discipline.

                                     JANET
                         A lot of our parents are struggling 
                         to feed their kids and pay the rent -- 
                         they don't have time to help them 
                         learn violin.

                                     ROBERTA
                         They don't have to. If they can help, 
                         great -- but these kids will be 
                         committed. They'll practice on their 
                         own, they'll help each other in the 
                         classroom --

               Dennis laughs. Roberta looks at him, a bit miffed.

                                     DENNIS
                              (with an edge)
                         I think I know these students, Miss 
                         Demetras. Their attention span doesn't 
                         go past do-re-mi. Maybe on a good 
                         day, I can get them to "fa."

                                     ROBERTA
                         You're underestimating them. They 
                         can play as well as any other kids.

                                     DENNIS
                         That I'd like to see.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You will.

               A beat. Janet observes the tension, then turns to Roberta.

                                     JANET
                              (to Roberta)
                         For now I'll put you down as a sub, 
                         but I have to warn you -- even if it 
                         works out, the Board may not let me 
                         create a permanent position for you.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That's O.K. I'll worry about that 
                         later.
                              (with a grateful look)
                         Thank you.

               We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face.

                                     DENNIS
                              (to Janet)
                         Well, I've already planned out the 
                         whole term, and I can tell you right 
                         now, there's no room for this! 
                         Besides, where you gonna find money 
                         for violins?

                                     ROBERTA
                         You need violins?

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               In a noisy music room with bad acoustics, Roberta tries to 
               take control of fifty kids, third through fifth-graders, who 
               are in a state of manic excitement over the FIFTY VIOLIN 
               CASES on the floor.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (gently)
                         Please do not open the cases, O.K.?

               They ignore her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Look, can everyone just settle down 
                         and listen to me -- please?

               ANGLE - Three girls open their cases.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (starting to lose it)
                         Keep them closed! Please.

               ANGLE - Two boys open their cases.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to the boys)
                         Did you hear what I just said?

               ANGLE - Three kids are using the violin cases as pretend 
               machine guns -- and shooting each other.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Put those down, please!

               ANGLE - A boy and a girl are having a "sword fight" with 
               their bows.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to the fencers)
                         Don't do that! Put the bows back in 
                         the cases -- right now!

               There's the SOUND of violin strings being plucked.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Who's plucking?

               Roberta wheels around to find a girl plucking her violin 
               like a banjo, and doing a little dance. This is LUCY, a skinny 
               Puerto Rican girl in perpetual motion.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What have I been saying? Put that 
                         away! Back in the case!

               Roberta takes a breath. The kids settle down a bit.

                                     ROBERTA
                         O.K. Thank you. That's much better.
                              (takes another breath)
                         I'll be dividing you into five 
                         classes, but for today --

               ANGLE - A boy plays "bongos" on his violin case.

                                     ROBERTA
                         O.K. -- that's it! You! Stand up!

               The bongo player stands.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You will be the first student who 
                         will NOT be in my violin class. Out!

               The child looks stunned.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I said OUT!

               With a sheepish expression, he exits. The room is finally 
               quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked. She 
               puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Who else would like to be kicked out 
                         of my class?

               The students stare at her, afraid of her now. DE SEAN, a 
               small but tough Black boy, raises his hand.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Are you raising your hand because 
                         you want to be kicked out?

                                     DE SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Why?

                                     DE SEAN
                         I don't wanna learn no stupid violin. 
                         It's for wimps.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Who told you that?

                                     DE SEAN
                         I just know.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What's your name?

                                     BOY
                         De Sean.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, De Sean -- you haven't given 
                         me a good enough reason, so you're 
                         staying.

               She looks around the room.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Anyone else?

               Silence.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - LATER

               In front of the class, Roberta helps NAEEM, a graceful Black 
               boy, hold the violin. He has a serious expression and a scar 
               on his left cheek. Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard, 
               but it appears that the boy is playing music. He smiles.

                                     NAEEM
                         Hey, I play pretty good.

               Roberta laughs.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to Naeem)
                         See how easy it is?
                              (to the class)
                         Maybe in the spring, we could have a 
                         big concert for your families and 
                         for the whole school.
                              (to the boy)
                         What's your name?

                                     NAEEM
                         Naeem.

               Roberta writes in a notebook and we see that she's measuring 
               for violin sizes.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to class)
                         If you listen to me and do exactly 
                         what I say, you're gonna sound 
                         beautiful at the concert and you're 
                         gonna be so proud of yourselves.
                              (to Naeem)
                         Good, Naeem. Your hand's staying 
                         soft.
                              (to the class)
                         But if you don't listen to me, you'll 
                         sound so bad that your own parents 
                         will feel sick when they hear you. 
                         They might even throw up.

               ON THE KIDS, not used to a teacher speaking like that.

               INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               A funky apartment on the Upper West Side. Nick and Lexi are 
               both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor, 
               their suitcases nearby. Brian tiptoes past them, carrying 
               two glasses of champagne. He knocks on his office door.

                                     ROBERTA (O.S.)
                         Come in.

               INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her 
               hair. She's tidying up her suitcase, etc., next to an old 
               couch that's been made up as a bed. Leftist political books 
               line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his 
               own, TO HELL AND BACK: INTERVIEWS WITH VIETNAM VETS by BRIAN 
               TURNER. His desk is covered with files and books pertaining 
               to MIGRANT WORKERS. Brian enters.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (referring to champagne)
                         What's this?

                                     BRIAN
                         It's a toast.
                              (giving her a glass, 
                              holding his up)
                         To Roberta, who's made it through 
                         her first week.

               They clink glasses and drink.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I don't know, Brian. I'm hanging on 
                         by a thread there. Out of fifty kids, 
                         maybe six are listening to me.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look at the progress. Didn't you say 
                         no one was listening to you on Monday?

               Roberta laughs.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I really appreciate all you've done 
                         for us. And I promise -- this weekend 
                         I'll start looking for a place.

                                     BRIAN
                         There's no rush.

                                     ROBERTA
                         No, we've put you out enough. You're 
                         supposed to be writing, not 
                         babysitting for us.
                              (crosses to his desk, 
                              flips through his 
                              Vietnam book)
                         I've started your book. It's very 
                         powerful.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thank you.

               Brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck. 
               Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not 
               really happening.

                                     ROBERTA
                         So what made you choose migrant 
                         workers for your next book? I mean, 
                         how do you know what to write about?

                                     BRIAN
                              (kissing her neck)
                         I follow my gut, pay attention to 
                         what I'm being drawn to...

               Roberta's aroused, in spite of herself. She turns around and 
               faces him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What are you doing?

                                     BRIAN
                         I've been waiting to do that since 
                         Mr. Baines' orchestra class.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You didn't even notice me!

                                     BRIAN
                         Sure I did. You used to ignore me 
                         and it drove me wild.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You had at least five different 
                         girlfriends.

                                     BRIAN
                         It didn't mean I had the one I wanted.

               He gives her a flirtatious smile, then takes out one of her 
               rollers.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're not a navy wife anymore...

               He moves to takes out another roller and Roberta stops him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yes I am... legally.

                                     BRIAN
                         And is it a navy requirement that 
                         you dress like it's the 1950's?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I do not!

                                     BRIAN
                              (goading her)
                         Who did you vote for in the last 
                         election?

                                     ROBERTA
                         What does that have to do with 
                         anything?

                                     BRIAN
                         Tell me.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (hesitates, then)
                         I don't know. Charles filled out my 
                         absentee ballot.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh my God -- it's even worse than I 
                         thought!
                              (touching her hair)
                         Is this the same Roberta who got the 
                         orchestra to strike until they gave 
                         us new uniforms?

               She laughs wistfully, then looks a little sad.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That Roberta's not around anymore.

               He pulls her towards him by the belt to her robe.

                                     BRIAN
                         I don't believe that.

               They kiss and it heats up quickly. Roberta pulls back.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I shouldn't.

                                     BRIAN
                         Because?

                                     ROBERTA
                         The boys --

                                     BRIAN
                         They're sleeping.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I know, but... I'm still married.

                                     BRIAN
                         And what's your husband doing right 
                         now?

               A few beats, and she moves towards him.

               INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Sun streams into the room as Roberta awakens in Brian's bed, 
               a look of afterglow on her face. She suddenly remembers where 
               she is, and quickly looks at the clock.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh shit -- the boys.

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         They're still sleeping.

               She turns, relieved, until she sees that Brian's packing a 
               suitcase.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where are you going?

                                     BRIAN
                         Texas.

               He dashes out. Roberta sits up, rattled by this news.

               INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brian excitedly gathers papers and files scattered around 
               his electric typewriter.

                                     ROBERTA (O.S.)
                         What's in Texas?

               He turns to see Roberta in the doorway.

                                     BRIAN
                         Farm workers. I just got the call -- 
                         it came through -- my research grant! 
                         It came through! Isn't that great?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Today?

               He places items into a carry-on bag, packing at a rapid clip. 
               In contrast, Roberta seems to be moving in slow motion.

                                     BRIAN
                         I've got a few families lined up 
                         there, some in California --

                                     ROBERTA
                         How long will you be gone?

                                     BRIAN
                         Two, three months.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?

               INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Brian throws toiletries into a plastic bag. Roberta enters.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I thought... I just thought you were 
                         gonna be around. And then last night --

               He stops what he's doing and looks at her.

                                     BRIAN
                         Whoa. Roberta -- last night was great 
                         but did you think I was gonna marry 
                         you in the morning?

                                     ROBERTA
                         No! Of course not.

               We see in her face that part of her did think that.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It's just that... we just got here 
                         and we're barely... I don't even 
                         know where to buy groceries.

               Brian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is. He takes her 
               in his arms.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're gonna be fine. You have a 
                         job, a place to stay, your kids have 
                         a school to go to -- and there's a 
                         D'Agostino's around the corner.

               She attempts a smile.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Congratulations.

               He kisses her forehead, then exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking 
               hurt and frightened.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Roberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids -- 
               third through fifth-grade -- who sit on the floor next to 
               their violin cases. The kids are Black and Latino, with a 
               couple of white faces. They're all talking and ignoring 
               Roberta except for NAEEM and GUADALUPE, a petite Mexican 
               girl with a long dark braid. [NOTE: We'll see other violin 
               students from time to time, but this is the class we'll follow 
               for Roberta's first year]

                                     ROBERTA
                         And what am I doing now?

                                     NAEEM/GUADALUPE
                         Rosining the bow.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Good. And what am I doing when I 
                         turn this little screw?
                              (raising her voice)
                         Everyone stop talking. Right now!

               The kids quiet down. Only Naeem raises his hand.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Naeem?

                                     NAEEM
                         Tightening the horse hair.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (touches the heel of 
                              the bow)
                         And what do we call this?

               Again, only Naeem raises his hand. Roberta sees him but turns 
               to DE SEAN, who's talking to his neighbor.

                                     ROBERTA
                         De Sean?

                                     DE SEAN
                         Yeah?

                                     ROBERTA
                         What do we call this?

                                     DE SEAN
                         I don't know.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Why not?

                                     DE SEAN
                         I wasn't here.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yes you were but you weren't paying 
                         attention! Do you want people to 
                         think you're stupid?

               This makes De Sean blush -- and it pisses him off.

                                     ROBERTA
                         All right, Naeem -- tell them.

                                     NAEEM
                         It's called the frog.

               Some kids giggle and joke about this. Roberta points to the 
               scroll of the violin.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Anyone remember what this is?

               LUCY, the fidgety girl, snaps her fingers.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Lucy! Do you like people snapping 
                         their fingers when you're talking?

                                     LUCY
                         Yeah!

               The kids laugh. Roberta doesn't. She points to the scroll.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What is this called?

                                     LUCY
                         The jeri curl?

               Roberta laughs, even though she's trying to be tough.

               INT. DENNIS' MUSIC CLASSROOM - DAY

               Dennis's twenty students play recorder in rows of attached 
               theatre-style seats. Dennis sits at his desk, a METRONOME 
               ticking, and apathetically leads them in scales, using a red 
               pen as a baton. He keeps one eye on a stack of quizzes that 
               he's marking, stopping to circle mistakes with the pen.

                                     DENNIS
                         C-C-C-C, D-D-D-D, E-E-E-E...

               ANGLE - Roberta stands in the hallway at the open door, 
               dismayed by Dennis' uninspired teaching. She enters and 
               crosses to Dennis, speaking quietly to him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Excuse me -- sorry to interrupt --

               The students immediately start to chatter.

                                     DENNIS
                         No talking!

               He looks back at Roberta, annoyed by her intrusion.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm supposed to take kids out of 
                         Miss Cooper's classroom for my ten 
                         o'clock class -- there's nobody there.

                                     DENNIS
                         Miss Cooper's students have phys ed 
                         on Tuesdays.

                                     ROBERTA
                         But you scheduled them for violin.

                                     DENNIS
                         You must have read the schedule wrong.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (trying to remain 
                              polite)
                         I don't think so.

                                     DENNIS
                         Well, I can't solve this problem for 
                         you right now.
                              (nods to his class)
                         I'm trying to teach.

                                     ROBERTA
                         So am I.

               She exits.

               INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Lexi and Nick are in Brian's bed. Roberta's tucking in Lexi; 
               he holds a toy truck with Greek writing on it.

                                     LEXI
                         Can I bring a puppy for show and 
                         tell tomorrow?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Honey, we don't have a puppy.

                                     NICK
                         Daddy said we could get one when we 
                         moved back to America.

               Roberta looks at Nick, then turns back to Lexi.

                                     ROBERTA
                         How about your truck? I'll bet you're 
                         the only one in school with a truck 
                         from Greece.

                                     NICK
                         When's Daddy coming back?

               Roberta turns to Nick and tucks him in.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, he's still on his tour, so 
                         we'll just have to see but... It 
                         shouldn't be too much longer.

                                     LEXI
                         Is he gonna live with us and Brian?

                                     ROBERTA
                         No, honey. We're just staying at 
                         Brian's house for a little while.

               She turns back to Nick who looks worried. She kisses him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Good night, sweetie.

               She kisses Lexi, then reaches to turn off the lamp.

                                     NICK
                         No! Leave it on.

               Roberta nods, smiles at her sons, and exits.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Nine children stand, violins under their right arms, bows 
               hanging down from their right hands, and try to position 
               their feet as Roberta addresses them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Now take the right foot and put it 
                         on a tile. Good. Now with the other 
                         foot take a tiny step forward and 
                         put it on a line. Try to make a box 
                         with your feet --

               She walks over to BENJAMIN, a white boy with glasses, and 
               corrects his feet. She sees Lucy dancing in place.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Lucy! Would you like to leave the 
                         class right now?

               Lucy nods, giggling. Roberta walks down the row of students.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You should feel very strong -- so 
                         strong and balanced that if I wanted 
                         to knock you over I couldn't.

               She crosses to TANISHA, a sweet-natured Black girl with her 
               hair in tiny braids, and gently pushes her belly.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You see? If you're standing strong, 
                         I can't even push you.

               Roberta turns to De Sean, who's talking to JAMES, a pudgy 
               Black/Puerto Rican boy.

                                     ROBERTA
                         De Sean! James! Quiet!
                              (as she crosses to 
                              another student)
                         Does anyone know where Naeem is?

                                     TANISHA
                         I saw him this morning but he's not 
                         here.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yes, I know he's not here -- that's 
                         why I'm asking.

               She gently pushes Guadalupe's belly. The girl stumbles back.

                                     ROBERTA
                         See how I pushed you? It means your 
                         feet aren't centered.

               Guadalupe tries to correct her feet. Roberta bends down to 
               help and sees that the little girl wears LEG BRACES under 
               her pants. Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Can you bring over a chair?
                              (to Guadalupe)
                         It's probably better for you to sit.

               The boy brings the chair. Guadalupe sits, embarrassed.

               EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

               Roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and 
               parents picking them up. She sees Naeem and crosses to him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where were you today, Naeem?

                                     NAEEM
                         I can't be in violin class anymore.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Why not?

                                     NAEEM
                         My mother won't let me.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?

               NAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an 
               attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of 
               African fabric.

                                     MRS. ADISA
                         My son's got more important things 
                         to do than learn dead white men's 
                         music.

                                     ROBERTA
                         They're gonna learn "Twinkle Twinkle 
                         Little Star"!

                                     MRS. ADISA
                         How many Black classical composers 
                         can you name? How many Black classical 
                         violinists do you know?

                                     ROBERTA
                         That doesn't mean it's the way it 
                         should be. Naeem's learning to play 
                         music -- and that makes him feel 
                         good about himself. Why should it 
                         matter who wrote it?

                                     NAEEM
                         Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class?

               Mrs. Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then 
               addresses Roberta.

                                     MRS. ADISA
                         Look. I've seen this before. You 
                         white women come up here and think 
                         you can rescue our poor inner city 
                         children who never asked to be rescued 
                         in the first place. No thank you.

               She walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then 
               turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them.

               INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta attempts to read Brian's book, To Hell and Back: 
               Interviews with Vietnam Vets, but she's distracted. She 
               glances at her purse, then back to the book. She puts the 
               book down and dials the phone.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Brian Turner's room, please.

               While she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book 
               jacket. There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to 
               straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes 
               out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures.

               INSERT - PICTURES

               Charles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were 
               3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home 
               in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them.

               BACK TO ROBERTA

               She's really depressed herself now.

               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

               ALICE CROWLEY (50's), a no-nonsense Black teacher, shows her 
               fifth-graders a globe. She doesn't turn as Roberta enters 
               and crosses to her. In the b.g. we see ROBERTA'S STUDENTS 
               waiting in THE HALL.

                                     ALICE
                         And which ocean is this?

               Kids simultaneously yell out "ATLANTIC" and "PACIFIC."

                                     ROBERTA
                         Excuse me... I'm here for the violin 
                         students.

                                     ALICE
                              (icy)
                         You're late.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Just a couple of minutes -- I'm sorry.

                                     ALICE
                         They're having a lesson now.

                                     ROBERTA
                         But this is when they have violin 
                         class!

                                     ALICE
                         That's not my problem.

               Roberta's reluctant to argue in front of the kids; she exits.

               EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

               Lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess. 
               Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep 
               up.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I thought all the teachers agreed to 
                         this.

                                     JANET
                         In theory.
                              (to a student)
                         Adam! I want you in my office right 
                         after lunch, you understand?

                                     ADAM
                         What'd I do?

                                     JANET
                         Think about it!
                              (to Roberta)
                         Whenever you pull kids out, it's a 
                         disruption, plus it's extra work for 
                         the teacher 'cause they have to fill 
                         the kids in on what they missed. 
                         Some teachers resent it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, can't you talk to them?

               Janet stops walking and pulls a box cutter out of her pocket.

                                     JANET
                         I took this off a second-grader this 
                         morning. I'll help you Roberta -- 
                         but I can't hold your hand here.

               Janet starts to walk away, then turns.

                                     JANET
                         A word of advice? When you're picking 
                         up your students, go to Alice's 
                         classroom first.

               Roberta stands there as Janet walks on ahead.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               The nine children hold their violins in position as Roberta 
               addresses them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         So pretend you're driving a car and 
                         I'm the policeman and I say STOP! 
                         Thumb up, fingers straight up, flat 
                         palm. Now you be policemen, but turn 
                         your hand and make it say stop to 
                         yourself.

               ON THE CHILDREN, attempting this. She walks around and helps.

                                     DE SEAN
                              (to himself)
                         You're under arrest.

               Some kids crack up and start joking and chatting.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Knock it off, De Sean!
                              (to all)
                         If you kids can't take this seriously, 
                         I don't want you here. I'm teaching 
                         you a difficult instrument because I 
                         respect you and have faith that you 
                         can learn it. But none of that matters 
                         if you don't have respect for 
                         yourself.

               Some of the children think about what she's saying. A couple, 
               uncomfortable with the intensity, hold back giggles.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Now turn your wrist so it's flat 
                         against the fingerboard, and that's 
                         how you'll set up your hand...

               Roberta sees Guadalupe struggling.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Guadalupe! You've got the violin in 
                         the wrong hand! How did that happen?

               Embarrassed, Guadalupe corrects her position.

               INT. BRIAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               At the small kitchen table, Nick does homework and Lexi puts 
               stickers in a sticker book. Roberta's cooking dinner; she 
               grabs a potholder and checks on a bubbling lasagna in the 
               oven. The PHONE RINGS and she answers it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Hello?

                                     CHARLES (O.S.)
                         Hello, Bobbi.

               Her face falls as she hears the voice. She holds onto the 
               counter to steady herself.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where are you?

                                     CHARLES (O.S.)
                              (calm, detached)
                         I'm back in the States. I'm at my 
                         parents.

               Roberta closes the oven and gathers her courage.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Are you still with her?

               A beat.

                                     CHARLES (O.S.)
                         No.

               We watch Roberta's body collapse into a sense of overwhelming 
               relief. FOLLOW HER as she steps into THE HALLWAY, then 
               stretches the phone into:

               INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

               She half-closes the door, leans against the sink and starts 
               to cry.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (through tears)
                         We've missed you so much, Charles. 
                         The boys... they can't wait for you 
                         to come home... I know we'll have a 
                         lot to work out and it won't be easy 
                         right away, but we're gonna get 
                         through this, you know? We're a family 
                         and we belong together and --

                                     CHARLES (O.S.)
                              (more emotive than 
                              before)
                         Bobbi -- stop, O.K.? Just stop.

               Roberta looks as if she's been slapped. A beat.

                                     CHARLES (O.S.)
                         I want a divorce.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?

               Silence.

                                     ROBERTA
                         But you said... you and Lana... you 
                         said it was over.

                                     CHARLES (O.S.)
                         It is.
                              (beat)
                         It's over between us too, Bobbi.

               HOLD ON ROBERTA, devastated. ANGLE on NICK, watching her 
               through the door.

               INT. BRIAN'S HOTEL ROOM, TEXAS - NIGHT

               Brian's on the phone with Roberta. He's in a t-shirt and 
               sweats, and his papers are scattered on the bed.

                                     ROBERTA (O.S.)
                         He wouldn't even talk about it! No 
                         explanations, no discussion...

               INTERCUT

               Roberta in Brian's living room. She's extremely agitated and 
               her eyes are puffy from crying.

                                     BRIAN
                         I can't believe you were still holding 
                         out hope. The guy hasn't called you 
                         or the kids in three months -- I 
                         thought you'd moved on.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I never said that.

                                     BRIAN
                         No? Maybe not with words.

               This embarrasses her, then pisses her off.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You know what? I shouldn't have called 
                         you. This was a mistake.

                                     BRIAN
                         No, no -- I'm sorry. Look, I know it 
                         hurts, but you're gonna get through 
                         this, Roberta -- you will.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm moving back to my Mom's.

                                     BRIAN
                         What? You're gonna quit teaching in 
                         the middle of the term?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I don't fit in there -- I'm not making 
                         any progress with the kids...

                                     BRIAN
                         What are you gonna tell Janet -- 
                         your husband left you and nothing 
                         else matters?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I don't know yet.

               INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta lies awake on the futon, heartbroken.

               INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta stands and watches Nick and Lexi sleep. She lies 
               down beside them and closes her eyes.

               INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

               Roberta walks through crowds of kids towards Janet who's in 
               the middle of confronting a boy student. Janet holds a FIFTY-
               DOLLAR BILL. Roberta hangs back and waits for a chance to 
               speak.

                                     BOY
                         My mother gave it to me.

                                     JANET
                         Why would she give you fifty dollars?

                                     BOY
                         To buy breakfast.

               Janet gives him a stern look.

                                     JANET
                         Do you know how hard your mother 
                         works? Do you think it's right for 
                         you steal from her?

                                     BOY
                         I didn't!

                                     JANET
                         Well let's go call her right now and 
                         ask her.

               As Janet turns to walk off, Roberta crosses to her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I need to speak to you. It's 
                         important.

                                     JANET
                         It'll have to wait.
                              (to the boy)
                         Come on. In my office.

               Roberta watches as Janet dashes off with the boy in tow.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Guadalupe sits on a chair in the empty room, struggling to 
               set up her violin. Roberta enters, surprised to see her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Guadalupe? What are you doing here?

                                     GUADALUPE
                         I can't get the stop sign.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Honey, your teacher's probably looking 
                         for you.

               Guadalupe sighs, then hands Roberta the violin.

                                     GUADALUPE
                         I can't come anymore. It's too hard.

                                     ROBERTA
                         The violin is hard for everyone.

                                     GUADALUPE
                         But everyone else is better than me. 
                         I'll always be slow.

               Roberta looks at her sadly and puts the violin in its case.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Did you ever hear of Itzhak Perlman?

                                     GUADALUPE
                         No.

                                     ROBERTA
                         He's one of the greatest violinists 
                         in the world, and he has problems 
                         with his legs too. He walks with two 
                         canes -- but he still makes the most 
                         beautiful music.

                                     GUADALUPE
                         And he sits down when he plays?

                                     ROBERTA
                         He has to.

               Guadalupe takes this in.

                                     GUADALUPE
                         He was your student?

               Roberta laughs.

                                     ROBERTA
                         No. But if he was, I'd tell him the 
                         same thing I'm telling you. You 
                         shouldn't quit something just because 
                         it's hard.

                                     GUADALUPE
                         But I can't stand strong.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Standing strong doesn't only mean 
                         using your legs. You can stand strong 
                         on the inside too.
                              (beat)
                         Know what I mean?

               Guadalupe nods. Roberta holds out the violin case. Guadalupe 
               lunges forward and hugs her around the waist. Roberta 
               awkwardly accepts the hug, startled and touched by it, and 
               strokes the girl's hair. Guadalupe lets go, takes the violin 
               and exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA as she absorbs what just happened. 
               JANET pokes her head into the room.

                                     JANET
                         You wanted to speak to me?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh. Umm -- that's O.K. It's taken 
                         care of.

               Janet looks at her curiously, then exits.

               INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - EAST HARLEM - DAY

               Roberta walks around an empty, rundown apartment, her 
               expression somber. Crayon markings on the walls, cigarette 
               burns on the floors, a filthy bathroom and kitchen. An older 
               Puerto Rican woman stands back as Roberta inspects the place. 
               Roberta wipes grease off one of the windows.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Is just for you and your boys?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yes.

                                     LANDLADY
                         No husband? No boyfriend?

               A beat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         No.

               EXT. SCHOOL YARD - LUNCH RECESS - DAY

               Roberta enters the yard from inside the school. It's filled 
               with kids playing, including Nick and Lexi. She waves to 
               them and Lexi runs up to her, carrying a piece of artwork.

                                     LEXI
                         Look what I made you, Mommy!

               He gives her a tempera PAINTING of a man's face, the 
               background decorated with glued-on macaroni. It says DADDY.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (covering her 
                              discomfort)
                         That is so beautiful!

               He runs off. Roberta exhales, sits down alone on a bench and 
               takes out her lunch. She smiles at ALICE CROWLEY and another 
               TEACHER but they cross to another bench. ISABEL VASQUEZ (25) 
               approaches, a lively Puerto Rican woman with a strong New 
               York accent.

                                     ISABEL
                         Whatsa matter -- you got cooties?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Apparently.

                                     ISABEL
                         I'll take my chances.
                              (extends a hand)
                         Isabel Vasquez. Second grade.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Roberta Demetras. I'm the --

                                     ISABEL
                         Violin teacher. I know.

               She sits down beside Roberta, takes out her lunch.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Is it my imagination, or does everyone 
                         hate me?

                                     ISABEL
                         It's hard to fit in when you're doing 
                         a special program. People figure 
                         you're not gonna be here very long, 
                         so why make the effort?
                              (beat)
                         It may take a while for folks to 
                         warm up, but nobody hates you.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (sotto)
                         What about Alice Crowley?

                                     ISABEL
                              (sotto)
                         A) she thinks the violin's a waste 
                         of time... and B) -- she's a bitch.

               Roberta laughs.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And then there's Dennis.

                                     ISABEL
                         The Music Man. You've had the bodacity 
                         to threaten his private little empire -- 
                         not to mention the fact that you 
                         messed up his sacred scheduling chart.

                                     ROBERTA
                         How come you're being nice to me?

                                     ISABEL
                         Ulterior motives. I want my daughter 
                         in your class next year.

               Roberta smiles.

                                     ROBERTA
                         If I'm here next year.

                                     ISABEL
                         You will be.

               INT. ROBERTA'S NEW APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               LEXI'S PAINTING is on the wall, along with a crayon drawing 
               of himself, Roberta, and Nick in front of a house.

               ANGLE - ROBERTA looks out the window. She's gotten some used 
               furniture, cleaned the place, and it's less depressing.

               ROBERTA'S POV OUT THE WINDOW

               On the street below, three prostitutes stand at the corner. 
               Two men sit on a stoop, smoking a joint, and in a parked 
               car, three men seem to be making a drug deal. One of the 
               buildings on the street is burned out, missing a front door.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Nick, in his pajamas, enters and crosses to his mother. She 
               smiles at him and they both look out the window.

                                     NICK
                         In Greece, we could see the ocean. 
                         Remember?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I remember. And the fishing boats...

                                     NICK
                         And the octopuses.

               Roberta smiles and puts her arm around him.

                                     NICK
                         Is Daddy coming here soon?

               Roberta tenses up.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, that's something I've been 
                         wanting to talk to you about. Daddy's 
                         not gonna live with us anymore. You 
                         and Lexi will have special times 
                         when you stay with him, like at 
                         Christmas.

               A beat.

                                     NICK
                         Can you tell the birthday story?

               Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to 
               her news.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Don't you want to talk about what I 
                         told you?

                                     NICK
                         I want to hear the birthday story.

               A beat as she contemplates whether to push or not, then:

                                     ROBERTA
                         It was the day of Grandpa's birthday, 
                         and I was sad because he had died a 
                         few months back.

                                     NICK
                         But you knew I'd be born that day.

                                     ROBERTA
                         So I packed a bag and got all ready --

                                     NICK
                         And Daddy laughed.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I said, "It's my father's birthday, 
                         and the baby's gonna be born today."

                                     NICK
                         He didn't believe you. But I was 
                         born. The same day as Grandpa.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It was a happy day.

                                     NICK
                         Was Daddy happy too?

               She looks at him, taken aback by the question.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Of course he was.

                                     NICK
                         Then why is he leaving me?

               Roberta, overcome with emotion, can barely answer.

                                     ROBERTA
                         He's not leaving you, Nick. He loves 
                         you and Lexi very much.

                                     NICK
                         Then why can't he live here?

                                     ROBERTA
                              (struggling)
                         It's very hard to explain... Sometimes 
                         things happen between grown-ups... 
                         and they just can't be together.

               The CAMERA moves behind them as they continue to look out 
               the window, and we see Nick move away from his mother.

               The kids play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and they sound 
               awful. Roberta looks disgusted as she leads them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Slow bows! Slow bows! Don't squeeze! 
                         Stop! Everybody stop!
                              (to De Sean)
                         How much did you practice this week?

                                     DE SEAN
                         My asthma -- it was very bad and I 
                         had to go to the hospital.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Again? You told me you went to the 
                         hospital last week.

                                     DE SEAN
                         Oh yeah. Maybe it was last week.

               Roberta rolls her eyes, then turns to Lucy.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Lucy -- you sounded the worst of 
                         all. Have you practiced?

                                     LUCY
                         No.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Why not? You can't be in this class 
                         if you don't practice!

                                     LUCY
                         My grandma got mugged.

               A beat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh. I'm sorry. Is she O.K.?

                                     LUCY
                         She died.

               Roberta stands there, sobered.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm really sorry, Lucy.
                              (tries to get her 
                              bearings)
                         Just do the best you can.

               EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

               A group of kids stand together with their violins and chat. 
               Roberta exits the building and they greet her. She waves 
               back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with 
               Lucy. She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them.

                                     NAEEM
                         Hi, Roberta.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Hi, Naeem. Can I talk to your mom 
                         for a minute?

               Naeem nods and moves off.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Look, I didn't come up here to rescue 
                         anybody. I'm a single mother and I 
                         needed a job. And I know you think 
                         you're protecting your son, but you're 
                         not. I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's 
                         mother had stopped him from playing 
                         tennis because it's a "white man's 
                         game"?
                              (beat)
                         The important thing is that when 
                         Naeem plays music, his whole face 
                         lights up. You should see him.

               Mrs. Adisa takes this in. Roberta exits. Mrs. Adisa looks 
               for Naeem and sees him watching the violin students, longing 
               to be among them. She watches her son with compassion.

               EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY

               Roberta and the boys shop in a colorful outdoor produce market 
               in their neighborhood.

               The boys suddenly rush over to A MAN sitting on the ground 
               with mixed-breed PUPPIES in a cardboard box. The boys pet 
               them excitedly. Roberta watches her sons; they're happier 
               than she's seen them in ages.

               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               A brown puppy is jumping all over Nick and Lexi who laugh 
               delightedly. Roberta is putting down newspapers.

                                     ROBERTA
                         We all have to take turns cleaning 
                         up, O.K.?

               The boys are oblivious to her -- they're in heaven.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to herself)
                         Yeah, right.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Roberta's SCREAMING at the kids as they play "Twinkle Twinkle 
               Little Star."

                                     ROBERTA
                         First finger on the E! Three -- two -- 
                         one -- open!
                              (to a white girl with 
                              pigtails)
                         Wrong string, Becky! We've done this 
                         fourteen times! And look at your 
                         nails! You're supposed to cut them 
                         for violin class! O.K, everybody 
                         stop! It sounds horrible! I can't 
                         believe how bad it sounds!

               They stop playing. Tanisha raises her hand.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Is this an important question, 
                         Tanisha?

               Tanisha nods.

                                     TANISHA
                         Do you have two of those skirts?

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?

                                     TANISHA
                         You wore a skirt just like it on 
                         Monday.

               Some of the kids crack up.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You know, Tanisha -- I don't think 
                         that's such an important question.
                              (to class)
                         O.K. Let's try --

               The door opens and Naeem enters with Mrs. Adisa. Roberta 
               crosses to them.

                                     MRS. ADISA
                         Naeem and I were wondering if he 
                         could still be in the class.

               A beat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'd love that.
                              (to Naeem)
                         You'll have a lot of catching up to 
                         do. You think you can work that hard?

                                     NAEEM
                         Yeah, I can.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Maybe we can also arrange some private 
                         lessons at my house.

                                     MRS. ADISA
                         I wouldn't have the money for that.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That's O.K.
                              (to Naeem)
                         Why don't you go grab one of my spare 
                         violins?

               Naeem happily runs to the extra violins at the front of the 
               room; Mrs. Adisa nods to Roberta with a look of gratitude, 
               then exits. Roberta crosses back to the front of the room.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to class)
                         Let's try it again.

               They begin again, and we see Naeem take out a violin and 
               join in. As they play, Roberta's ears perk up at something 
               she's hearing. She crosses to Lucy.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What are you playing?

                                     LUCY
                         Twinkle.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to class)
                         Everyone stop!
                              (to Lucy)
                         Let me hear.

               Lucy hesitates, thinking she's in trouble. She plays a jazz 
               variation of the song. Roberta smiles.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Did someone teach you that?

                                     LUCY
                         No. I made it up.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That's really great, Lucy. I'm proud 
                         of you.

               Lucy beams.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to class)
                         All of you -- try it.

               The class plays Lucy's jazz variation and Naeem happily joins 
               in.

               INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY

               Roberta sits opposite Janet and MRS. LAMB, a white woman in 
               her 30's.

                                     MRS. LAMB
                         You're shouting at them. All the 
                         time.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Not all the time. But if they don't 
                         listen --

                                     MRS. LAMB
                         Didn't you tell them that they were 
                         making their parents sick?

               Janet raises her eyebrows at this.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That wasn't exactly what I said --

                                     MRS. LAMB
                         I'm raising Becky in a supportive 
                         atmosphere. I don't send her to school 
                         to be abused.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm just trying to discipline them. 
                         If they're gonna learn an instrument, 
                         they need to take it seriously --

                                     JANET
                         I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to 
                         say, Roberta, is that you're a little 
                         too harsh. I'm sure you might be 
                         able to soften some of your comments 
                         to the children?

               She gives Roberta a long hard look. Roberta nods.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Roberta listens to the students play "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" -- 
               badly. They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, that was... that was pretty 
                         good... that wasn't too bad...

               They look at her in disbelief, then look at each other.

                                     DE SEAN
                         It wasn't? I thought we stunk.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I wouldn't put it that way... You 
                         all just need to practice a bit more.
                              (to James)
                         James, have you practiced this week?

               The boy nervously shakes his head no.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Can you please try a little harder 
                         for next week?

               James nods. The kids are baffled by her politeness.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Good. Just do the best you can.

                                     DE SEAN
                         Why you acting like that?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Like what?

                                     DE SEAN
                         Nice.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Don't you want a nice teacher?

                                     DE SEAN
                         I already got nice teachers. You 
                         added some variety.

                                     LUCY
                         Yeah. We like you better the way you 
                         used to be.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh.
                              (to Becky)
                         What about you, Becky?

                                     BECKY
                         Yeah. This is even worse. You're 
                         acting weird now.

               A beat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, then -- I take it back. You 
                         all stunk.

               The kids laugh.

                                     ROBERTA
                         But don't tell your parents I said 
                         so!

               The kids laugh again.

               INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATE - DAY

               Christmas MUZAK plays in the b.g. as Roberta kisses and hugs 
               Lexi and Nick goodbye. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT stands nearby.

                                     LEXI
                         Can't you come with us? Please?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Honey, I told you. This is Daddy's 
                         special time with you.

               Lexi looks upset; Nick is stoic. Roberta hugs them one last 
               time. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         I'll take good care of them.

               The FLIGHT ATTENDANT escorts them into the jet way. Roberta 
               holds back tears as they get further away from her. At the 
               last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not. Roberta 
               waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from 
               sight. She observes all the families travelling together, 
               and feels like the loneliest person in the airport.

               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and 
               double-locks the door behind her. You can see on her face 
               that she's dreading the emptiness. She crosses to a small 
               Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and 
               plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly 
               Rockefeller Center. She turns on the T.V., playing IT'S A 
               WONDERFUL LIFE.

               She crosses to the kitchen, then returns with a carton of 
               eggnog, a glass, and a bottle of rum. She sits down on the 
               couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum, 
               goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles 
               some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at 
               the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less 
               festive if she tried. There's a KNOCK on the DOOR.

               Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Who is it?

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         Santa Claus.

               She looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the 
               door and opens it, revealing BRIAN, giving her a big smile.

               He looks sexy as hell (even with a silly lit-up Santa Claus 
               pin on his leather jacket), and he holds a long-stemmed red 
               rose in one hand, and a Christmas present in the other.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm back.

               Roberta's thrilled and relieved to see him. She embraces 
               him, and they kiss passionately.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (TIME CUT - TWO MONTHS LATER)

               CLOSE ON plaster walls being knocked down with sledgehammers. 
               REVEAL Brian, Roberta, and a couple of workmen knocking down 
               the walls in an old brownstone.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - EAST HARLEM - THE SAME DAY

               A mild winter day. Roberta, covered with plaster dust and 
               overheated from working, leans against a car and drinks a 
               beer. The three-story brick building has some graffiti on it 
               and is badly in need of a paint job; there are a few broken 
               windows, and the front stairs need repairing. WORKMEN file 
               in and out. We can see from the STREET SIGNS that we're on 
               118th STREET, a few houses off FIRST AVENUE.

               Brian (also dust-covered), Nick and Lexi toss around a 
               football. LAWRENCE (6), a Black boy who lives next door, 
               joins them. Brian crosses to Roberta, sweaty and out of 
               breath. He takes a swig of her beer.

                                     ROBERTA
                         O.K., enough goofing off -- back to 
                         work.

                                     BRIAN
                         You trying to kill me?

               She laughs and they kiss.

               ASSUNTA comes up the street with a bag of take-out food. She 
               casts a dubious glance at the lovers.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         I was the only person in the whole 
                         coffee shop not speaking Spanish.

               Roberta rolls her eyes. O.S. a car BACKFIRES.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         You hear that? Gunshots! How you 
                         gonna live here by yourself?
                              (calling)
                         Boys, come eat!

                                     ROBERTA
                         I work in this neighborhood, Mama. I 
                         want to live here.

               The boys approach and Assunta hands them sandwiches. Lawrence 
               hangs back. Assunta calls to him.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         What's your name?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Lawrence.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         You hungry, Lawrence?

               Lawrence nods and she hands him a sandwich. Roberta smiles 
               at her mother's gesture. The kids move off to Lawrence's 
               front steps and Assunta gives Roberta and Brian sandwiches.

                                     ASSUNTA
                              (to Brian)
                         Why did you let her buy this house?

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, your daughter does what she 
                         wants -- or haven't you noticed?

                                     ASSUNTA
                         I've noticed.

               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

               Robert washes dishes and Assunta dries. The leftovers from 
               an Italian dinner are on the counter.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         I still don't understand the rush.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Having my own place will make me 
                         feel like I'm really starting my 
                         life again.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         But if you invested your divorce 
                         settlement, you could buy something 
                         nice someday. It's bad enough that 
                         you've been renting in this 
                         neighborhood, but to lock yourself 
                         into a mortgage --

                                     ROBERTA
                              (snapping)
                         Mama, please. Just stop!

               Assunta backs off. Roberta feels guilty and moves to her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Don't worry, O.K.? Besides, if things 
                         keep going well, I'm sure eventually 
                         Brian will move in with us.

               A few beats.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         How much do you know about this man?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Brian's a good person, he's helped 
                         me a lot, he's great with the boys -- 
                         since he got back to town, it's been 
                         really sweet.

                                     ASSUNTA
                              (with an attitude)
                         And how long has he been back?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Two months.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         That's not very long. Don't make the 
                         same mistake twice, Bert. You barely 
                         knew Charles when you married him.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (defensive)
                         I don't get it -- you're ragging on 
                         me about buying the house -- I would 
                         think you'd want Brian to live with 
                         me.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         Not if he's the wrong person.

               Roberta locks her jaw, not wanting to believe that she's 
               right.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               The kids play "Allegro," Roberta leading them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Get ready, now -- we're coming up to 
                         the fermata...

               They reach a certain note, then pause.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Hold... Hold... Don't anybody move. 
                         Now at the Spring Concert, the 
                         audience is gonna be dying for that 
                         next note -- but we'll make them 
                         wait. As a matter of fact, I think 
                         I'll go grab a cup of coffee.

               She starts for the door and the kids moan and groan: "Come 
               on, Roberta!" "Roberta, get back here!" She smiles.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, O.K. But you have to promise 
                         you'll all start together.

               She nods. They begin again -- all at different times.

                                     DE SEAN
                         Man. We'll never get that right.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That's not a very nice thing to say 
                         about your classmates.
                              (to class)
                         How many people think they can get 
                         it right by the concert?

               All the kids raise their hands. De Sean looks around, 
               embarrassed, then raises his too. Roberta smiles.

               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Brian and Roberta finish making love on the futon. They lie 
               in each other's arms, still breathing heavily.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I love you.

               Brian makes a sound that's either panting or laughing.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Did you just laugh?

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm sorry. It's just...

               Roberta looks at him, offended.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?

                                     BRIAN
                         Why do people feel like the minute 
                         something's going great, they gotta 
                         name it?
                              (beat)
                         Once you name something, you snuff 
                         the life out of it.

               She disentangles from him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Jesus, Brian. Do you still get away 
                         with that crap? It's not the Sixties 
                         anymore.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, maybe if you'd actually gone 
                         through the Sixties, you'd know what 
                         I'm talking about.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Fine! We won't name it, we won't 
                         talk about it, we'll act like we 
                         have no feelings for each other 
                         whatsoever!

               She angrily turns on her side with her back to him. Brian 
               regrets hurting her and moves to her, kissing her shoulder.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm sorry. I'm being an asshole.
                              (sweetly teasing)
                         You can say you love me if you want.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Forget it. I changed my mind.

               He laughs and coaxes her to kiss him -- a temporary truce.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

               ERNIE (70's), a rickety Black man in work boots, looks baffled 
               by a tangled mess of wires protruding from a wall. Roberta 
               approaches.

                                     ROBERTA
                         How's it coming, Ernie?

                                     ERNIE
                         Well, if I could just remember what 
                         I did here yesterday, I'd be moving 
                         a whole lot faster.
                              (beat)
                         You look real pretty today, honey.

               Brian overhears, rolls his eyes and pulls her aside.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're crazy. Why did you hire him?

                                     ROBERTA
                         He needed a job. Besides, he's wired 
                         all of East Harlem.

                                     BRIAN
                         When? Fifty years ago?

               Brian sighs and walks off into another room. Two MEN carry 
               in large panels of sheetrock with old WALLPAPER on it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Why is there wallpaper on it?

                                     MAN #1
                         That's how it comes.

               They lean the panels against a wall. Roberta turns to Ernie.

                                     ERNIE
                         Yep, that's how it comes now.

               The guys quickly exit. Brian re-enters and sees the panels.

                                     BRIAN
                         What the hell is this?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Sheetrock.

                                     BRIAN
                         You've gotta be kidding. Those ex-
                         cons you hired ripped this off -- 
                         and you too!

               Roberta feels stupid but doesn't want to show it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Look -- this house is taking every 
                         penny of my settlement. I can't afford 
                         fancy union workers!

                                     BRIAN
                              (throwing up his hands)
                         Fine. Do it your way.

               He stomps off. ANOTHER ANGLE - Nick watches them fight and 
               looks distressed.

               EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

               Lots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a 
               fight in progress. As we move through the crowd we see that 
               NICK's in a fight with another boy; Nick's nose is bleeding 
               and he has the boy in a headlock. TWO TEACHERS run over to 
               break it up.

               INT. AREA OUTSIDE JANET'S OFFICE - DAY

               Nick sits outside, holding an ice pack to his bloody nose.

               INT. JANET'S OFFICE - DAY

               Roberta stands opposite Janet.

                                     JANET
                         I'm giving him a two-day suspension -- 
                         but next time he'll be expelled.

                                     ROBERTA
                         There won't be a next time -- I 
                         promise.

                                     JANET
                         Have you noticed your son lately? 
                         He's tied up in knots and he needs 
                         help.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Janet, kids fight. You're making too 
                         much of this.

                                     JANET
                         He was choking the kid.
                              (beat)
                         Nick's in trouble, Roberta. You need 
                         to deal with it.

               Roberta takes this in, upset.

               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta plays "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" with Guadalupe, De Sean, 
               Naeem, Benjamin, and two kids from the other classes. Lexi 
               plays along with them. Nick enters from the kitchen, eating 
               a cookie, ignoring the students. He turns on the T.V.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to students)
                         Keep playing, guys.

               Roberta crosses to Nick and shuts off the T.V.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You can watch when we're done.

                                     NICK
                         It's my house! They don't live here -- 
                         I do!

                                     ROBERTA
                              (sotto)
                         Nick honey -- the kids are real 
                         nervous about the Spring concert. 
                         You could probably give them some 
                         pointers.

                                     NICK
                         I don't feel like it.

               He reaches for the T.V. dial and she stops him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I said no.

               She crosses back to her students; Nick turns on the T.V.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Brian, Nick and Lexi laugh as they play frisbee alongside a 
               DUCK POND. Roberta watches, relieved to see Nick enjoying 
               himself.

                                     BRIAN
                         Good catch Nick!

               Nick throws it back to Brian and it lands in the WATER.

                                     BRIAN
                              (mock sternly)
                         Uh-oh. You know what that means?

               He stalks towards Nick menacingly, picks him up and pretends 
               he's going to throw him into the water. Nick laughs 
               hysterically.

                                     NICK
                              (through laughter)
                         Don't! Don't throw me in!

                                     BRIAN
                         Whatsa matter? Afraid of a little 
                         water? The ducks aren't afraid! Are 
                         you a chicken or a duck?

                                     NICK
                         Don't! Don't throw me!

                                     BRIAN
                         Looks like you got yourself a chicken, 
                         Roberta!

                                     NICK
                         I'm not a chicken!

                                     BRIAN
                         Well then you must be a duck!

               He pretends again to throw Nick in, then puts him down. Lexi 
               holds out his arms to Brian.

                                     LEXI
                         Throw me in the water, Brian! Do it 
                         to me!

               Brian swoops him up and Lexi starts laughing. Roberta laughs 
               along, happy to see the affection between Brian and her sons.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - A LITTLE LATER

               Brian and Roberta speak as they stroll; the boys run ahead 
               of them, dragging sticks along the pavement. In the b.g. we 
               see HARLEM STREETS bordering the park.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You seem to be the only one who can 
                         get Nick to laugh these days.

                                     BRIAN
                         He misses his dad. I'm just a 
                         surrogate.

                                     ROBERTA
                         No -- I think Nick really likes you.
                              (taking his arm)
                         You know... we're all hoping you'll 
                         move into the new house with us.

                                     BRIAN
                         Whoa. Can we just slow down here a 
                         minute? It's too much like getting 
                         married.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What's so bad about that?

                                     BRIAN
                         That kind of commitment just isn't 
                         realistic. I mean, how can we know 
                         that you and I will even be able to 
                         stand each other in five years?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, we don't. But if two people 
                         care about each other, they take a 
                         chance.

                                     BRIAN
                         And look what happened to you and 
                         Charles.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm not talking about Charles. I'm 
                         talking about us.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on 
                         a belief that one person can 
                         completely meet another person's 
                         needs. I just don't buy that.

               This is making her nervous. She looks at him, afraid of what 
               he might be saying.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (carefully)
                         What are you saying? If there's some 
                         need you have that I don't meet, 
                         you'd go and get it "met" by someone 
                         else?

               He heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the 
               question.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm saying that it's the 80's and 
                         it's a fantasy to think of marriage 
                         lasting these days. One out of two 
                         marriages ends in divorce!

                                     ROBERTA
                         You didn't answer my question.
                              (beat)
                         If I don't meet all your needs, and 
                         we're in a committed relationship -- 
                         forget marriage for a minute; I'm 
                         just talking about a relationship -- 
                         would you go to someone else?

               A beat.

                                     BRIAN
                         In theory, yes.

                                     ROBERTA
                         In theory.

               Roberta looks very disheartened. Brian feels badly.

                                     BRIAN
                         Roberta, we've got something good 
                         right now -- that's the important 
                         thing. Let's just keep it that way, 
                         O.K.?

               He pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away 
               from him. ON NICK, observing with an anxious expression.

               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                     NICK (O.S.)
                              (whining)
                         Why can't he?

               Roberta looks distressed by her talk with Brian as she and 
               the boys enter, back from the park.

                                     ROBERTA
                         He just can't, O.K.? Brian's at his 
                         house tonight, and we're at ours.

                                     NICK
                         Well then I wanna go to his house.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Enough, Nick. Now why don't you and 
                         your brother practice while I make 
                         dinner.

                                     NICK
                         I don't feel like practicing.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well do it anyway.

                                     NICK
                         I wanna go to Brian's!

                                     ROBERTA
                         Stop whining, and get your violin.

               Nick stomps off to get his violin. Lexi follows. Roberta 
               puts down her bag and takes off her coat. While Lexi sets up 
               his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin 
               and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                     NICK
                         The problem with you is you're mean 
                         to everybody and then they don't 
                         want to be with you!

                                     ROBERTA
                         I've heard just about enough from 
                         you, young man. Now set your violin 
                         up properly and start practicing.

               Nick THROWS the violin against the floor. Roberta's 
               speechless.

                                     NICK
                         I hate the violin!

                                     ROBERTA
                         You pick that violin up right now 
                         and don't you ever ever --

               Nick picks up the violin and THROWS the violin down even 
               harder, then YELLS at Roberta before she can even respond.

                                     NICK
                         It's all your fault! You made Daddy 
                         leave and you're gonna make Brian 
                         leave too! You're gonna be all alone 
                         and I'll have to take care of you!

               Roberta is stunned. The anger drains out of her as she 
               suddenly sees what this is all about.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Nick -- you don't have to take care 
                         of me.

                                     NICK
                         Then who's going to?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'll take care of myself -- and I'll 
                         take care of you and Lexi. I promise.

                                     NICK
                         You didn't try hard enough. You made 
                         Daddy leave us.

               This hits her in the solar plexus. Her hurt and vulnerability 
               start to pour out.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That's not true. I begged him not to 
                         leave, but he didn't listen.

                                     NICK
                         Why not?

               Roberta hesitates, but knows she has to tell them the truth. 
               She addresses both boys.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Your father met someone he liked 
                         more than Mommy, and then --

                                     NICK
                         Who?

               Roberta swallows, shocked to hear him ask this. She can hardly 
               answer him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Lana. Remember our friends Lana and 
                         Tom?

                                     NICK
                         Is he gonna marry her now?

                                     ROBERTA
                         No, but he's not coming back... to 
                         me.

               Nick and Lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the 
               finality in her words, but from seeing their mother's pain. 
               Roberta moves closer to them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'll take care of you, Nick. You 
                         too, Lexi. I promise. I'm not going 
                         anywhere. We're still a family.

               Nick starts crying. Roberta takes him in her arms. Lexi starts 
               to cry and Roberta holds him too.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (softly, to both)
                         I promise.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

               Ernie's radio plays a BLUES SONG. The BRICK WORKERS radio 
               plays SPANISH MUSIC, and the PAINTERS' radio plays a RAP 
               SONG. Roberta stands in the middle, about to lose her mind.

               HER POV - Ernie sits on a stool facing his wiring. He's fast 
               asleep. ANOTHER ANGLE - The brick workers build a crooked 
               fireplace.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Roberta sighs heavily, then crosses to the painters.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What color is this?

                                     PAINTER
                         White.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I told you Eggshell.

                                     PAINTER
                         Eggshells are white.

               Brian watches this interaction as he sands a door.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're an idiot! I told you -- you 
                         can't be your own contractor.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You're right. I'm an idiot.

               She crosses to Ernie and shakes him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Wake up, Ernie.

               He looks at her groggily.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You're fired.

               She crosses to the brick workers.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You're fired.

               She crosses to the painters.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You're fired.

               Brian smiles at her, impressed.

                                     BRIAN
                         That's more like it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You're fired too.

               Brian laughs.

                                     ROBERTA
                         No, Brian. I mean it. I need to be 
                         with a man who can make a commitment 
                         to me. I need that, and my sons need 
                         that.
                              (beat)
                         So can you?

                                     BRIAN
                              (hesitates, then)
                         Roberta --

               His tone and expression tell her the words are not 
               forthcoming.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Get out.

               He looks at her, shocked by her toughness, but knows he can't 
               give her what she wants. He exits. Roberta stands in the 
               middle of the room, a determined look on her face.

               INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               ROBERTA

               Stands in the aisle, leading the students and playing violin.

               ON STAGE

               The fifty fifth-grade students play the "Twinkle" variations. 
               Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific.

               As the CAMERA PANS the audience, we recognize: MRS. ADISA, 
               tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem; MRS. LAMB and her 
               husband, watching Becky in amazement; ISABEL and her daughter 
               sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as 
               hell; and DENNIS, seething with jealousy. As the kids start 
               the jazz variation of "Twinkle," a WOMAN elbows her husband:

                                     WOMAN
                         That's the one Lucy wrote!

               The CAMERA returns to the children and captures their own 
               pride in their playing, including LUCY, who smiles as she 
               hears her song played by fifty.

               THE CONCERT - TIME DISSOLVE

               The students are now playing "Allegro," and they reach the 
               fermata. They hold their positions in silence and the audience 
               watches in anticipation. Roberta cues them and they play the 
               next note in perfect unison. An involuntary smile lights on 
               DE SEAN's face. They finish the song, the audience applauds, 
               and Roberta turns to face them.

               She lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and 
               Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CPE 1 - DAY - ESTABLISHING - TIME CUT (1998)

               The side of the building now has an impressive mural: an 
               urban landscape with three super heroes -- Puerto Rican, 
               Black, and white -- rising up out of the street. It reads 
               ONLY THE STRONG SHALL SURVIVE.

               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

               Roberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first-
               graders -- mostly Black and Latino, a few white -- sitting 
               on the floor, chatting excitedly. Even though Roberta's ten 
               years older, she seems more youthful; her wavy hair is loose 
               over her shoulders, her clothing's casual and artistic. Beside 
               her is Janet, her hair flecked with gray, and Dennis, who 
               looks pretty much the same. The classroom teacher is ISABEL, 
               a little older, a little tougher.

                                     ISABEL
                         C'mon everybody, settle down -- Janet 
                         wants to talk to you.

                                     JANET
                         Today's a very special day because 
                         we're starting the tenth year of the 
                         East Harlem Violin Program. This is 
                         a wonderful opportunity for you, so 
                         I want you to talk to your parents 
                         about whether you'd like to try this.

                                     ISABEL
                         My daughter took violin with Roberta 
                         when she was your age, and now she's 
                         in high school and she still talks 
                         about how much she loved it.

                                     DENNIS
                         Janet and I started this program 
                         because we knew how much you kids 
                         could benefit from it.

               CUTAWAY to Roberta and Janet exchanging glances over Dennis 
               taking credit for the program.

                                     DENNIS
                         You should know, however, that the 
                         violin is a difficult instrument.

               JUSTIN, a Black boy with attitude, raises his hand. He always 
               wears a puffy red, yellow and green crocheted beret. Isabel 
               nods to him.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Who's that lady in the back?

               ANGLE - DOROTHEA (Doro-taya) VAN HAUFTEN (40's), an elegant, 
               beautiful woman, smartly dressed, takes photographs from the 
               back of the room.

                                     JANET
                         That's Dorothea Van Hauften --

                                     JUSTIN
                         Say what? What kinda name is that?

                                     ISABEL
                         Justin -- sshh!

                                     JANET
                         -- and she's taking pictures of 
                         Roberta's classes for a magazine 
                         article about music education.

                                     JUSTIN
                         I wanna be in the magazine!

                                     ISABEL
                         First things first, Justin. Roberta's 
                         gonna explain to you about the 
                         "lottery."

               Roberta steps forward. RAMON OLIVAS (7), a small, adorable 
               Puerto Rican boy with a crew cut, watches her with adoration.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I used to just teach fifty kids at 
                         this school. But now I teach a hundred 
                         and fifty kids at three East Harlem 
                         schools and there's so many children 
                         who want to take violin classes that 
                         we have to have a lottery.

               VANESSA raises her hand, a white girl whose clothes and 
               accessories are always adorned with cats.

                                     VANESSA
                         Can I be in the class?

                                     ISABEL
                         Roberta's explaining that. Just 
                         listen.

                                     ROBERTA
                         After your parents sign your 
                         permission slips, I'm gonna put them 
                         in a sack, and I'll pick fifty names 
                         from each school.

               ANGLE - Ramon listens intently with his fingers crossed.

                                     ROBERTA
                         So everyone bring in your slips by 
                         Friday, and I'll come back and tell 
                         you who's in violin class.

                                     ISABEL
                         Remember, she's just picking names 
                         from a hat. It doesn't mean that 
                         anyone's better than anyone else.

               RAMON raises his hand.

                                     RAMON
                              (to Roberta)
                         I really really hope that I get in 
                         the class.

               Roberta looks at him, struck by his sweetness.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I hope so too.

               EXT. 118TH STREET - STREET SIGN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

               EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

               The brownstone looks a lot better than when we last saw it. 
               Graffiti's been removed, the stairs have been repaired, the 
               windows have security bars, and there are flowers blooming 
               in pots in front of the building. Roberta steps INTO FRAME, 
               walking Allegra, now a 10-year-old dog.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

               The house is transformed: the first floor is one long open 
               room with oak floors, a living room in front with a beautiful 
               fireplace and a grand piano, and a country kitchen in the 
               rear, complete with pots hanging over a large butcher block.

               NICK (17) practices cello and LEXI (15) practices piano; 
               they play Haydn's "Trio #13." Now handsome young men, their 
               blonde hair has darkened to brown. Nick is huskier; Lexi has 
               a slighter build. Both are passionate, talented musicians.

               On the couch, RACHEL (12), a mature, beautiful Black girl, 
               rosins her bow.

                                     RACHEL
                         How come you guys don't play the 
                         violin?

                                     LEXI
                         Well, picture her being your teacher 
                         and your mother.

               Rachel cracks up but stifles her laughter as Roberta enters 
               from outside with Allegra.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Hi Rachel. Be right with you.

               As Roberta removes Allegra's leash, Rachel and Lexi share a 
               conspiratorial look. In the b.g., Nick packs up his cello.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to Nick)
                         You're gonna practice upstairs?

                                     NICK
                         No. I'm done.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Already? You've barely practiced.

                                     NICK
                         What -- are you timing me with a 
                         stop watch? Why don't you pick on 
                         Lexi for a change?

                                     LEXI
                         'Cause I'm perfect.

               Nick jostles him and heads upstairs. Lexi gets up from the 
               piano.

                                     LEXI
                              (to Rachel)
                         Have a good lesson.

               He crosses to a sharp-looking bike parked behind the front 
               door and addresses Roberta.

                                     LEXI
                         I'll be back in a couple of hours.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Be careful.

               Lexi mouths "be careful" along with her.

               EXT. RIVER EAST PARK - DUSK

               Lexi plays basketball with a group of Black and Latino guys. 
               Despite his small stature, he's a great athlete, and an 
               accepted part of the group. The game ends. He and his buddy 
               Lawrence (now 16), both all sweaty, cross to a water fountain. 
               As Lexi takes a drink --

                                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Can I try your bike?

               Lexi wipes his mouth and looks up at HENRY (18), a tall, 
               intimidating Black teenager who towers over him. Lawrence 
               watches tensely.

                                     LEXI
                         I'm gonna be leaving pretty soon.

                                     HENRY
                         Just wanna take it for a spin.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         C'mon, Henry -- he don't want to 
                         loan you his bike.

                                     HENRY
                         I didn't hear him say that.
                              (to Lexi)
                         Is that true? Did you say that?

               Lexi looks at him, knowing there's only one right answer.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Roberta and Rachel play Bach's "Minuet One" together on the 
               violin. The girl has obvious talent.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Vibrato... don't wiggle your wrist.

               Rachel stops, frustrated.

                                     RACHEL
                         Dang! I can't get that right.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You almost have it.

                                     RACHEL
                         Almost isn't good enough.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Did I turn you into such a 
                         perfectionist?

                                     RACHEL
                         No. I came that way.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (smiles, then)
                         Just as long as you get it right for 
                         your Julliard audition.

                                     RACHEL
                         What?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I've recommended you for a gifted 
                         kids scholarship.

               Rachel looks at her in wide-eyed gratitude.

               ANGLE - Lexi enters the front door, a glum look on his face.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where's the bike?

               INT. HONDA/EXT. EAST HARLEM STREETS - NIGHT

               Roberta drives with Nick in the front, Lexi and Lawrence in 
               the back. They're in a dangerous looking part of East Harlem.

                                     LEXI
                         Mom, please. Don't do this to me!

                                     NICK
                         C'mon, Mom -- why don't you let me 
                         handle this?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Are we getting closer, Lawrence?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         It's the next block up.

                                     LEXI
                              (to Roberta)
                         You don't have to do this. I'll pay 
                         you back.

                                     ROBERTA
                         How? It took me six months to save 
                         up for it.

                                     NICK
                         I'll help him, O.K.? We'll both pay 
                         you back.

                                     LEXI
                         Or we'll ask Dad -- he'll help us 
                         out.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yeah, right.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         O.K., slow down. It's the second one 
                         on the right.

               Roberta slows the car down next to a HOUSING PROJECT.

               EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - NIGHT

               Not a place you'd want to go into, even in the day time.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is their POV from INSIDE THE CAR. 
               The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.

                                     NICK
                         C'mon Mom, let's get out of here.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Lock the doors.

               And she exits. The boys watch as she heads for the building, 
               then Lexi shakes his head and covers his face.

                                     LEXI
                         I'm dead. She's gonna get me killed.

               Nick jumps out of the car and heads after her.

                                     NICK
                         I'm coming with you!

                                     ROBERTA
                         No. Get back in the car and stay 
                         with the boys.

               Nick hesitates and heads back. Roberta presses on. Lawrence 
               opens the window and calls to her.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Don't take the stairs!

               INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON THE ELEVATOR DOOR with a handwritten SIGN that reads 
               OUT OF ORDER.

               WIDER - Roberta stands in front of the elevator, staring 
               tensely at the sign. She takes a deep breath, then heads for 
               the staircase.

               INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary 
               building. O.S. a BABY CRIES, a couple of TV's BLARE.

               INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               At the top of the stairs, Roberta turns down the hall, passing 
               a door riddled with bullet holes. She finds the apartment 
               and knocks. No response. She knocks again.

                                     OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Yeah?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm a school teacher. Henry has taken 
                         my son's bicycle and I want it back.

               A beat, then the door cracks open, an OLD WOMAN visible 
               through the chain lock.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Henry's not here.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well you tell Henry that if he returns 
                         the bike, I won't have to notify the 
                         police -- or his school principal. 
                         Although since I am a teacher, it 
                         would be very easy for me to do that.

               A couple of beats.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         He's not home. He doesn't get home 
                         till late.

                                     ROBERTA
                         How late?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Not till after ten.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'll be on the steps of CPE 1 at 11 
                         P.M. I'll be waiting for him.

               The door closes. Roberta exhales. Did she just do that?

               EXT. CPE 1 - NIGHT

               Roberta, Nick, Lexi and Lawrence sit on the front steps of 
               the school. The street is deserted.

                                     LEXI
                         You're crazy. He's not gonna show.

               Roberta sits confidently.

                                     NICK
                         You think he actually cares that 
                         you're a teacher? You think he even 
                         goes to school?

                                     LEXI
                         C'mon, Mom -- let's just go.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It's only five after eleven.

               Nick and Lexi roll their eyes and exchange a look: she's 
               nuts. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle. Nick, Lexi 
               and Lawrence look towards the sound, incredulous. Lexi stands.

               Henry rides up on the bike and dismounts. Lexi looks directly 
               at him as he takes the bike from him.

                                     HENRY
                         I was just borrowing it.

               He glances at Roberta, then walks off.

               INT. CPE 1 - CLASSROOM - DAY

               Roberta stands in front of Isabel's class and calls out names, 
               handing the selected children acceptance letters. The kids 
               are charged up; "My heart is pounding!" "Please pick me!"

                                     ROBERTA
                         Shandra Wilson.

               A pretty Black girl with braids and tons of barrettes jumps 
               up and down, then runs up for her letter. The kids SQUEAL 
               and CHEER for each student called. Shandra hugs her best 
               friend MYESHA, a chubby Black girl who also holds a letter.

               JUSTIN raises his fists in triumph. ANGLE - RAMON anxiously 
               waits to see if his name will be called. JUSTIN sits down 
               next to him, waves his letter in Ramon's face, taunting him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Vanessa Klein.

               Vanessa takes her letter and smiles. She puts it into her 
               cat-shaped backpack.

                                     ROBERTA
                         O.K. One more name...

               Ramon crosses his fingers and holds his breath.

                         Leonard Hood.

               RAMON looks crushed. JUSTIN taunts him some more. LEONARD, a 
               scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it. He starts 
               to cry.

                                     LEONARD
                         It's too hard! I don't wanna do it!

                                     ISABEL
                         Don't you even wanna try, Leonard?

                                     LEONARD
                              (through tears)
                         I don't want to!

               Isabel looks at Roberta.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, O.K. then. I'll pick someone 
                         else.
                              (she picks a name)
                         Ramon Olivas.

               Ramon's face lights up.

               EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

               As Roberta walks through the yard, she sees kids excitedly 
               showing acceptance letters to their moms.

               SHANDRA and MYESHA hold hands as they run to Shandra's mom, 
               BEVERLY WILSON, pushing a stroller. She looks at the letter 
               and hugs Shandra.

               ANGLE - RAMON reads his letter to his mother, CONCEPCION 
               (45), whose eyes tell you that she's lived through a lot. 
               She speaks with a Puerto Rican accent.

                                     RAMON
                         This is to inform you that your child, 
                         Ramon Olivas, has been chosen by 
                         lottery to be in the violin program.

                                     CONCEPCION
                         You happy?

               Ramon spins round and round with the letter in his hand.

                                     CONCEPCION
                         I think you're happy.

               EXT. RIVER EAST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

               Roberta illegally parks her old Honda, rushes out of the 
               car, grabs her book bags and three violins, pulls a parking 
               ticket from her pocket and puts it on the windshield.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                              (German accent)
                         Does that really work?

               Roberta turns. It's DOROTHEA, the PHOTOGRAPHER we saw in the 
               classroom.

                                     ROBERTA
                         No. But I keep trying. And maybe 
                         someday the school will give me a 
                         parking space!

               She rushes towards the school and Dorothea follows her.

                                     DOROTHEA
                         Wait --

               She hands Roberta a thin box. Roberta puts down her violins, 
               glances inside it and forgets about being late.

               INSERT

               -- Terrific black and white shots of Roberta's advanced 
               classes playing violin.

                                     ROBERTA (O.S.)
                         God, these are great.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     DOROTHEA
                         Those copies are for you.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Thank you. Can I... pay for you them?

                                     DOROTHEA
                         Don't be silly. Besides -- you'll 
                         need your money for parking tickets.

               They smile at each other.

                                     DOROTHEA
                         What you're doing for these children 
                         is wonderful. My husband's a violinist -- 
                         he was quite impressed when I told 
                         him about you.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What's his name?

                                     DOROTHEA
                         Arnold Steinhardt.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Of the Guarneri String Quartet?

               Dorothea nods, and hands Roberta a card.

                                     DOROTHEA
                         Stay in touch. Let us know when the 
                         kids have a concert.

               RACHEL, heading for school, calls out to Roberta.

                                     RACHEL
                         Don't be late for violin class! I 
                         hear the teacher's really mean.

               Roberta smiles, slips the card in her pocket, nods to Dorothea 
               and follows Rachel.

               INT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Roberta's advanced class plays "Can-Can." Rachel's one of 
               the eight sixth-graders. Roberta plays along, crossing to 
               AMANDA, a white girl in a country-western outfit.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Amanda, what did I tell you about 
                         wearing cowboy boots to violin class? 
                         They're too slippery!

               She crosses to a pudgy Black/Puerto Rican boy with glasses.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Relax your two, Simon...

               She glances at STEPHANIE, a white girl with red hair, next 
               to KENNY, a Black boy with an earnest expression.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Your stop sign has to be up, Kenny! 
                         Stephanie, it doesn't look like you 
                         ever had a lesson with me!

               CARLOS (13) hurries in, a handsome Black boy in a baseball 
               jacket that says "LOS LEONES." He looks 15.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where's your violin, Carlos?

                                     CARLOS
                         It's coming.

               He nervously looks down the hall.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What, is it walking here by itself?

               A Black third-grade girl rushes into the room and hands Carlos 
               his violin, then runs off. Roberta crosses to Carlos as he 
               quickly readies the violin.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Your buddies giving you a hard time?

                                     CARLOS
                         Look, it's just not cool. You wouldn't 
                         understand.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Hey, you want your sister to carry 
                         your violin, that's fine. But is she 
                         practicing for you too? Because 
                         lately, that's how it sounds.

                                     CARLOS
                         I've been busy! I've been --

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm not interested! Just get here on 
                         time, and commit to this class or I 
                         don't want you in here, you 
                         understand?

               He nods sullenly.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You're a good violinist, Carlos -- 
                         and it's definitely not "cool" to 
                         waste your own talent.

               Carlos takes this in as Roberta crosses to another student.

               EXT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - EAST HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

               It's upstairs from a grocery store on a busy street.

               INT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Ramon sits on the floor, upset, half-heartedly building with 
               Legos, while his parents argue in the KITCHEN. His father 
               MANUELO is a stocky, muscular man. INTERCUT between the two 
               areas. This is a modest, well-kept apartment. Off the kitchen, 
               religious candles burn on a shelf above a washing machine.

                                     MANUELO
                         Why didn't you show it to me?

                                     CONCEPCION
                         It just needed one parent's signature.

                              (with some Spanish)
                         Well, I'm his parent and I don't 
                         give permission! He should be playing 
                         baseball, not the violin!

                                     CONCEPCION
                         It makes him happy.

               ON RAMON, looking far from happy at the moment.

               EXT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - DAY

               Rachel steps off a city bus, carrying her violin. She passes 
               two sixth-grade boys and a girl.

                                     BOY #1
                              (loudly)
                         Ooh, check out little Miss Violinhead.

                                     GIRL
                         She carry that violin with her all 
                         the time 'cause she think she special.

               Rachel turns to them.

                                     RACHEL
                         I am special.

               She proudly continues on, then sees Roberta walking towards 
               the school and catches up to her.

                                     RACHEL
                              (nonchalant)
                         So I heard from Julliard.

               Roberta stops and looks at her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And?

                                     RACHEL
                         They said yes!

               Roberta gives her a big hug.

               INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               ON THE BEGINNER'S CLASS, including Ramon, as they play 
               "Lightly Row." Roberta walks around, making corrections as 
               she addresses the students. She doesn't see Justin poking 
               Ramon with his bow; Ramon swats the bow away and glares at 
               his nemesis. Roberta moves some of Shandra's braids away 
               from the violin.

                                     ROBERTA
                         So when you take the violins home, 
                         tape your music to the wall directly 
                         in front of your nose so you can 
                         play with perfect posture. Your 
                         parents are gonna be so excited to 
                         hear you play!

               INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               SCREECHING comes from Ramon's room as he practices "Lightly 
               Row." His brothers, PEDRO (18) and ERNESTO (17), cringe as 
               they try to watch T.V. Ernesto gives up and puts on his 
               Walkman; Pedro's ready to break the violin. Concepcion listens 
               patiently as she folds laundry, but even she winces.

                                     PEDRO
                              (yelling)
                         Ramon! How many cats you killing in 
                         there?

               INTERCUT RAMON - He plays with pride, eyes on the music taped 
               to the wall.

               INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY (A FEW MONTHS LATER)

               ON RAMON, his improved playing showing that time has passed. 
               WIDER - the beginner's class plays "Lightly Row."

               JUSTIN is struggling more than the other students. Roberta 
               plays along with the class, eyeing each student.

                                     ROBERTA
                         More bow! To the frog! Myesha, your 
                         stop sign line should be touching. 
                         Don't let it wiggle! You're on the 
                         wrong string, Justin! And look at 
                         your feet!

               Vanessa enters the front door without her violin.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where's your violin?

                                     VANESSA
                         I forgot.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Goodbye! And you may be dropped.

               Vanessa pouts and exits. Roberta moves to ROSARIO, a Puerto 
               Rican girl.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Look at those nails, Rosario!

               She pulls a clipper from her pocket and swiftly clips them. 
               MYESHA nervously glances at her own nails.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I see you over there, Myesha.

               She moves to Ramon and corrects his bowing position.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to Ramon)
                         You're doing much better.

               As Roberta walks on to the next student, Justin purposely 
               knocks over Ramon's music stand.

                                     RAMON
                         Drop dead, Justin!

                                     JUSTIN
                         It was a accident!

                                     RAMON
                         Was not!

                                     ROBERTA
                         Ramon, I don't like that kind of 
                         talk. Justin, pick up his stand, 
                         now! Our spring concert is in three 
                         weeks and you might not be in it. Is 
                         that what you want?

               EXT. CPE 1 - DAY

               As Roberta heads for her car, she sees Vanessa being helped 
               into a car by her FATHER, his suit wrinkled and tie loosened. 
               There's SNOW on the ground.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Mr. Klein? I'm gonna have to drop 
                         Vanessa from the class if she keeps 
                         forgetting her violin.

                                     MR. KLEIN
                              (sotto)
                         She's going back and forth between 
                         houses. My wife and I split up.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (softening)
                         Oh. I'm sorry.

               Roberta leans into the car window.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Vanessa, maybe you could write down 
                         for your Mom and Dad which days are 
                         violin days.

                                     VANESSA
                              (almost in tears)
                         The tape doesn't stick.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?

                                     VANESSA
                         I taped the music to the wall at my 
                         Mom's house and then I took it to my 
                         Dad's house and it doesn't stick 
                         anymore.

               Mr. Klein's eyes tear up and he quickly wipes them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well you know what? That's an easy 
                         problem to solve.

               She looks through her book bag, takes out a piece of music 
               and gives it to her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Now you have two, O.K.? One for each 
                         house.

               Vanessa nods, clutching the piece of music. Roberta and Mr. 
               Klein exchange a look. She touches his arm, then walks off.

               INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ramon, holding his bow and violin, crosses to his father 
               who's watching a baseball game on T.V.

                                     RAMON
                         You wanna hear my new song, Papa?

                                     MANUELO
                              (in Spanish)
                         Not right now.

               Ramon exits, hurt. Concepcion watches from the side, and 
               crosses to her husband.

                                     CONCEPCION
                         We made mistakes with Pedro and 
                         Ernesto and we can't fix them now, 
                         but Ramon -- he works so hard. The 
                         violin makes him want to be good at 
                         everything.

               He shows no response, and she exits. Manuelo ponders what 
               she said.

               EXT. CPE 1 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY (MORNING)

               Roberta approaches the school on a winter morning. She smiles 
               as she sees Vanessa get out of her MOTHER'S car with her 
               violin. Roberta nears the front door and finds Isabel and 
               some teachers huddled in conversation. A few students are 
               crying.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to Isabel)
                         What happened?

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               The beginners sit on the floor and rosin their bows. A few 
               chat, but it's quieter than usual, except for RAMON who is 
               "blessing" kids with his violin bow.

                                     RAMON
                         You go to heaven... You go to hell... 
                         You go to hell... heaven...

               Roberta enters slowly. She looks very shaken up. She takes 
               note of what Ramon is doing, and overhears Toussaint and 
               Shandra in mid-conversation.

                                     TOUSSAINT
                         My grandpa died and my uncle, so 
                         that makes six.

                                     SHANDRA
                         I know more than that. At least seven 
                         people... maybe even nine.

               Roberta gently tells Ramon to sit, and then she sits down on 
               a child-sized chair in front of them.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (quietly)
                         I know that you've all heard the bad 
                         news about Justin.

                                     MYESHA
                         I didn't hear.

                                     TOUSSAINT
                         There was a drive-by shooting by his 
                         house and he got shot on accident 
                         and he died.

               Myesha takes this in, looking sad.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Does anyone want to talk about it?

                                     RAMON
                              (angry)
                         I think we should just play violin.

               Roberta watches him.

               INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN AREA - DAY

               Concepcion cooks chicken and Pedro sets the table, whistling 
               along to Ramon's O.S. violin playing "We Shall Overcome." 
               There's a KNOCK on the door. Concepcion answers it, revealing 
               Roberta.

                                     CONCEPCION
                         Roberta! Come in.

               Roberta enters.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I came by to check on Ramon.

                                     CONCEPCION
                              (confused)
                         Why?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Didn't he tell you what happened at 
                         school?

               Concepcion shakes her head no.

               INT. RAMON'S ROOM - DAY

               Ramon is still playing violin as Concepcion and Roberta enter. 
               When he sees Roberta he straightens up even more.

                                     CONCEPCION
                         Roberta wants to talk to you, O.K.?

               He nods. Concepcion touches his head, then exits.

                                     RAMON
                         Did that sound O.K.?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yeah, it did.

               Ramon smiles, pleased with himself.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I've been thinking about Justin. 
                         Remember how mad I got the last time 
                         I saw him?

                                     RAMON
                         Yeah. You got very strict with him.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It wasn't always so easy to be nice 
                         to him, you know?

               Ramon looks away from her, upset.

                                     RAMON
                         You think Justin's in heaven or hell?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Heaven.

               Ramon runs his fingers along his bow.

                                     RAMON
                         I told him to drop dead.

               Roberta touches Ramon's back.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Justin didn't die because of what 
                         you said. I promise.

                                     RAMON
                         How do you know?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I don't think you're that powerful, 
                         do you? I mean, if you had such 
                         powers, just imagine what kind of 
                         violin player you'd be by now!

                                     RAMON
                         Yeah. I'd be better than you!

               They laugh together, then Ramon looks sad again.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It's O.K. to cry, you know.

                                     RAMON
                         Not for a man.

                                     ROBERTA
                         My boys still cry and they're big, 
                         strong young men now.
                              (beat)
                         I bet Justin's daddy cried.

               Ramon's eyes get teary. Roberta quietly leaves the room.

               EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - ESTABLISHING - DAY (SPRING)

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Roberta brings in the mail, looking curiously at a manila 
               envelope with a return address from the NY REVIEW OF BOOKS. 
               She opens it, looks inside, then pours out a batch of other 
               letters onto the table. They're addressed to BOX HOLDER 127. 
               She opens one, reads it, then rushes to an INTERCOM.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Nick, Lexi! Get down here right now!

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - MOMENTS LATER

                                     NICK
                         We were just trying to help!

               Nick and Lexi stand by the table, opposite Roberta -- with 
               the incriminating pile of letters between them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         This is humiliating!

                                     NICK
                         Mom, no one knows it's you! I mean, 
                         you don't even have to read them if 
                         you don't want to.
                              (glances at pile)
                         Although obviously, a lot of guys 
                         are interested in dating you.

                                     ROBERTA
                         No. A lot of guys are interested in 
                         dating you and Lexi.
                              (beat)
                         What did you say about me, anyway?

               They thought she'd never ask.

               They beam with pride. Roberta looks at them, mortified.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh, my God.

                         Don't you think it's a little weird 
                         that you're trying to get your mother 
                         a date?

                         that you're not even interested in 
                         dating?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Boys, look. Number one -- even if I 
                         wanted to date, I don't have time. 
                         And number two -- I've got my 
                         teaching, I've got you guys -- that's 
                         all I need.

               The boys nod, disappointed, and she exits. They look at each 
               other with glum expressions.

                         I really thought she'd like the music 
                         metaphors.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta lies on the couch, reading the personal ad letters. 
               She tosses one aside, then opens another.

               INSERT

               The letter is designed like a newspaper with a headline that 
               reads: JOURNALISM PROFESSOR DAN PAXTON ANSWERS PERSONAL AD; 
               HOPES RUN HIGH BEAUTIFUL MUSICIAN WILL CALL FOR A DATE!

               BACK TO SCENE

               Roberta can't help but be charmed.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta, Nick and Lexi play Haydn's "Trio #13" together on 
               their respective instruments. We sense that this is a special 
               family ritual. They play throughout their conversation:

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think you're flat, Nick.

                                     NICK
                         I'm not flat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         The B sounded flat.

                                     NICK
                         Just play the violin, Mom. I'll take 
                         care of the cello.

               They play for a few beats.

                                     LEXI
                         You nervous, Mom?

                                     ROBERTA
                         No. I'm fine.

               The DOORBELL rings and Roberta jumps up, bolting into the 
               bathroom down the hall.

               Lexi and Nick exchange a smile, then Lexi crosses to the 
               door and opens it.

               INT. DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Standing in the doorway is a man in casual college professor 
               attire. He's nice-looking, but no Prince Charming. He shakes 
               Lexi's hand and smiles warmly.

                                     DAN
                         Hi. I'm Dan Paxton.

               Lexi shows him in.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

               IN THE MIRROR - Roberta takes a last look at herself, 
               wondering if he'll find her attractive. She touches her hair, 
               adjusts her dress, then takes a deep breath as she builds up 
               her courage.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Roberta enters the living room where Dan is chatting with 
               Nick and Lexi. Dan sees her and is instantly smitten.

                                     DAN
                              (shaking her hand)
                         Wow. An honest woman.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Honest?

                                     DAN
                         Your ad. When you said you were 
                         beautiful, you were telling the truth.

               She smiles, blushing, and avoids eye contact with her sons 
               who are trying really hard not to laugh. As she and Dan start 
               to exit:

                                     NICK
                         Make sure you're home by midnight, 
                         young lady.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON CLOCK

               It reads 12:30.

               WIDER - Nick and Lexi play a video game on the TV screen. 
               O.S., there's the SOUND OF A CAR. They race to the window.

                                     LEXI
                         Ten bucks he tries to kiss her.

                                     NICK
                         That's a no-brainer. Of course he'll 
                         try. The real question is whether 
                         she'll let him.

                                     LEXI
                         O.K. -- ten bucks she lets him.

                                     NICK
                         You're on.

               They stare out the window intently.

               INT. DAN'S CAR - NIGHT

               Dan pulls his car up in front of Roberta's house. Beside 
               him, Roberta holds a program from a Lincoln Center concert. 
               Roberta's tense, but Dan seems relaxed and centered in his 
               attraction to her.

                                     DAN
                         I had a lot of fun tonight.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yeah, I did too.

                                     DAN
                         I have a confession -- I've never 
                         answered an ad before. I did it on a 
                         dare.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, I have a confession -- my boys 
                         placed the ad behind my back.

               They both laugh, then smile at each other. An awkward beat: 
               will he or won't he? Dan leans in to kiss her, and Roberta 
               turns away, uncertain.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Look, Dan -- I went along with this 
                         'cause it's been a while. Quite a 
                         while... And I had a very nice time... 
                         but I'm not sure if I'm ready to get 
                         involved with anyone right now.

               A beat. Roberta feels badly about rejecting him.

                                     DAN
                              (deadpan)
                         Does this mean I don't get any 
                         lasagna?

               Roberta cracks up. Dan smiles at her.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Roberta enters. The boys are back to their video game, 
               covering that they've been spying on her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Why are you guys still up?

                         Well... he's nice.

                                     NICK
                         "Nice"? As in "let's just be friends" 
                         nice?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I don't know yet. We'll see.

               Nick looks disappointed.

                                     NICK
                         There's still a lot more letters.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Good night, Nick.

               She starts heading upstairs.

                         Hey, Mom -- can you loan me ten

               INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               THE BLACKBOARD reads: SPRING CONCERT IN 10 DAYS! PRACTICE 
               PRACTICE PRACTICE!

               Roberta rushes in, frazzled, not noticing at first that the 
               beginners are very quiet -- and that most don't have violins.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Guys, I'm so sorry -- I got stuck 
                         over at CPE 2...

               She puts her stuff down, then looks at the kids.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What's going on? Where are all your 
                         violins?

                                     RAMON
                         We heard you got fired.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?!

               EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

               Janet and Dennis talk outside Janet's office. Roberta storms 
               over to them. Janet looks at her, alarmed.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Is it true?

                                     JANET
                         Why don't you come in my office?

                                     ROBERTA
                         It's true? You're firing me?

                                     JANET
                         It's not me, Roberta. The Board of 
                         Ed. cut the budget, the District had 
                         to comply, and as of the end of this 
                         term, the violin program has been... 
                         excessed.

               Roberta takes this in, momentarily speechless. In the b.g., 
               the beginners slip into the hall to watch.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Excessed.
                              (beat)
                         They specifically said that my violin 
                         program has to go.

                                     JANET
                         They've slashed the budget -- music 
                         and art programs got hit the worst.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What about Dennis' classes?

                                     DENNIS
                         I'm tenured, Roberta.

               Roberta looks at him, then back to Janet.

                                     ROBERTA
                         When was this decided?

                                     JANET
                         Things happened very quickly... I 
                         wanted to tell you myself --

                                     ROBERTA
                              (reeling)
                         I just... I can't even believe this 
                         is happening!

                                     DENNIS
                         Why not? You're a sub. Your position 
                         has never been permanent.

                                     JANET
                         Shut up, Dennis! You're not helping!
                              (softly, to Roberta)
                         Come into my office, please.

               They leave Dennis standing there, looking as if he's had his 
               face slapped.

               INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                     ROBERTA
                         There's gotta be a way to fight this!

                                     JANET
                         Fight it with what? I don't have any 
                         other extra programs to give them 
                         instead.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh, I see. So after ten years, after 
                         fourteen hundred children have learned 
                         to play the violin, this is just an 
                         "extra program."

                                     JANET
                         You know I don't feel that way and 
                         you know damn well I've been standing 
                         by you all these years! You think I 
                         haven't noticed what you've done for 
                         these kids?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Then do something!

                                     JANET
                              (points to her phone)
                         I've been on this phone for the past 
                         three days trying to "do something" -- 
                         the District office can't even stand 
                         the sound of my voice. Believe me, 
                         there are some people around here 
                         I'd much rather get rid of. But as 
                         far as the Board's concerned, violin 
                         classes are not a priority.

               Roberta's fury starts to give way to grief. She looks terribly 
               wounded. Janet looks at her helplessly.

                                     JANET
                         I don't have the power here, Roberta. 
                         I'm so sorry.

               A beat, and Roberta exits.

               EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

               Roberta's dazed and in pain as she walks through the crowds 
               of children, oblivious to kids calling her name and waving.

               Nick and Lexi enter the darkened house, chatting as Nick 
               wheels in the bike and Lexi bounces a basketball. They turn

                         sitting at the kitchen table with a 
                         glass of wine, her face ashen.

                                     NICK
                         What happened?

               EXT. STREETS - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

               Roberta, Nick and Lexi walk Allegra in their neighborhood. 
               Roberta looks worn out.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm a good teacher. I've worked so 
                         hard to give these kids something to 
                         be proud of.

               Lexi moves to comfort her.

                                     LEXI
                         I'm so sorry, Mom. I can't believe 
                         they did this to you.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It's like when my father got killed. 
                         For twenty years, he followed every 
                         safety rule the factory had, and 
                         then someone else flips the wrong 
                         switch...
                              (she chokes up)
                         It's not fair. You do everything 
                         right and then...

                                     NICK
                         It's the wrong analogy. You couldn't 
                         do anything about Grandpa's death. 
                         It was irreversible. This isn't.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Tell that to the Board of Education.

                                     NICK
                         Let me ask you something. Why did 
                         you risk your life for a bicycle?

               Roberta and Lexi look at Nick, baffled as to the relevance 
               of the question.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I did not risk my life.

                                     NICK
                         Of course you did! That building? 
                         Threatening Henry? And for what -- 
                         two hundred dollars?

                                     ROBERTA
                         No. Not for that.

                                     LEXI
                         Then why?

                                     ROBERTA
                         When someone steals something that 
                         belongs to my kids, I'm not gonna 
                         sit back and let that happen!

               A beat as she realizes what she's just said. The boys look 
               at her and the three of them stop walking.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Guys -- you need to think about this. 
                         If I try to fight this -- with no 
                         salary coming in -- I could lose the 
                         house, screw up your college plans... 
                         It would be a lot safer to just go 
                         out tomorrow and get a job in a 
                         private school.

                                     LEXI
                         Yeah, but is that where you really 
                         want to be?

               INT. ROBERTA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta frantically searches through her purse, then crosses 
               to a hall closet and quickly checks the pockets of her coats 
               and jackets.

               She feels inside a jacket pocket, then finds it: DOROTHEA'S 
               BUSINESS CARD.

               EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY

               INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DEPT. OF JOURNALISM - DAY

               FOLLOW DAN PAXTON as he walks down the hall towards his office 
               and sees a strange silver object on the floor in front of 
               his office door. He picks it up.

               INSERT

               -- A foil-covered plate with a note on top: DO YOU KNOW ANYONE 
               AT THE NEW YORK TIMES?

               BACK TO SCENE

               Dan lifts up the foil to reveal a large piece of LASAGNA.

               INT. CPE 1 AUDITORIUM - THE CONCERT - STAGE - NIGHT

               SEVENTY-FIVE KIDS play "We Shall Overcome" and it's incredibly 
               moving. Nick's on cello, Lexi plays piano. ROBERTA proudly 
               leads the children. At the side of the stage, we see DOROTHEA 
               photographing the concert. THE CAMERA PANS THE AUDIENCE of 
               teary-eyed parents, many of them with CAM CORDERS. We FIND 
               Ramon's family. Manuelo is riverted by his son's playing, 
               and he starts to cry. Concepcion knows this without looking. 
               She takes his hand.

               ANGLE - JANET stands along the side and her eyes start to 
               fill with tears. She tries to stay composed, then discreetly 
               exits the auditorium.

               The song ends and the audience APPLAUDS, rising from their 
               seats, including ASSUNTA (now 65), next to ISABEL and DAN. 
               Someone remains seated: a REPORTER (40's), sitting beside 
               Dan and taking notes.

               The STUDENTS bow, then point to Roberta who bows and takes 
               the stage. She gestures for people to sit. A beginner student 
               brings her flowers. Roberta kisses her, then approaches the 
               mike.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to the audience)
                         The beautiful concert that you just 
                         heard could be the last concert of 
                         the East Harlem Violin Program. The 
                         Board of Education and the District 
                         Superintendent don't think that music 
                         is important for our children. But 
                         they're wrong -- and they're in for 
                         a fight.

               The parents stand and applaud. We see the REPORTER writing 
               quickly. Dorothea snaps more pictures. Roberta extends an 
               arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them. Ramon 
               gives her a thumbs up.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               ROBERTA is vacuuming the living room while Assunta dusts. 
               Extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation 
               for a meeting. The doorbell RINGS.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Someone's early.

               FOLLOW ASSUNTA to the DOOR. She opens it, revealing JANET, 
               who's carrying two bags of groceries. Assunta's demeanor 
               instantly cools when she sees her. In the b.g. Roberta sees 
               Janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner.

                                     JANET
                         Hello, Assunta. How are you?

                                     ASSUNTA
                         I'd be a lot better if my daughter 
                         had a job next year.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Ma!

                                     JANET
                              (to Assunta)
                         I would too.

               Janet briskly walks into THE LIVING ROOM, puts the grocery 
               bags down on a table, and begins to take things out of them. 
               Roberta watches her, mystified.

                                     JANET
                              (to Roberta)
                         Sorry I'm early, but I figured we'd 
                         need time to set up.

               Roberta watches Janet for a beat, then addresses Assunta.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Mama, why don't you take Allegra out 
                         for a walk?

               Assunta hesitates for a beat, then gets the dog and exits. 
               Janet continues unpacking the bags as if there's nothing 
               unusual about her being there. Cheeses, crackers, bread, 
               salads, fruit, paper plates, napkins, etc. She sees Roberta's 
               confused expression.

                                     JANET
                         You are having a meeting here tonight, 
                         right? Parents and teachers?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, yes, but ...

                                     JANET
                         Take it from me. If you want to get 
                         parents to help you with something, 
                         you have to feed them.

               She holds up two wedges of cheese.

                                     JANET
                         You have a cutting board for these?

               Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting 
               board and a knife.

                                     JANET
                              (as she continues to 
                              unpack)
                         And if you think parents are bad, 
                         teachers are even worse, no offense. 
                         If you don't feed them, you never 
                         get anything extra out of them. That's 
                         why I got this.

               She pulls out an Entenmann's blackout cake.

                                     JANET
                         Entenmann's gets them every time.

               Roberta continues to stare in amazement at Janet.

                                     JANET
                         What? Don't tell me you expected me 
                         to bring something homemade.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (as she takes the 
                              cake from her)
                         Well, no... I --

                                     JANET
                         Good. Because take it from me -- my 
                         own family begs me to stay out of 
                         the kitchen.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What I didn't expect was for you to 
                         be here.

                                     JANET
                         Why not? We've gotta figure out a 
                         way to fight this.
                              (as she arranges 
                              crackers on a plate)
                         After ten years, Roberta, I can't 
                         imagine walking through those hallways 
                         and not hearing that off-key, 
                         screechy, scratchy, nails-on-the-
                         blackboard violin music.

               Roberta smiles. Janet holds up a baguette.

                                     JANET
                         What do you think? Cut it into slices 
                         now, or leave it whole?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Let's cut it now. It'll be less messy.

               Janet hands her the bread. A beat as the two women exchange 
               a private smile, then return to their respective tasks.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               There's a crowd of PARENTS assembled in Roberta's front room, 
               talking at once, yelling out ideas, including CONCEPCION, 
               BEVERLY WILSON (Shandra's mom), MR. ADAMS (Black) and MRS. 
               ADAMS (Puerto Rican), the parents of James (from Roberta's 
               first year) and Simon. DOROTHEA, JANET, ISABEL are also there; 
               ASSUNTA is keeping tabs on the refreshments.

                                     ISABEL
                         Don't they realize how much this 
                         program helps the kids?

                                     MR. ADAMS
                         Simon's our third child to study 
                         with Roberta. James is pre-med, 
                         April's valedictorian -- now that 
                         says something!

                                     MR. KLEIN
                         I think we should inundate the Board 
                         and the District with letters.

                                     JANET
                         You're wasting your time. The Board 
                         and the District are not gonna pay 
                         for this program, no matter how many 
                         letters they get.

               Disappointed grumblings.

                                     ISABEL
                         What if we raise the money ourselves?

                                     JANET
                         I can't see how they'd object to 
                         that.

               A beat as people take this in.

                                     CONCEPCION
                         Well once that newspaper article 
                         comes out, that should help bring in 
                         money.

                                     BEVERLY
                         Yeah, but what if it doesn't? For 
                         all we know, it's gonna be buried on 
                         the back page. Besides, who says 
                         anyone's gonna give a damn about our 
                         kids?

                                     DOROTHEA
                              (to Roberta)
                         What if you do a benefit concert? We 
                         can raise a batch of money from ticket 
                         sales, and then the concert itself 
                         could be great publicity. There's 
                         word of mouth... you could get 
                         reviewed...

                                     ROBERTA
                         It better be a good concert!

               Some people laugh but we see the anxiety on Roberta's face.

                                     ROBERTA
                         We have to offer something more than 
                         me and the kids.
                              (to Dorothea)
                         Do you think maybe your husband would 
                         perform with us?

                                     DOROTHEA
                              (slyly)
                         I'm sure I could persuade him with a 
                         little pillow talk. And maybe he can 
                         get another violinist too -- Itzhak 
                         Perlman, perhaps.

               This gets people's attention.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That would be fantastic.

                                     DOROTHEA
                         We could rent a place like the 92nd 
                         Street Y -- it's perfect for this. 
                         It seats about nine hundred people 
                         and if we charge between fifty and a 
                         hundred a ticket --

                                     ISABEL
                              (to Roberta)
                         We could probably raise enough to 
                         reinstate your program for a year.

                                     JANET
                         Sounds like a plan.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (half to herself)
                         It better be a good concert.

               The DOORBELL RINGS and Roberta crosses to get it. DAN enters, 
               holding copies of the NY POST, the DAILY NEWS, and a couple 
               of other papers. Each paper has been opened to a specific 
               page.

                                     DAN
                         Take your pick.

               Roberta grabs the top one -- the POST -- opened to page 5.

               INSERT

               The page has a photo of Roberta at the Spring Concert, and a 
               large article headlined A VIOLIN TEACHER FIGHTS BACK.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Lots of chaos as a TELEVISION NEWS CREW sets up. Roberta 
               tries futilely to get the beginners to pay attention to her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Kids, listen to me -- it's really 
                         important that you don't look at the 
                         camera and you try to act as natural 
                         as possible.

               Dennis storms in.

                                     DENNIS
                         Who authorized this?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Janet.

                                     DENNIS
                         Well Janet's not here today and I 
                         want these people out of here.

               The kids quiet down and watch them argue. A CAMERA GUY starts 
               shooting the argument and Dennis sees him.

                                     DENNIS
                         Turn that off, you hear me?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Why are you doing this? We're not 
                         bothering anyone.

                                     DENNIS
                         You're disrupting school and I want 
                         them out of here -- now.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You still don't get it, do you? I 
                         don't care if you hate me, Dennis -- 
                         that's your business. But think about 
                         the students for once. Every time 
                         you interfere, you're not hurting me -- 
                         you're hurting them.

               She points to the kids. They're silent, waiting to see if 
               Roberta got through to him. A beat.

                                     DENNIS
                         Get these people out of here or I'm 
                         calling the police.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Go right ahead, call them. That'll 
                         look real good on the eleven o'clock 
                         news.

               A beat and he exits. Roberta takes a deep breath, then turns 
               back to the kids who are watching her, impressed.

                                     RAMON
                         I don't hear no sirens.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               ON THE TV is the news segment: ROBERTA speaks to an unseen 
               interviewer.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm from a blue collar family, and 
                         if it weren't for the lessons I got 
                         in public school, I never would have 
                         learned the violin.

               It CUTS TO Roberta's beginners speaking to the interviewer.

                                     INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                         How does it make you feel to lose 
                         your violin program?

                                     SHANDRA
                         It makes us sad!

                                     RAMON
                         Yeah, like we're never gonna have no 
                         more violin lessons --

                                     VANESSA
                         And it's bad because... because we 
                         love violin class.

               WIDER - REVEAL Roberta, Lexi and Nick watching the TV.

               INT. ARNOLD STEINHARDT AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               ON TV - THE SAME NEWS SEGMENT, ANOTHER SOUND BITE

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yes, I've gotten offers from two 
                         private schools, but this is where I 
                         want to be.

                                     DOROTHEA (O.S.)
                         Arnold, these kids need help.

               WIDER - REVEAL a comfortable Upper East Side apartment and 
               DOROTHEA watching T.V. while ARNOLD practices violin. There's 
               FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHY on the walls, signed by Dorothea.

                                     ARNOLD
                         Didn't we send them a donation?

                                     DOROTHEA
                         They need something bigger. And you 
                         can't just write a check -- you have 
                         to get involved.

                                     ARNOLD
                         Involved how?

               The look on her face tells him it's more than he bargained 
               for.

                                     ARNOLD
                         Uh-oh.

               INT. SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

               1. Arnold Steinhardt speaks on the phone. His Roladex is 
               open to the name ITZHAK PERLMAN. In the b.g., Dorothea tensely 
               waits to hear if Itzhak Perlman will say yes.

               2. Parents, Roberta, Nick and Lexi hang "FIDDLEFEST CONCERT" 
               posters around their neighborhood, announcing a concert at 
               THE 92ND STREET Y with ARNOLD STEINHARDT, ITZHAK PERLMAN and 
               STUDENTS FROM THE EAST HARLEM VIOLIN PROGRAM.

               3. Parents -- including Beverly Wilson, Concepcion, Mr. Adams 
               and Carlos' mom and dad -- stuff envelopes with INVITATIONS 
               to "FIDDLEFEST" and accompanying LETTERS and TICKET ORDER 
               FORMS. Roberta and Dorothea open envelopes with filled-out 
               TICKET ORDER FORMS and CHECKS. They stack the checks in a 
               pile, address return envelopes and place FIDDLEFEST TICKETS 
               inside them.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Thirty-three excited kids from Roberta's different classes 
               chat, tune their violins, rosin their bows. The students 
               include Carlos, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Rachel, Simon, 
               Ramon, Vanessa, and Shandra. Roberta enters the room, full 
               of energy, and addresses them as she heads to the front.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Listen up, everyone! Quiet down!

               The students give her their attention.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You are my very best beginner and 
                         advanced violin students and I've 
                         chosen you to play in Fiddlefest 
                         because I trust that you can handle 
                         the pressure. It's gonna be a lot of 
                         work -- a lot. Right now, we've sold 
                         some tickets, but I'm not gonna be 
                         back here in the fall if the audience 
                         storms out of their seats, demanding 
                         a refund!

               She nods to Rachel who starts handing out sheets of music.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Rachel's gonna be my lieutenant and 
                         I expect you to listen to her.

               Ramon looks through his music sheets.

                                     RAMON
                         Bach's "Minuet One"?

                                     ROBERTA
                         People are gonna be paying good money 
                         for this concert -- we're not just 
                         gonna play "Twinkle."
                              (handing out papers)
                         I'm passing out a contract that you 
                         and your parents need to sign.

               The kids read the contracts. Carlos' eyes widen.

                                     CARLOS
                         Every Saturday and Sunday?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Plus night time rehearsals during 
                         the week. There's only six weeks 
                         till the concert, so classes in school 
                         won't be enough.

               The kids look sobered by this.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Come to think of it, we'll probably 
                         also need to meet before school.

               Lots of grumbling: "Say what?" "No way!" "Before school?" 
               I'ma be sleepwalking!"

                                     ROBERTA
                         You've heard of Navy Seal Training? 
                         Well, this is gonna be Roberta String 
                         Training.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - Two young men and two young women walk in, 
               carrying violins. We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM 
               (20), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall. 
               With him is DE SEAN (19), a short guy with dreadlocks, looking 
               more like a rapper than a violinist. GUADALUPE (19), walking 
               with a cane, is now a beautiful young woman, her long braid 
               pinned up. The fourth is a reserved Puerto Rican woman (20).

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh my god! Naeem! De Sean!
                              (hugs them)
                         Guadalupe!

               She hugs her, then looks closely at the other woman.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Lucy? Is that you?

               The woman snaps her fingers and smiles. Roberta laughs and 
               embraces her, then turns to the students.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Kids, these are four of my very first 
                         violin students and I've asked them 
                         to play in the concert with us.
                              (to the alumni)
                         I was just telling them how hard 
                         they're gonna have to work.

                                     DE SEAN
                              (to class)
                         Take it from me -- this lady don't 
                         lie. Y'all are gonna work your butts 
                         off.

               INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ramon's father carefully reads the violin contract while 
               Ramon and Concepcion anxiously watch. He stops to look up a 
               word in the English-Spanish dictionary beside him. Ramon and 
               his mom are squirming. Manuelo nods as he finishes reading, 
               then SIGNS the contract. Ramon breaks into a smile, throws 
               his little arms around his Papa and kisses him.

               School's letting out; Carlos' sister exits, carrying Carlos' 
               violin. A few beats later, Carlos quickly exits, checking 
               his watch. He sees his LOS LEONES teammates standing in a 
               group, and tries to bypass them without being noticed, but 
               they spot him.

                                     TEAMMATE #1
                         Hey Carlos! Where ya goin'? We got a 
                         game, remember?

                                     CARLOS
                         Yeah, I know, but... I can't make 
                         it.

                                     TEAMMATE #1
                         What you talkin' about?

                                     CARLOS
                         I just can't make it.

                                     TEAMMATE #2
                         You got a date with the violin 
                         teacher?

               A beat.

                                     CARLOS
                         Yeah. I do.

               He dashes off, a barrage of Spanish and English curses behind 
               him, and crosses to his sister, waiting for him DOWN THE 
               STREET. He takes the violin from her and carries it himself.

               INT. CPE MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               The Fiddlefest kids, including Carlos, Vanessa, Shandra, 
               Ramon, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Simon, Thomas, De Sean and 
               Guadalupe practice Bach's "Minuet One," Roberta leading them 
               and giving direction. They're playing badly.

               Rachel plays as well, but walks around the room making 
               corrections. It's early morning, and the kids look half-
               asleep.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Frog! Frog! I need more accents on 
                         the down beat! More bow! More!

               They play a few more bars and still sound pretty bad.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Stop! Stop!
                              (they do so)
                         You sound horrible! Isn't anyone 
                         practicing?

                                     CARLOS
                         How can we practice? We're rehearsing 
                         all the time.

               Some kids laugh, including Stephanie.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to Stephanie)
                         You think this is funny, Stephanie?
                              (to all of them)
                         You think the four hundred people 
                         who've bought tickets so far will 
                         think it's funny too? You think Itzhak 
                         Perlman will think it's funny that 
                         he's donating his time and you're 
                         all gonna stink?

               Vanessa yawns and Roberta sees her. Uh-oh.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Am I boring you, Vanessa?

                                     VANESSA
                         No. It's 7:30 in the morning. I'm 
                         just tired.

                                     ROBERTA
                         There's no time to be tired.
                              (to all, getting her 
                              violin in position)
                         Let's try it again.

               INT. ARNOLD AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Dorothea opens the door for Roberta who just charges in, 
               agitated, without even saying hello. We sense that Dorothea 
               too, is troubled by something.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I must have been crazy to agree to 
                         this. They're never gonna be ready. 
                         And you should hear the Bach Double! 
                         A disaster. So the good news is 
                         tickets are selling like hot cakes, 
                         but the bad news is that the kids 
                         sound like shit.

                                     DOROTHEA
                         There's more bad news... We've lost 
                         the Y.

               Roberta looks at her, aghast.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?!

                                     DOROTHEA
                         They had a flood -- a water heater 
                         burst... The concert hall was damaged 
                         and they've cancelled all events.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Until when?

                                     DOROTHEA
                         "Until further notice."

                                     ROBERTA
                         This can't happen! We've sold tickets! 
                         We've done publicity! The concert's 
                         in three weeks!

                                     DOROTHEA
                         I've been on the phone all morning 
                         calling other theaters. Nothing's 
                         available.

               They both sink into the couch, completely undone by this.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Just keep looking.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               The Fiddlefest kids are crammed into Roberta's house, 
               (including De Sean, Guadalupe, Ramon, Vanessa, Shandra, 
               Carlos, Thomas, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, and Simon), 
               rehearsing "Orange Blossom Special." They play badly. Rachel 
               helps Roberta correct students.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Stop! Someone's playing the wrong 
                         notes! And you shouldn't need your 
                         music anymore! Except for the Bach 
                         Double, everything has to be memorized 
                         by next rehearsal!

               The kids look at each other, daunted.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And you sound like you're 
                         sleepwalking. Your heart's not even 
                         in it.

                                     VANESSA
                         Maybe 'cause we don't have a place 
                         for the concert.

               Roberta looks at her, and then notices the despondent looks 
               on many of the kids' faces.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, you're right. This might all 
                         be for nothing. So we can either 
                         keep on rehearsing in case we find a 
                         place -- or we can just... give up.

                                     DE SEAN
                         Am I hearing right? Did you use the 
                         words "give up"?
                              (to the students)
                         Let's take a vote. How many of you 
                         want to give up?

               No one raises a hand. Roberta takes this in.

                                     GUADALUPE
                         See? You taught us well.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - DAY

               It's early morning. Lexi cooks breakfast while Nick and 
               Roberta look at scribbled-on, marked-up lists.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What about in the Bronx?

                                     NICK
                         There's nothing.
                              (beat)
                         Why don't you just do it in one of 
                         the schools? It'll be a lot smaller 
                         but --

                                     ROBERTA
                         We won't make enough money.

                                     LEXI
                         What about postponing it?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Itzhak and Arnold are booked all 
                         summer.

               They all look depressed. Lexi places an equally depressing-
               looking stack of pancakes on the table. There's a BANGING on 
               the door, startling everyone.

                                     DOROTHEA (O.S.)
                         It's Dorothea.

               Nick opens the door and Dorothea rushes in, out of breath, 
               talking a mile a minute.

                                     DOROTHEA
                         I have good news -- really good news. 
                         Arnold got a call from his friend 
                         Wally Scheur who heard about us losing 
                         the Y and wanted to see how he could 
                         help -- and then Wally had this 
                         brilliant idea and called his friend 
                         Isaac Stern and it's all arranged! 
                         We have a new place for Fiddlefest!

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where?

                                     DOROTHEA
                         Carnegie Hall.

               Dorothea grins from ear to ear, Nick and Lexi whoop and 
               holler, and all wait for Roberta to jump up and down for joy -- 
               but she looks stricken.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (panicked)
                         Carnegie Hall?

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - DAY

               CLOSE ON THE CEILING OF CARNEGIE HALL, revolving slowly.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS IS ROBERTA'S POV

               She stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she 
               slowly turns around. She's holding her violin case. She looks 
               at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE ORCHESTRA 
               SEATS. Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of 
               the stage, then stops.

               CLOSE ON ROBERTA

               We can see her imagining the audience on the night of the 
               concert. She can't believe her eyes. A beat, and she looks 
               around to make sure she's alone. She takes out her violin, 
               takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her "audience," 
               then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double 
               Concerto. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening. 
               Roberta stops.

                                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Incredible sound in this room, no?

               Roberta turns to see ISAAC STERN approaching her. She's 
               completely flustered.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh my god -- Isaac Stern.

                                     ISAAC STERN
                         You must be Roberta.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Thank you so much for helping us.

                                     ISAAC STERN
                              (looking out at the 
                              hall)
                         Would you believe in 1960, they tried 
                         to tear this place down? They wanted 
                         to replace it with a bright red 
                         skyscraper -- we called it "the red 
                         terror."

                                     ROBERTA
                         You're kidding.

                                     ISAAC STERN
                         We had to fight like hell, but with 
                         a lot of help, we saved Carnegie 
                         Hall.

               Roberta takes this in, relating it to her own struggle.

                                     ISAAC STERN
                         If it's all right with you, I'd like 
                         to play in your concert. Maybe bring 
                         a couple of friends...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yes, of course! That would be great!

               Isaac nods, then touches her shoulder.

                                     ISAAC STERN
                         Don't give up.

               EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE, UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY

               Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding 
               cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly. Dan sits 
               across from her, observing.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I just don't see how I'm gonna do 
                         this. It's huge. It's gigantic! It's 
                         Carnegie Hall! And listen to this: 
                         now Isaac Stern wants to play with 
                         us -- Diane Monroe, Michael Tree -- 
                         there's other people calling --

                                     DAN
                         That's fantastic!

                                     ROBERTA
                         Fantastic? I'll never get the kids 
                         up to speed in time, I'll never get 
                         myself up to speed. I'm gonna be 
                         playing side by side with the world's 
                         greatest violinists.

                                     DAN
                         And "the world's greatest violinists" 
                         are playing side by side with you 
                         because they want to help you win 
                         this fight.

               He offers her a forkful of some decadent-looking chocolate 
               cake, but she shakes her head.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Yes, but... you don't understand. 
                         Maybe there's a good reason why I 
                         never made it as a violinist -- maybe 
                         I just can't cut it. I keep blaming 
                         it on not having enough early 
                         training, but if I were talented, if 
                         I had a gift --

                                     DAN
                         But you do have a gift. You're gonna 
                         put thirty East Harlem kids on stage 
                         at Carnegie Hall not because they're 
                         prodigies, but because you got them 
                         to stick with something that's hard 
                         as hell and to strive for excellence -- 
                         which, by the way, I certainly wasn't 
                         striving for when I was their age. 
                         Not to mention the other ten years' 
                         worth of students whose lives were 
                         changed because of you. That's your 
                         talent, Roberta.

               She takes this in, looks at him gratefully and puts her hand 
               over his. He strokes her hand.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm scared.

                                     DAN
                         I know.
                              (beat)
                         And by the way, I happen to think 
                         you're a pretty good violinist too.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You've barely heard me play.

                                     DAN
                         I've heard enough to know you're 
                         gonna do just fine.

               Roberta looks at him with trepidation. Dan takes another 
               forkful of his cake.

                                     DAN
                         Besides, no one's gonna be paying 
                         attention to your playing anyway.

               Roberta laughs. Dan smiles, glad he got her to lighten up.

               EXT. CPE 1 - DAY (EARLY MORNING)

               The Fiddlefest kids (including Ramon, Shandra, Vanessa, De 
               Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Simon, Stephanie, Amanda and 
               Kenny -- but RACHEL is absent) stand outside the locked school 
               gate, waiting for Roberta. Some of the kids have their violins 
               out of the cases, tuning them.

                                     CARLOS
                         Teacher's late. I think she should 
                         be dropped, don't you?

               Kids laugh.

                                     RAMON
                         Yeah. I don't think we should let 
                         her play in Fiddlefest!

               A few kids start playing "CAN-CAN." It catches on, and more 
               of them join in. PASSERSBY stop to listen, and some drop 
               change into the open cases. RAMON and a couple of other kids 
               grin at this.

               CARLOS steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an 
               uncanny imitation of Roberta:

                                     CARLOS
                         More bow! To the frog! You sound 
                         terrible! I can't believe how terrible 
                         you sound!

               The kids crack up, but a few spot ROBERTA heading quickly up 
               the street. Carlos is oblivious to this -- and no one signals 
               him that Roberta's watching.

                                     CARLOS
                         You're gonna make everyone in Carnegie 
                         Hall sick to their stomachs! That's 
                         right, they're gonna pay a thousand 
                         dollars a ticket and you're gonna 
                         make them throw up on their gowns 
                         and tuxedos!

               Carlos senses a presence and turns to see Roberta. A tense 
               beat as he awaits her reaction.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (in all seriousness)
                         If you're gonna imitate me, do it 
                         right.
                              (corrects his posture)
                         Shoulders back. Violin higher. Check 
                         your feet. There.
                              (beat)
                         G'head, Carlos. Continue.

               Carlos freezes.

                                     CARLOS
                         No, that's O.K. You can take it from 
                         here.

               Roberta nods, and addresses the kids as she unlocks the gate.

                                     ROBERTA
                         He's right, by the way. You do sound 
                         terrible, and you are gonna make 
                         everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to 
                         their stomachs.

               The kids start filing in. Rachel comes up the street and 
               catches up to Roberta.

                                     RACHEL
                         I need to talk to you.

               Roberta sees how distressed Rachel looks.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (to kids)
                         I'll be right in. Start on Minuet 
                         One.
                              (to Rachel)
                         What's wrong?

                                     RACHEL
                         We're moving away.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What? Where are you moving?

                                     RACHEL
                              (looking downward)
                         It's a secret... My father... he's 
                         been hurting my mom... We have to 
                         leave.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (gently)
                         Has he been hurting you too?

               Rachel shakes her head no, then starts to cry a little.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry about Julliard... and the 
                         concert.

               She hands Roberta her violin.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Keep it. Take it with you.

                                     RACHEL
                         No... I don't want to play anymore.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What?! You can't give up violin, 
                         Rachel -- it's a part of you. A very 
                         important part.

               Rachel looks anguished. Roberta moves closer and touches her 
               arm.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Please honey. Just take it.

                                     RACHEL
                         I don't want to.

               Roberta looks at her, pained, then hugs her. Rachel quickly 
               kisses Roberta goodbye and exits. Roberta watches her.

               INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

               Roberta leads De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Stephanie, 
               Thomas, Carlos, Erica and Nicholas in the Bach Double 
               Concerto. The other kids watch. Roberta's on the edge of 
               hysteria. She signals the players to stop.

                                     ROBERTA
                         No, no, no! Accent the up bow after 
                         the slurred notes and then it'll get 
                         you off of those slurred notes! You 
                         Double Concerto kids need to be 
                         working harder! This is the grand 
                         finale of the concert! You're each 
                         gonna be sharing a music stand with 
                         one of the world's greatest 
                         violinists!

               The kids say "the world's greatest violinists" along with 
               her -- they've obviously been hearing this a lot. Roberta 
               glares at them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think we should forget the Bach 
                         Double.
                              (to the other kids)
                         And you guys are never gonna get 
                         Minuet One. I think we should drop 
                         that too.

                                     VANESSA
                         No! We can do it, Roberta!

                                     CARLOS
                         And we'll get the Bach Double. We 
                         will.

               She stops, takes a breath.

                                     NAEEM
                         It's gonna be O.K., Roberta.

                                     ROBERTA
                              (vulnerable)
                         You think?

               All the kids nod. A few beats.

                                     ROBERTA
                         O.K...
                              (not believing it)
                         It's gonna be O.K.

               She crosses to take a look at her music, and the kids exchange 
               looks that say, "Oh shit. What did we just promise?"

               REHEARSAL MONTAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

               1. Carlos practices violin against the fence around River 
               East School. In the b. g., his buddies make fun of him.

               2. Shandra practices in a school stairwell, ignoring a boy 
               who pulls one of her braids as he passes by.

               3. Stephanie practices at a bus stop, her eyes closed, then 
               looks up and realizes she's just missed her bus.

               4. Ramon practices in his living room, his father watching 
               attentively, then helping him lift the violin higher.

               5. Vanessa practices in a crowded school hallway, frustrated 
               as kids keep bumping into her.

               6. Roberta, in her nightgown, practices in front of her 
               refrigerator in the middle of the night.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

               Pandemonium. Nick and Lexi, both in tuxes, are doing several 
               tasks at once while Roberta, in a simple black velvet dress 
               and stockinged feet, tries to put on her makeup but keeps 
               poking her head out of the bathroom, giving orders. Allegra 
               BARKS outside the back door.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Nick -- did you feed Allegra?

                                     NICK
                              (fixing Lexi's tie)
                         Yes, Mom.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Lexi, can you make sure the charts 
                         are still in my bag?

                                     LEXI
                         I already checked, Mom.

                                     ROBERTA (O.S.)
                         Check again, please. And look for my 
                         repair kit too.

               ASSUNTA descends the staircase, dressed in a formal dress. 
               She holds a small jewelry box and heads for the bathroom.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         Bert, which earrings you want?

               Roberta sticks her head out and picks the earrings. Assunta 
               enters the small bathroom to work on her own makeup.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Nick? Get two more violins.

                                     NICK
                         You've already got two -- how many 
                         emergencies can there be?

               A beat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Get three more. And make sure a couple 
                         of them are half-size.

               Nick rolls his eyes and runs upstairs while Lexi organizes 
               things by the door: Nick's cello, Roberta's papers, extra 
               violins. Roberta rushes out of the bathroom, adjusting the 
               earrings. She starts compulsively straightening the house.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Lexi -- can you call about the car 
                         again?

                                     LEXI
                         Mom, they're not gonna forget to 
                         send a car!

               Nick comes running down the stairs with the violins and stares 
               in disbelief at Roberta fluffing a couch pillow.

                                     NICK
                         What are you doing?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Just straightening a little.

                                     NICK
                         You're insane, you know that?
                              (grabs the pillow)
                         Finish getting dressed!

               He throws the pillow onto the couch. Roberta heads upstairs.

               reflection of his baseball bat, glove and trophies in the 
               room behind him.

               INT. GUADALUPE'S ROOM - DAY

               Guadalupe's mom pins up her braid, then steps back to look 
               at her daughter, radiant in a floral gown. Her mom starts to 
               cry.

               INT. SHANDRA'S ROOM - DAY

               Beverly puts rhinestone-studded barrettes in Shandra's hair.

               ON RAMON - He's in a sharp black suit and looks very dapper. 
               WIDER - Manuelo and Concepcion stand back to admire him, 
               then Manuelo straightens Ramon's tie, brimming with pride 
               over his son.

               INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - FRONT ROOM - DAY

                                     ROBERTA (O.S.)
                         SHIT!

               Nick and Assunta look towards the stairs. Roberta comes 
               running down.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Can you believe this?

               She turns around, revealing a RIP on the back of the dress, 
               next to the zipper. The DOORBELL RINGS.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It can't be time! Is it time?

                                     ASSUNTA
                         I'll sew it in the car.

               EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

               Roberta, Assunta and the boys step outside, amazed to see a 
               STRETCH LIMOUSINE double-parked in front, a CHAUFFEUR waiting.

                                     LEXI
                         See? I told you they'd send a car.

               Roberta's open-mouthed. She leads her entourage towards the 
               limo. THE NEIGHBORS come out of their houses to watch. Some 
               lean out windows, gawking. Ad libs... "Who's that?" "It's 
               the Violin Lady!" LAWRENCE, dressed in a tux, gives Lexi a 
               high sign.

               The chauffeur helps Roberta and Assunta into the limo while 
               Nick and Lexi start to load the instruments into the trunk.

               INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

               Roberta sits down beside Assunta and turns around so Assunta 
               can mend the tear in her dress. Assunta partially unzips the 
               dress and starts stitching it from the inside.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Thank you, Mama.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         Don't worry about it. You rip -- I 
                         sew.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Not just for that.
                              (beat)
                         Thank you for getting me out of bed.

               Assunta stitches, remembering, and smiles.

                                     ASSUNTA
                         Don't thank me -- thank Charles.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Charles?!

                                     ASSUNTA
                         If that jerk hadn't of left you, 
                         none of this would've happened.

               Roberta contemplates this. A beat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Thank you, Charles.

               Her last stitch finished, Assunta rips the needle from the 
               thread.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               The kids and their parents are practically boiling over with 
               excitement. Last minute kisses, violin tunings, and clothing 
               adjustments take place throughout the room.

               The boys are in suits or tuxes, the girls in velvet or 
               flowered dresses, some with bows in their hair, some with 
               their hair up in buns. Roberta tries to take a head count, 
               Dorothea confers with a stage manager, Assunta fixes a boy's 
               tie, and Janet helps one girl with her hair, stopping in the 
               middle to button the back of another girl's dress.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Where's Vanessa? Has anyone seen 
                         Vanessa?

               Janet looks at her, concerned.

                                     JANET
                         I'll call her house.

               ANGLE - Roberta sees MRS. ADISA enter the room with Naeem. 
               The two women walk towards each other and embrace. As they 
               start to chat, Roberta suddenly sees someone and excuses 
               herself: BRIAN is walking towards her, wearing a tux. They 
               smile at each other, but Roberta's clearly a bit shaken to 
               see him. They're not quite sure how to greet each other -- 
               he takes her hand, and then kisses her on the cheek.

                                     BRIAN
                         Congratulations.

                                     ROBERTA

                         I knew you'd get here sooner or later. 
                         I'm glad I'm here to see it.

               A beat.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I am too.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE WINGS AREA - NIGHT

               Guadalupe shyly approaches Itzhak Perlman, her mother behind 
               her, silently encouraging her.

                                     GUADALUPE
                         Excuse me, Mr. Perlman?

               He turns around.

                              (extends a hand)
                         I'm Guadalupe. I've wanted to meet 
                         you for a long time.

               He smiles at her and they shake hands.

                                     ITZHAK PERLMAN
                         A pleasure to meet you, Guadalupe.

               As Guadalupe introduces him to her mother, CARLOS approaches.

                                     CARLOS
                         You nervous, Mr. Perlman?

                                     ITZHAK PERLMAN
                         Should I be?

                                     CARLOS

                         know about you guys. How much did 
                         you practice?

               Itzhak Perlman laughs.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               Roberta talks to Janet with a worried expression.

                                     ROBERTA
                         You called Vanessa's father and 
                         mother?

                                     JANET
                         No answer at either.

               A Carnegie Hall staff person in a suit enters.

                                     STAFF PERSON
                         Half hour call! It's now half hour 
                         call! So pace yourself accordingly. 
                         Don't get more than thirty minutes 
                         worth of nervous!

               The room electrifies with nerves.

               VANESSA

               rushes into the room with her father. She's out of breath, 
               her stocking has a big run in it, and she's in tears.

                                     VANESSA
                         They stole the car!

                         With the violin.

                         Oh my God.
                              (calling)
                         Nick, Lexi --

                         Done.

               The boys rush over to the extra violins and look to find the 
               right size.

                                     VANESSA
                              (crying)
                         And then when we were getting a taxi, 
                         I fell down.

               Roberta comforts her and Janet moves in.

                                     JANET
                         C'mon honey -- let's get you cleaned 
                         up.

               ANGLE - DAN enters with a bouquet of long-stemmed red roses. 
               He's in a tux and looks very handsome. He crosses to Roberta, 
               hands her the flowers, and they hug.

                                     DAN
                         You're glowing.

                                     ROBERTA
                         It's terror.

               The hall is filling to capacity as people take their seats, 
               the room buzzing with voices.

                         FIVE MINUTE CALL. WE NOW HAVE FIVE 
                         MINUTES.

               The tension in the room shoots sky high.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - PODIUM - NIGHT

               Janet stands onstage and addresses the audience.

                                     JANET
                         When I became the principal of Central 
                         Park East Elementary, I envisioned a 
                         school where children could fulfill 
                         their highest potential, despite the 
                         challenges of poverty and racism. 
                         Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked 
                         into my office because she needed a 
                         job, and because she had a vision 
                         that any child could learn the violin. 
                         We put our dreams together and created 
                         the East Harlem Violin Program which 
                         has helped more than a thousand 
                         students expand their vision of what's 
                         possible in their lives. When a 
                         program like this is cut, our 
                         children's future is compromised. I 
                         want to thank you for your support. 
                         Enjoy the concert.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               In the b.g. we hear the audience APPLAUDING Janet. Roberta 
               holds up her hands to quiet down the anxious students.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Everyone -- attention please!

               They become quiet.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I want you all to take a second just 
                         to breathe, O.K.? Deep breath.

               The kids breathe.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I would like you all to play with 
                         your heart, all right? Play like I 
                         know you can play. You'll be 
                         wonderful. Watch me, don't look out 
                         in the audience -- you don't need to 
                         be afraid. It's gonna be really 
                         wonderful. So play -- play from here.

               She pats her heart.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The kids head out towards the stage, the APPLAUSE getting 
               louder as they get closer.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - NIGHT

               CRANE SHOT of the children on stage, in their positions.

               BACK TO THE STAGE

               Some of the kids look awestruck by the audience; one subtly 
               waves hi to her family. Roberta walks out to APPLAUSE. She 
               bows to the audience, turns to the kids, signals them with a 
               slight nod and the BACH MINUET ONE begins. We've heard it in 
               all phases, and now it is flawless.

               PAN the STUDENTS watching her: VANESSA, wearing a corsage; 
               SIMON in his red bow tie; SHANDRA in black velvet with pearls; 
               NAEEM standing proud and tall, DE SEAN in dreadlocks and a

               chatting and listening to the kids.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - THE STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

               The students finish MINUET ONE. There's an exquisite moment 
               of silence, then APPLAUSE.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - THE STAGE - LATER

               Country fiddler MARK O'CONNOR plays ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL 
               with the kids. He improvises, surprising them as his violin 
               makes the sound of a TRAIN moving through a tunnel.

               RAMON smiles, awed by this -- but he remains calm and 
               professional.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE CORRIDOR - LATER

               As the guest violinists head for the stage, we hear their 
               names over a mike, mixed with APPLAUSE:

                                     MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                         Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Arnold 
                         Steinhardt, Diane Monroe, Michael 
                         Tree, Mark O'Connor and Karen Briggs.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

               CRANE SHOT of the six guest violinists on stage for the Grand 
               Finale, each one sharing a music stand with a student. Roberta 
               nods, and they begin THE BACH DOUBLE CONCERTO. She turns to 
               face the audience as she joins them.

               MOVE IN AND PAN the performers and students: NAAEM shares a 
               stand with ARNOLD STEINHARDT; ISAAC STERN stands and plays 
               with GUADALUPE, sitting beside him; ITZHAK PERLMAN sits and 
               plays next to CARLOS, standing beside him; MICHAEL TREE plays 
               beside DE SEAN; DIANE MONROE plays beside LUCY; KAREN BRIGGS 
               plays beside THOMAS, and MARK O'CONNOR plays beside STEPHANIE. 
               NICK plays cello; LEXI plays the piano behind them; and, 
               playing with her own solo music stand, ROBERTA.

               Their expressions are serious and passionate, broken by 
               occasional smiles lighting on faces: Isaac Stern... Lucy... 
               Carlos... Itzhak Perlman... Diane Monroe... De Sean.

               The song finishes and the APPLAUSE begins. The OTHER 
               FIDDLEFEST PLAYERS come out from back stage, RAMON in front, 
               and join the rest. More applause. The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO 
               INCLUDE the audience facing the stage, then REVERSES to show 
               the audience standing in the orchestra and balconies.

               We see the students' PARENTS; JANET, ISABEL and their 
               families; ASSUNTA, LAWRENCE and DOROTHEA; DAN; CONCEPCION, 
               MANUELO and their sons; BRIAN; and DENNIS -- even he can't 
               stop himself from applauding.

               BACK AGAIN to the stage where the students and guest 
               violinists bow... and MOVE IN CLOSER on ROBERTA in her moment 
               of triumph.

               INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - PODIUM - MOMENTS LATER

               Roberta addresses the audience. Her voice is strong but softer 
               around the edges; she is a woman in a state of grace.

                                     ROBERTA
                         We're all here tonight because we 
                         have a bigger mission: to take the 
                         magical spirit of tonight's concert 
                         with us out into the world, and to 
                         fight for music and art to be a part 
                         of every child's education. Thank 
                         you.

               The APPLAUSE is DEAFENING, then slowly diminishes as we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC CLASSROOM - DAY

               Roberta addresses ten first-graders sitting in a circle on 
               the floor. She points to the horsehair on her bow.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And this? What's this?

                                     BOY
                         The frog hair?

               Roberta and the kids laugh.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Did you ever see a frog with hair?

               The boy smiles and shakes his head.

                                     A FEW KIDS
                         It's horsehair!

                                     ROBERTA
                         That's right.
                              (to the boy)
                         But you're right, there is a frog. 
                         Can you show me where it is?

               One girl raises her hand with urgency.

                                     GIRL
                         Ooh! I know!

                                     ROBERTA
                         Sssh -- let him answer.

               The boy points to the frog of the bow and Roberta smiles. 
               And as she continues her lesson, her voice recedes and we:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END

               CRAWL:

               Roberta Guaspari lives in East Harlem with her daughter Sofia, 
               whom she adopted from El Salvador. Nick is a professional 
               cellist in a graduate music program, and Alexi has been 
               accepted to medical school.

               Roberta teaches violin to approximately 150 students a year 
               in three East Harlem elementary schools. The East Harlem 
               Violin Program, however, is still not funded by the New York 
               City Board of Education.

               The money raised from Fiddlefest supported Roberta's violin 
               program for three years. Roberta and Opus 118 continue their 
               fundraising efforts to keep the program alive.
